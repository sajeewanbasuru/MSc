T1	Book_worthiness 11 95	excellent book however I cannot recommend purchasing the Kindle version of this text
T2	BOOK 103 112	atrocious
T3	Book_readability 124 333	subject headings inserted after the subject is spoken about and, quite often, many heading stacked up on top of each other taking up almost an entire page with useless titles that are in the wrong order anyway
T4	Book_readability 345 360	no page numbers
T5	Book_readability 466 492	tons of hyphenation errors
T6	Book_readability 636 705	difficult to read and navigate due to this horrible Kindle conversion
T7	Book_readability 498 617	delineations between figure notes and the text are almost imperceptible so it is difficult to tell what text goes where
