This is the first time I've actually taken the time to write out a review. I'm sure this book was awesome when it first came out, it is clear, concise and has a nice follow along structure. However, it has become outdated and it is riddled with either old syntax and errors. I have gotten past most of that though. The worst part is probably that the files that are used in some of the examples are hosted on the authors blog and have been taken down. If he can't be bothered to continue hosting old files for people who may buy the book (or point us to somewhere to get them) we shouldn't be bothered to buy it.
