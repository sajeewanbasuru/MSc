Being an avid Ray Kurzweil fan, had expected something interesting from him. For all
practical purposes, i knew that there would be no ground breaking secret revealed.
Rather, i had expected a nice framework, a platform to step upon or at least one new
perspective.

This book is just a slightly different take on Jeff Hawkins work On Intelligence.

By the time, i reached chapter 3 and read about the PRTM, i wanted to quickly read the rest
of the book and get over with it. Somehow, i felt that the book "On Intelligence" by Jeff
Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee was much better and more logical with apt experiments
documented to highlight every point.

This book taught me "Hierarchical hidden markov models", a lot of things that happened at
Ray's former offices, loads of marketing for Nuance and Siri and frankly, nothing else.

Ray, if you happen to read this comment, nothing personal. Just a great fan of yours ranting
about his disappointment here.
