T1	Author_expertise 25 117	one of the most inspiring of all researchers in the field of applied artificial intelligence
T2	AUTHOR 352 442	he does make a good case, albeit somewhat qualitative, for the occurrence, in this century
T3	Book_worthiness 1262 1338	book is aimed primarily at a wide audience, and not professional researchers
T4	Book_Sci-content 1344 1536	author does not include detailed arguments or definitions for the notion of machine intelligence or a list of the hundreds of examples of intelligent machines that are now working in the field
T5	Book_Sci-content 3476 3532	author does not name this phenomenon as such in the book
T6	AUTHOR 3540 3672	reading of it definitely reveals that he is aware of the skepticism expressed by many towards any "advances" in machine intelligence
T7	AUTHOR 3978 4088	he author is one of these, and devotes space in the book to counter various philosophical arguments against AI
T8	AUTHOR 4090 4154	His arguments, although valid, are really a waste of time though
T9	Book_Sci-content 4585 4665	more details on the energy requirements needed to bring about such a singularity
T10	Book_Sci-content 4680 4824	the author needs to sharpen just what he means by intelligence and move away from the Turing test/human brain benchmark that he uses in the book
T11	AUTHOR 5764 5907	author expresses this when he writes in the book that he is not "entirely comfortable" with all the consequences of a technological singularity
T12	AUTHOR 5909 5980	He has though made a fairly strong case for rapidly accelerating change
