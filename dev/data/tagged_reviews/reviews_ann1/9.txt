I've read a half dozen books on the future of AI in the last few months because it plays a peripheral role in a possible novel I have planned and I didn't want to mangle the subject. By far, this book provides the most close minded and overall worst treatment of the subject.

The author is not a computer or AI expert (or even dabbler) but rather a filmmaker whose body of work focuses almost exclusively on middle eastern archeology (really!) for National Geographic (visit his website). He has one single urgent (!) message that does not vary from page one to the very end: AI will soon achieve a level of super intelligence superior to humans and almost immediately (as in minutes to days) wipe out not just humanity and the earth but the entire universe (really, he says things like this). The destruction will be horrific and is already inevitable and unstoppable so you might as well give up now.

The author has no hesitation about putting down the views of any major voice in field who doesn't fully agree with the premise of this novel -- oops, I mean work of scholarship. Most of what little you will find here has been lifted from other more thoughtful works and then sensationalized and beaten into the ground in a self congratulatory I'm smarter than you or anybody else manner. Scattered throughout are a few face to face interviews with fringe figures who totally agree with the author's extreme prejudices and so made the cut.

Unless you like enjoy reading the same ideas (make that idea, in the singular: we're all gonna die) over and over again, sometimes several times on a single page, just scan the title and then skip this junky offering seemingly conceived to shock and titillate.
