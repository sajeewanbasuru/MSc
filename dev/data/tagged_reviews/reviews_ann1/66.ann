T4	AUTHOR 0 33	Segaran has done an excellent job
T5	AUTHOR 160 243	His coding style in Python often reads as clearly as pseudo-code in algorithm books
T6	Book_Sci-content 249 361	examples give real-world grounding to abstract concepts like collaborative filtering and bayesian classification
T7	Book_Sci-content 400 509	code (gives it to us!) that goes out into the world, grabs masses of data and does interesting things with it
T8	Book_price-Value 515 662	use of a hierarchical clustering algorithm to dig into people's intrinsic desires in life as expressed in zebo is worth the price of the book alone
T9	Book_Sci-content 668 832	graph that shows a strong connection between "wife", "kids", and "home" but a different connection between "husband", "children", and "job" is IMHO just fascinating
T10	Book_worthiness 835 893	Gems like that make this book worth reading cover to cover
