After reading this book, your ability to make better decisions will improve a whopping zero. If you 1)want to learn how to make better decisions 2)like to save money because it is precious 3)never enjoyed that Psych 101 course in college despite upper classmen swearing you into believing you will learn the tricks to get the hottest babes, then do not buy this book. On the other hand, if you were a geek like me and enjoyed the self torture in order to obtain intellectual enlightment, then this book is definitely for you. This book will cites what seems like 2 million case studies to show you that humans cannot make right decisions worth crap. I kept reading this book to find the "how to" section on making right decisions, but there was none, making my decision to buy and read this book a wrong one.
