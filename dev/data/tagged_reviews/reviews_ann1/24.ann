T1	Book_Sci-content 266 330	really more of a "Grad Student's Guide to Everyday Python Usage"
T2	Book_worthiness 354 484	very valuable to a mathematics Grad student without too much programming or shell experience, looking for an alternative to Matlab
T3	Book_Sci-content 504 552	very little "Computational Science" in this book
T4	Book_readability 641 709	very verbose 700+ pages, all in an unexciting academic LaTeX format.
T5	Book_Sci-content 894 1019	feels like reading through the author's personal lab notes that he took everytime he learned a new language feature or trick.
