I have read this book in bits and pieces and find it extremely useful. Finally, we got a book that can be used in classroom settings. There are some typos (hence four stars) that will hopefully get fixed in the future editions. The book also has a lot of new insights to offer that can only be gleaned from the vast existing literature on the topic with excruciating labor. Agreed that this book is pricey but for what it has to offer, I think it was money well spent.
