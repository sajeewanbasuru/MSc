I was pretty excited when I heard earlier this year that Yoshua Bengio, Ian Goodfellow, and Aaron Courville were writing this textbook. Just got my copy in the mail today. Read a few chapters and skimmed through some of the book. This is a very comprehensive, well-written, and easy-to-understand textbook on the theoretical foundations, current research, and applications of deep learning. I've read a lot of research papers (DeepMind, Google Brain, Facebook, NYU, Stanford, etc.), blogs (Nervana Systems, Indico, Colah, Otoro's Blog, etc.), lecture notes (Stanford cs231n, cs224d, cs229), and tutorials (Quoc Le's tutorial, TensorFlow, etc.), and have watched a lot of videos (Hugo Larochelle's tutorials, Stanford cs229, TedTalks, lectures by Yann LeCun <3, etc.) to teach myself this topic. Despite the abundance of great resources floating around on the internet, there hasn't been any single thoroughly compiled resource like this. I'm wicked excited to finally own a copy. Many thanks. Shouts from Boston University! :D
