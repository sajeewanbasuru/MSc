The topics and concepts in this book are exceptionally well organized. After reading it from cover to cover, I could easily see how all the ideas and concepts fit into place. I have two main criticisms. First, the notation is sometimes non-standard, e.g. the r vector is used to denote the label vector and superscripts are used sometimes as subscripts. Second, the explanations are sometimes too brief. For example, when deriving the solution for Least Squares Regression with Quadratic Discriminants, Vandermode matrices are used but the author fails to identify them as such, or to explain why they are useful. If the author were to write an extra sentence on every other page, the explanations would be perfect!
