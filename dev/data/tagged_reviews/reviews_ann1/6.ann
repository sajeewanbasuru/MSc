T1	Book_worthiness 5 65	hard to figure out who would actually benefit from this book
T2	Book_Sci-content 71 227	amounts to seven hundred pages of equations interrupted by blocks of text that fail to provide any intuition whatever for the techniques they are describing
T3	Book_Sci-content 263 379	remarkable in the universe of graphs as being scarcely more informative than the equations it is meant to illustrate
T4	AUTHOR 405 448	wonder wtf Bishop thought he was doing here
T5	Book_Sci-content 450 544	As a catalog of equations for people who already thoroughly understand the learning algorithms
T6	Book_worthiness 564 590	can be considered adequate
T7	Book_Sci-content 648 749	can find dense, technically correct but incomprehensible descriptions for any of these methods online
T8	Book_Sci-content 798 915	should bring some order to the chaos, retell a technical story in a new light to make it more sensible and intuitive
T9	Book_worthiness 1036 1132	still the best machine learning / pattern rec. book on the market after thirty years or whatever
