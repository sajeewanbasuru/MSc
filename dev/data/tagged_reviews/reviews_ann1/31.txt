It is a thought provoking book, covering 5 tribes of supervised learning, a bit of unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning and other stuff like chunking and relational learning, etc. It has lots of speculations about the master algorithm which could learn everything. The climax of the book is the circled map of master algorithm. For each topic, it talks about the most important ideas, algorithms and applications, and how are they connected with other tribes. It also emphasize a few common principals: overfit, curse of dimensionality, explore and exploitation, structure learning and parameters learning, etc. The author is very good at explaining in a few simple sentences the gist of an advance algorithm e.g. TD(lambda) and value function approximation in reinforcement learning, message passing, MCMC and Kalman filtering in bayesian, etc.

The author is a bit biased, perhaps 80+% Bayesian, claiming Markov Logic Network is the secret ingredient of master algorithm. I found that part the most unsatisfactory in book, not convinced by the arguments.
