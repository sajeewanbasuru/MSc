I am going to also write a review on "Matlab Guide", I will be also comparing the two books in the reviews.
If you are considering Matlab as a scientific computing language - look no more. It has licensened the "Maple Kernal" as part of its "Math Symbolic ToolBox", it uses LAPAK from FORTRAN for the algorithms for Matrix operations; it uses a high level language (very C++ like) and its own consise syntax for matrix manipulations as well as "Handle Graphics" to produce impressive looking plots and reports. In otherwords, it combines the best of various approaches. If you do not know C++, I advise that learn that first before attempting to learn Matlab.
Comparing "Mastering Matlab 6" (MM6) to "Matlab Guide" (MG):
*Both books are NOT for absolute Beginners, I think the assumption is that you will first study the book that comes with Matlab and the supurb "Help" Documentation that comes with the program. There are also good starting out tutorials on the net - search: "Matlab; Tutorial". The US Navy has a consise tutorial to get you started.
*MM6 does a better job on teaching to the next level beyond the Mathworks supplied documentation and beggining Tutorials.
*MM6 WINS HANDSDOWN ON TEACHING version new to 6.0 specific features. You are short changing yourself by going for a 5.0 text.
*MM6 is geared more towards a programmer/scientist/engineer; whereas, MG is geared to a mathematician. MM6 is comprehensive (800 pages!), but well organized that you can branch off to a given chapter without covering all prior chapters. Because I had a problem to solve, I started on Chapter 18, "Interpolation" without any problems. If you have no immediate issue - taking the book in order is advised. BUT THE BOOK IS WELL CROSS-REFERENCED THAT you can jump ahead to a topc of interest.
**MM6 is real modern: There are 4 chapters (out of 28) that delve into the Object Oriented aspects of Matlab, interfacing to C or Fortran, Extending Matlab with Java and integrating Matlab with Windows using Active X. 7 Chapters are devoted to Graphics, Interface, Movies. 9 Chapters are devoted to Topics that a modern Scientist or Engineer would need to know to take advantage of Matlab: ODEs, Optimization, Fourier Analysis. MM6 covers the topics in detail. Other chapters really get down to the nitty gritty of the Matlab programming language.
I believe that MM6 is ideal for an Engineer/Scientist who is looking for a book to take him or her from the Apprentice to a Journeyman level in Matlab. Beyond that, the books would have to become more specialty (Chem E, Controls,...) orientated. This will get you to the plane where you can then focus on your specialty.
