T1	BOOK 4 44	title of the book is somewhat misleading
T2	Book_Sci-content 196 244	highly recommend, as a prerequisite to this book
T3	Book_Sci-content 318 468	adequate in giving a good introduction and overview of the subject, but not sufficient for calling oneself an "expert" upon successfully digesting it.
T4	Book_Sci-content 593 701	did not seem enough of an introduction for me to feel comfortable using it as a first source of introduction
