I just did the 70-462 exam and passed. I used this book to study, and I augmented with online research based on the objectives listed on the 70-462 web page. The emphasis and focus of this book doesn't line up with the test. I wasted hours studying irrelevant information. My advice, follow the testing objectives on the 70-462 web page and do your research online. Good luck!
