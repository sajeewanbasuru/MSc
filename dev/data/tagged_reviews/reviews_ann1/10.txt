I can appreciate others who might think that this is a great book.... but I am a student using it and I have some very different opinions of it.

First, although Mr. Bishop is clearly an expert in Machine Learning, he is also obviously a HUGE fan of Bayesian Statistics. The title of the book is misleading as it makes no mention of Bayes at all but EVERY CHAPTER ends with how all of the chapter's contents are combined in a Bayes method. That's not bad it's just not clear from the title. The title should be appended with "... using Bayesian Methods"

Second, while it is certainly a textbook, the author clearly has an understanding of the material that seems to undermine his ability to explain it. Though there are mentions of examples there are, in fact, none. There are many graphics and tiny, trivial indicators, but I can't help to think that every single one of the concepts in the book would have benefited from even a single application. There aren't any. I am lead to believe that if you are already aware of many of the methods and techniques that this would be an excellent reference or refresher. As a student starting out I almost always have no idea what his intentions are.

To make matter worse, he occasionally uses symbols that are flat out confusing. Why would you use PI for anything other than Pi or Product? He does. Why use little k, Capital K, and Greek Letter Kappa (a K!) in a series of explanations. He does. He even references articles that he has written... in 2008!!

Every chapter seems to be an exercise to see how many equations he can stuff in it. There are 300 in Chapter 2 alone. Over and over and over again I have the feeling that he is trying to TELL me how to ride a bicycle when it would have been so much easier to at least let me see the view from behind the handle bars with my feet on the pedals. Chapter five on Neural Nets, for example, is abysmally over complicated. Would you hand someone a dictionary and ask them to write a poem? ("Hey, all the words you need are in here!") Of course not.

Third, the book mentions that there is a lot of information available on the web site. The only info available on his website is a brief overview of the text, a detailed overview of the text (that's not a typo.... he has both), an example chapter, links to where the book can be purchased, and (actually, quite useful for creating slides) an archive of all of the figures available in the book. There are no answers to problems or explorations of any part of the material. The upcoming book might be amazing and exactly what I am looking for but it could be months away and another $50 or so to purchase it. Hardly ideal. How about putting some of that MatLab code on your site? *Something* to crystalize the concepts!

Finally, while the intro indicates this might be a good book for Computer Scientists it would actually make more sense to call it a Math book. More specifically a Statistics book. There are no methods, no algorithms, no bits of pseudo code, and (again) no applications are in the text. Even examples that actually used hard numbers and/or elements from a real problem and explained would be much appreciated.

Maybe I am being a little critical and perhaps I want for too much but in my mind if you are writing a book with the goal of TEACHING a subject, it would be in your interest to make things clear and illustrative. Instead, the book feels more like a combination of "I am smart. Just read this!" and a reference text.
