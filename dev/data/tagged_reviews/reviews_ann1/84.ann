T1	Book_Sci-content 36 242	After reading the subtleties of this "math" book (translate: studying-- every sentence is so PACKED with insights, that you can't really just speed "read" this), you'll be stunned, and hungry for a LOT more
T2	Book_Sci-content 245 534	n a very short couple hundred pages, the author integrates everything you've always wondered about how Godel, Cellular Automata / the game of life, thousand page programs of differential equations reduced to two algorithmic lines, Darwinism applied to a new definition of computer learning
T3	Book_Sci-content 801 1106	Valiant twines natural (as in nature) problem solving and learning with the algorithmic processes of neural learning, and potentially machine learning (redefined), and sneakily hints at how the brain can process systems of dynamic partial diffential equations as matrix calculus without us even knowing it
T4	Book_worthiness 1422 1503	this amazing book finally gives the closest I've ever seen to a believable answer
T5	Book_Sci-content 1657 1759	There's no advanced LaTex such as complex exponential superscript equations for e-readers to bugger up
T6	Book_Sci-content 1802 1838	There are polynomials and subscripts
T7	Book_readability 1877 1950	A few of the many diagrams, tables and illustrations are too tiny to view
T8	Book_Sci-content 1994 2059	the underlying math "discussed" really is post grad in some cases
T9	Book_Sci-content 2065 2311	the author doesn't burden us with that level of notation, choosing instead to describe verbally (and with at most inequalities and a few polynomials and tables) the much simpler underlying "ecorithm" (algorithms that learn from their environment)
T10	BOOK 2314 2373	This book is relevant on too many levels to thoroughly list
T11	Book_worthiness 2552 2673	For non math major "lay" readers, the text is crisp, clear, readable/studyable with a nice pace and stories/illustrations
T12	Book_worthiness 2745 2815	I truly believe it will appeal to both lay and pro readers/researchers
T13	AUTHOR 2932 3022	ne of the best teachers you'll ever want to meet, or if you're a technical author, emulate
T14	Book_worthiness 3191 3243	This is better than the whole group of them combined
T15	Book_Sci-content 3341 3403	numerous new insights - discoveries - revelations on each page
T16	AUTHOR 3650 3775	the author is humble in asking us to question HIS insights and discoveries every time he posits one as novel-- a true scholar
T17	Book_worthiness 3903 3930	This is a very well written
