T1	Book_worthiness 59 116	Barber's outstanding text is very suitable for self study
T2	Book_Sci-content 188 346	he carefully explains, with commonsense examples and applications, many of the tougher logical, mathematical and processing foundations of pattern recognition
T3	Book_Sci-content 1254 1408	This text is our "go to" reference for programmers not up to speed in many of the new pattern recognition algorithms, including those writing new versions
T4	Book_Sci-content 1410 1514	All the most recent relevant models, from a probability standpoint, are represented here, with a clarity
T5	Book_Sci-content 1571 1775	, when applying Barber's examples to Bodies of Knowledge and data mining, he skips Prolog, backward chaining, predicate calculus and other techniques that are the foundation of automated inference systems
T6	Book_Sci-content 2156 2197	here IS plenty of calculus in this volume
T7	Book_Sci-content 2341 2463	author's goal of training new algorithm programmers is laudable and right on point for where pattern recognition is headed
T8	Book_Sci-content 2612 2790	the authors here give the what, where when and why of both code and math, not just the how, as their goal is independent, creative contributors who can write their OWN algorithms
T9	Book_readability 2792 2854	There are a few minor UK vs US differences in terminology also
T10	Book_worthiness 3255 3309	This is a happy middle ground that does not disappoint
