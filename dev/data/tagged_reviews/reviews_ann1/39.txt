Since this version of the book is for the Indian market, I was a bit worried about the potential differences from the U.S. 3rd edition. But after doing a first-hand comparison, I found a LOT more similarities than differences.

The biggest difference is the absence of the last two chapters. The U.S. edition includes: Chapter 26, "Philosophical Foundations", which covers arguments over consciousness in machines and the possibility of robot uprisings; and Chapter 27, "AI: The Present and Future", which *briefly* describes some things AI researchers need to work on before we can build a "general-purpose intelligent agent" (a.k.a. one single AI that will be good enough at a lot of different tasks). These two chapters are interesting, but I wouldn't call them core material, so I'm not surprised they got left out.

Other than that, the differences are astonishingly minor. The chapters are unnumbered, and some of them swapped places for no reason, but all the content from chapters 1 through 25 is here, plus the two appendixes. The ONLY edits to the text are removals of cross-chapter references. The U.S. version will say something like, "When we discussed whatzits in Chapter 4, we mentioned that they come in two flavors, X and Y", while the same line in this book will say, "Whatzits come in two flavors, X and Y". Again, those are the ONLY edits. All the other sentences are the same. The equations are the same. The diagrams are the same. The exercises at the end of each chapter are the same.

In short, if you can do without those last two chapters, buy this version and save your money.
