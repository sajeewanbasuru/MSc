This book was the textbook for the Machine Learning course I've taken and I can't say I found it very useful for learning the material on my own. This book is much more of a reference book than a self-learning book. It feels like the author's purpose was to include all the material in the field into a single, huge book. From that perspective, this is probably the most expansive book; you won't probably find any book talking about deep learning for example. However, when you're reading this book, you feel like the book was a bit rushed, it wasn't quite ready to be published. There is at least one typo in every page and a lot of them makes you wonder how that typo was missed. For example, all the algorithm references in text use wrong numbers.
One other thing, maybe again because it was a bit rushed, the book is not well organized. Most of the time you feel like the author took a bunch of sections written in different times and simply pasted them one after another. There is no coherent narrative that takes you through the text.
In short, although I appreciate the effort, I must say I'm disappointed with this book, especially given the hype about this book. I think this book needs some serious review, and first of all some proofreading.
