I use data mining tools in my financial engineering and financial modeling work and I have found this book to be very useful. This book provides two crucial types of information. First, it provides enough theory to allow a potential user to understand the essential insights that motivate specific techniques and to evaluate the situations in which those technique are appropriate. Second, the book gives the exact algorithms to implement the various techniques.
While no book I have seen covers every data mining methodology available, this one has the strongest coverage I have seen in additive models, non-linear regression, and CART/MART (regression/classification trees). It also has very strong coverage in many other areas. I highly recommend it.
