I'm sure if you are a Google Research Scientist and are not learning the material for the first time, this book is amazing. For everyone else, I would not recommend it. I bought this book for my Fall 2013 COMPSCI 571 class, and I regret it. Before buying this book, consider the following:

1. Take a look at the online Errata. This book is already in it's 3rd printing and it just came out. The list of corrections for this (the 3rd edition) is already mind numbingly long. The 4th printing coming out this month will surely fix some errors, but there are just too many.
2. Our class has an online forum (for a 100 person class) where we discuss topics, and most questions are either (a) basic topics from the book that no one understood or (b) talking about how one figure in the book has multiple errors associated with it. At first I was really excited to find mistakes and submit them to the Errata - it was like I was part of the book! Now I just get frustrated and have already given up on submitting corrections.
3. Our instructor regrets using this book and modifies the examples before giving them to us in class. Our out of class readings now consist mostly of MetaAcademy.com.
4. There are hardly any worked through examples, and many of those that are worked through have errors.
5. Many important concepts are skimmed over way too quickly. For example, there is a whole chapter on Logistic regression. However, Logistic regression is covered for exactly 2 pages. Then a weird 3D graph is presented but not explained (a common theme throughout the book is graphs that look absolutely amazing, but which convey little information as to exactly what's going on to a lay person like me), then the rest of the chapter presents methods for doing the math, which I'm sure are useful in some sense, but I'm still thinking: "why is this MLE not in closed form, what is a Hessian doing here... and wtf is going on?!"

Most students just got the PDF for free online, and I would highly suggest doing something other than paying $55 for this book.
