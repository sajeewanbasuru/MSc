This guide about the echo is a quick and easy to use instruction manual that you can read through if you want to explore the device and experience the power of it.I learned a lot from this book, and for me, this book is very informative. Using the book as a walk through manual worked very well and I feel like I really understand the product very well due to the book. This book was written for people who are new to Echo and who are non-computer nerds.I highly recommended this book.
