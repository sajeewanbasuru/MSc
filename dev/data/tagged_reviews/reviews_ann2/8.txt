Using Python and NumPy code to teach machine learning is a great idea. Well-written Python is so easy to understand that it's often called 'executable pseudocode', and third-party extensions such as NumPy and SciPy make it competitive with platforms like Matlab for math and science application programming. The author seems to know his subject, and he had another good idea when deciding to structure the book around the ten most popular machine learning algorithms (though he only ends up covering eight of them for reasons he explains in the introduction). Unfortunately, the book is poorly written and even more poorly edited; it reads like a very rough draft that was put once through a spell-checker and then published. The text is repetitive, confused, and often doesn't match up with the code and data sets to which it refers. Color-coded figures are published (in the print edition) in black and white. I'd hesitate to trust this author and publisher again (not to mention the reviewers who gave the book four or five stars).
