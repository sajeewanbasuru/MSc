I found the reviews and blurbs very intriguing, and once I had the book I didn't put it down until I had read it all.

This book does *not* have the kind of science-is-wonder attitude you might find in Sagan; it does not convey the message "Study science, it's a noble thing to do, your curiosity will be greatly rewarded", like some reviewers write. It's not the kind of book that summarizes the state of what's known about the brain today, while getting you excited about finding out more.

This book is really a monograph by someone who thinks they have literally figured out the brain, and it contains mostly what the author has to say. So you won't see a mention of the holographic theory of the brain, or the brain-as-dynamic-system view. In my opinion, in a book addressed to the general public, that's a problem.

It's a problem, because on one hand the book is written for the general public, while on the other hand it presents utterly untested (by anyone, even the author) hypotheses, mostly made by the author himself or hand-picked from existing research.

In this respect, it reminds one of "A New Kind of Science" by Stephen Wolfram, another "scientific" book which aims to directly impress the layman with something he's not likely to understand, while bypassing specialists.

Next, what annoyed me somewhat is the the fact that the subject, admittedly the biggest mystery of our time, is given such a simplistic treatment. No, we're no closer to creating something that can, say, semi-intelligently fly around the room and land on things, or since the author prefers non-behavioral intelligence, detect whether a given picture has a cat in it. So why such extraordinary claims of no results were obtained?

Finally, there is no evidence that the author or his colleagues have actually built any software or hardware that can detect any meaningful patterns in visual or audio streams.

Yet, I'd still recommend this book, because it highly readable, and it'll make you think (even if it's about the outrageous claims). Because of that it gets four stars.
