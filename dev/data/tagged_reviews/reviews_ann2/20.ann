T1	Book_Sci-content 33 97	a book on R, with some additional time spent on machine learning
T2	Book_Sci-content 109 137	way too much time spent on R
T3	Book_Sci-content 491 542	more interesting R functions are given short shrift
T4	Book_Sci-content 553 638	some good material in here, but it's buried under the weight of doing everything in R
T5	Book_worthiness 849 954	'd recommend Programming Collective Intelligence by Segaran, if you would describe yourself as a "Hacker"
