Until recently, my Algorithms book was my favorite text book ever. However, AI: A Modern Approach has supplanted it. This book is the most thoughtfully designed, easily understandable, clear text I've ever used in over 28 years of attending schools. I really knew nothing about AI when I took my first grad class in AI, but this book, along with a pretty great instructor, has been a wonderful resource, more than any other book I've used. I have not need to google for more information or speak to the professor. The answers are here--clear and concrete.

Have no fear and trust this book!
