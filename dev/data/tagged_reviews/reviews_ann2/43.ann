T1	BOOK 63 75	well written
T2	Book_readability 84 151	figures are really pretty because they are in color and informative
T3	Book_worthiness 153 210	Overall the book looks very nice and it is fun to read in
T4	Book_worthiness 324 424	book is a textbook rather than a monograph and, hence, intended for students rather than researchers
T5	Book_Sci-content 433 530	coverage of machine learning topics is thorough without being able to cover every topic in deepth
T6	Book_readability 610 758	presentation of the methods is informative and, depending on the background of the reader, clear enough to figure out how it works to use the method
T7	Book_Sci-content 784 859	do not like that the methods are introduced not rigourously but by examples
T8	AUTHOR 871 949	Bishop does not have the definiton, theorem, proof style but is more heuristic
T9	Book_worthiness 951 1021	This may sound very helpful for the reader not familiar with the topic
T10	Book_worthiness 1475 1508	I give only 4 instead of 5 points
T11	Book_worthiness 1597 1698	Overall, the book is well done and certainly a good source of information for students and researches
