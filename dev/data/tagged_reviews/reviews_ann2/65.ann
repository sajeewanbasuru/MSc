T1	Book_worthiness 207 335	For me, Charles Petzold's The Annotated Turing falls into that last category (as well, of course, as the informational category)
T2	Book_worthiness 342 419	a book worth reading not only for the topic itself but the way it's presented
T3	Book_Sci-content 430 655	provides the necessary background before working through Turing's famous 1936 paper "On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem" with rich annotations at every stage, including biographical details
T4	Book_worthiness 658 841	If you are interested in the foundation of mathematics, computability, Turing's work, or even just ways of explaining mathematics in a historical context, I highly recommend this book
