T1	Author_expertise 1575 1842	author of this book has been one of these "directors" throughout his professional career, and even though some of his writings have a speculative air about them, many others have been very useful as guidance to those working in the trenches of artificial intelligence
T2	AUTHOR 1844 1934	One can point to the author's writings as both inspiration and as a source of perspiration
T3	AUTHOR 2024 2268	It would be incorrect to state that the author's ideas have played a predominant role in the field of artificial intelligence, but his influence has been real, if sometimes even in the negative, such as his commentary on the role of perceptrons
