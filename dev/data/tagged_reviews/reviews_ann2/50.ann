T1	BOOK 2195 2310	What I like most about the book is that it doesn't try to wave a magic data wand to cure all of your company's ills
T2	Book_Sci-content 2320 2453	it focuses on a few areas where data and analytic techniques can deliver a concrete benefit, and gives you just enough to get started
T3	Book_Sci-content 2936 3096	but all of the techniques are "tried and true" in the sense of being widely deployed at large companies with big analytics budgets and teams of Ph.D.'s on staff
T4	Book_worthiness 3098 3238	This book's contribution is to make these techniques available to anyone with a little background in applied mathematics and a copy of Excel
T5	Book_worthiness 3327 3375	I think Data Smart is an important business book
T6	Book_readability 3563 3654	Some of the chapters ran on a bit long, but these have been split up into manageable pieces
T7	Book_readability 3656 3739	The Optimization chapter is a bit of a doozie, and used to be at the very beginning
T8	Book_Sci-content 3749 3844	reader can now "warm up" with some easier chapters on clustering and simple Bayesian techniques
T9	Book_Sci-content 4075 4164	I would have liked to see more on quantile regression, which is only mentioned in passing
T10	Book_Sci-content 4230 4287	book by Koenker has good but highly mathematical coverage
T11	Book_Sci-content 4493 4595	Data Smart is a well-written and engaging guide to getting new insights from data using familiar tools
T12	Book_Sci-content 4597 4638	The techniques aren't really cutting-edge
T13	Book_readability 5146 5187	the prose is engaging and extremely clear
