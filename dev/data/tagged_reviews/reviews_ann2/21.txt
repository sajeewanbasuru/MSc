If you don't know much about real-world AI research and/or you're totally unfamiliar with the nonfiction concerns about the risks it poses, then this book is a quick and easy read that will make you aware of the basics. However, the author is himself clearly non-technical and has a sensationalist style that feels too much like tabloid writing.

When I started reading it, I began bookmarking pages with passages that struck me as problematic. I thought I might write a short review on my wife's tech blog, or perhaps for LessWrong. But as I read further, I realized there were so many problem areas that I'd never bother to sit down and address them individually. Again, these problems would only matter to a technical audience -- experienced programmers, people with a more-than-passing-interest in AI, and so on.

This is my big problem with the book: It's a critically important subject which deserves better treatment than this. Barrat seems to understand the basic problem well enough, but much of the time I had the feeling his primary goal was hitting a page-count target. For example, most of the section about malware is largely irrelevant to the real problem, but it felt like one of the longer chapters in the book (I didn't bother to confirm this, that's just my impression). His TV documentary background shows at the start of each paragraph: each time I felt like I was coming back from a commercial break. He'll shoot somebody down in one chapter, then use that same person to support his argument in the next. He tosses around concepts like cognitive bias and logical fallacies apparently without realizing the book is mostly one big appeal to authority. There is a very good, very important story here waiting to be told. This book only scratches the surface.

I've been a programmer for 36 years. I played around AI-related things back in the late 80s, and I recently became interested in it again. I believe it has great promise, but I do agree that it is also terrifyingly dangerous (in the "existential-threat" sense), and that insufficient attention and respect is being given to the problem. For that reason I'm giving this three stars -- it is a tremendously important subject. If it wasn't for that, I'd probably be one of those "drive-by" one- or two-star "spammers" Barrat likes to rant about in his replies to less-than-fawning reviews.

If you're non-technical, buy it and read it, and don't stop here. If you're a technical type, hit up the LessWrong website as a good jumping-off point for learning more about what is really going on today. Many more technical people need to be thinking about this, concerned about this, and ultimately *doing something* about it.
