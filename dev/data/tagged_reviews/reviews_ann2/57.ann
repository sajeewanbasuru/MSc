T1	BOOK 9 77	provides the right amount of theory and practice, unlike the earlier
T2	AUTHOR 332 374	authors make no pretense about this either
T3	Book_Sci-content 693 820	an excellent introduction to Learning due to the ability of the authors to strike a perfect balance between theory and practice
T4	Book_Sci-content 822 1001	Theory is there to aim the reader as to understand the purpose and the "R Labs" at the end of each chapter are as valuable (or perhaps even more) than the end-of-chapter exercises
T5	AUTHOR 1702 1839	wo of the authors (Hastie & Tibshirani) are offering a 10-week free online course (StatLearning: Statistical Learning) based on this book
T6	BOOK 2279 2328	the course videos are less detailed than the book
T7	AUTHOR 2336 2406	certainly nice, though, to see the actual authors explain the material
