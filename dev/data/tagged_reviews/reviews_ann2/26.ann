T3	Book_Sci-content 650 708	All four are exceptional in their detail, but somewhat dry

T7	Book_Sci-content 1437 1689	It assumes that information technologies, growing exponentially, will solve world hunger, eliminate disease, replenish water, create renewable energy, and allow all of us to have the bodies we want, and to see and feel in our mates the bodies they want
T8	Book_Sci-content 1906 2151	book is, in short, divorced from the humanities and the human condition, and devoid of any understanding of the pathos and pathology of immoral governments and corporations that will do anything they can to derail progress that is not profitable

T14	Book_Sci-content 2849 3131	there is an interesting schism between the Kurzweil-Gates gang that believes they can rule the world with machines; and the Atlee-Wheatley gang that believes that collective **human** intelligence, with machines playing a facilitating but not a dominant role, is the desired outcome

T15	Book_Sci-content 4507 4604	hints at a future that may not be achieved, not for lack of technology, but for lack of good will
T17	Book_Sci-content 5556 5738	Neither the author of this book, nor the Google Triumverate, seem to grasp the moral implications of technology run amuk without respect for ethics, privacy, copyright, humanity, etc
