Ray Kurzweil writes as an authority on AI (artificial intelligence). As a practitioner in that field myself, I am not impressed by his expertise. He knows one or two subfields of AI well and is a talented inventor, but his vision of the future of AI simply doesn't hold water.

An informed layman who has never read an AI textbook (or history, such as Nils Nilsson's or Pamela McCorduck's) and knows nothing about cognitive neuroscience (see recent books by Michael Gazzaniga and V. S. Ramachandran) may find this book impressive. It is a place where a great deal of mediocre information is contained between two covers. However, I don't think Kurzweil knows enough about human learning (a large and complex field) and human intelligence (ditto) to get a solid handle on what tasks machine learning and machine intelligence must be able to perform and in what order their respective subtasks will probably be mastered.

There are gifted multidisciplinary thinkers in AI and cognitive science who have proved their ability to run rings around Kurzweil, and none of them purports to be a "futurist." Ever since Herbert A. Simon predicted (in 1957) that in a decade the strongest chess player in the world would be a machine (it was four decades before IBM's DEEP BLUE beat World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov in tournament play in May, 1997), serious AI researchers have been very cautious in making predictions about the not-so-near future.

There is an established literature on mind design and Kurzweil has contributed very little to it. This book does not summarize that literature or move it forward. I sincerely doubt it will be remembered five years from now. There are too many good people, from Steven Pinker (who explains the mind for those who aren't experts in it) and John Robert Anderson (one of the experts) to Daniel Dennett and Patricia Churchland (the latter two being examples of a brave new philosophy of mind), who have made contributions to how minds can realistically be designed for us to waste our time with the mediocre thoughts of "futurists" and others who aren't telling us a believable story about how they will be built.

We already know a great deal more about mind design and implementation than Ray Kurzweil does, a field I was working in more than 30 years ago. To be blunt, Kurzweil isn't plugged into enough of the right sources of information.
