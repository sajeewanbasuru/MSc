T1	Book_readability 116 148	this book, which is easy to read
T2	Book_Sci-content 153 210	filled with concrete solutions and lots of supporting dat
T3	Book_worthiness 216 235	near-perfect for me
T4	Book_readability 345 485	Even the ones with good information (eg, Fodor's Modularity) are hard to read and filled with confusing, field-specific words. Not this book
T5	Book_readability 513 559	Written in plain English, very few assumptions
T6	Book_Sci-content 561 630	very thorough analysis, lots of self-criticism, lots and lots of data
T7	Book_Sci-content 733 917	Common AI, psych and economic decision and learning algorithms (decision trees, neural nets, Bayes, multiple linear regression, etc.) are compared to several absurdly simple algorithms
T8	Book_Sci-content 955 1133	The various approaches are compared and evaluated on the basis of performance, accuracy on training data, accuracy on test data (generalization) and amount of input data required
T9	Book_Sci-content 1135 1194	Tests are on the standard UC Irvine data learning test sets
T10	Book_Sci-content 1196 1294	Comparisions, outcome explanations and relevance to the human mind and the real world are provided
T11	Book_Sci-content 1296 1368	Explanations and analysises are easy to understand and pretty convincing
T12	Book_worthiness 1506 1533	i absolutely love this book
