Everything I wished in a book to apply machine learning techniques for trading is here! I began reading the book in the evening and could not put it down. I ran through all of the Python machine learning algorithms and by 3am had a complete understanding of how to put the lessons into practice. A decent trading system in Python is provided with code. This is using logistic regression and some very simple RSI based predictor variables. Change the predictor variables a bit more to get significantly better results.

A bit about my background so you know what I'm writing about:

I'm an individual trader. I have about 10 years of trading experience and all of it was using trading system development platforms (not machine learning). After experimenting with many platforms such as Tradestation, Ninjatrader, Telechart, StockFinder I settled on Amibroker as my platform since 2011. I consider myself a competent user of Amibroker. I also have Dr Bandy's prior books and consider them outstanding.

I have a software development background and early in career (almost 20 years ago) was exposed to some machine learning concepts. My application of machine learning was however, not for trading or any financial services. My machine learning experience was using C and C++ as programming languages. Since 2012, I elected to learn Python and have come to use it and love it!

Given my machine learning exposure I have been on the lookout for books that bridge the gap between theory and their application to trading. Quantitative Technical Analysis does that extremely well. Just to be clear, this book is a great asset if you use Amibroker and have no intention of using machine learning methods, but I'll focus my review on the topics of my interest -- namely the application of machine learning using Python to trading.

Here is what I loved about the chapter progressions:

- The opening chapters discuss the key concepts with respect to key risk in trading -- the risk of drawdowns and provide a framework for managing this risk algorithmically. I have learnt tremendously from Dr Bandy's prior books and welcome this summary of the concepts along with more and detailed explanation of the concepts.

- Next, the design of a trading system are considered. Assume a system accuracy and maximum holding period, what is the profit potential and draw down?

- Armed with the knowledge from the earlier step, now the implementation of the actual trading system is tackled. This is where the books is unique. It provides the classic (what Dr Bandy call's the indicator based approach) way of developing systems using a platform like Amibroker and in *parallel*, introduces the use of Python as a platform for trading development. For me, this was a great way to bridge the concepts of system development using Amibroker to Python. Amibroker with its rich library of indicators and charts and access to data sources makes many things easy. Python, on the other hand, is a great language for complex analysis of data and monte carlo simulations. Comparing the two approaches side-by-side makes it easy to decide the approach you want to take. (I'll take a hybrid approach for now).

- Next, the use of machine learning to predict prices is introduced. For me, this was the part I have been waiting for a long time. Dr Bandy takes the classic Iris classification problem to illustrate the various machine learning algorithms (from the now widely available scikit Python ML library). He then follows up with a real trading system (using logistic regression as the algorithm). This is a fully functional system and if you follow the Iris examples, you can easily experiment with different learning algorithms. If you have prior exposure to machine learning concepts, you should be up and running with a working system in a few hours (like me). If you are new to machine learning, this is the best book I know of that takes the concepts of machine learning, combines them with freely available Python code and libraries and free data sources and puts you in a position to advance your learning about real trading systems.

- A Python implementation of the dynamic position sizing technique is introduced. The concept of dynamic position sizing, once explained, seems intuitive and obvious. What is challenging is the actual execution of the concept. This book provided a complete working example. Heck, the "for education only" examples here are a lot better than many production systems.It provides a daily management of the position size of the trade based on changing risk conditions. It is brilliant!

Very few books can boast of providing working examples and fewer can boast of working examples that work for the reader. Dr Bandy has set a high bar with his prior books so we've come to expect this. Still, getting all of the Python code to work withing hours of getting the book is an amazing testament to his attention to detail. If you are at all interested in applying machine learning to trading, getting this book is a nobrainer!.
