I have been working with Timothy Moser's online Spanish learning materials. Having studied Spanish over the years, the Accelerated Spanish approach is amazingly different. It starts with the most used words and builds on that foundation. After a couple of lessons you will know about 25% of the language. But that is only the beginning. As you explore Joel's world, you will build visual memories of the necessary words and grammar to accelerate your learning.

The online course uses many of the same visuals but the book is so much better. It combines the materials spread over multiple links online in one place. The pictures are more professional and lodge themselves more firmly in your memory.

If you have any interest in learning Spanish, try this approach. You will enjoy it.
