The best guide to take the most out from your echo device. My son bought a new echo and gift me the old one, but he is in a different state so I needed a bit of assistance, I decided to get this book and I'm very comfortable with it, I could know better what does my new echo have inside and how I can get the best of it. The set up was made very easy so I decided to make all the initial configurations needed to get the best. Knowing the echo's functions, what does every light and sound means, and linking the echo to its own app is great to improve the way you can interact with Alexa.

This book easily teached me the features I was not being able to found, like linking the echo with other home devices and setting up my music playlist. Also loved the tips and the fun tricks that were added to this book!. If you need your echo to do something, sure you'll find out how on this book.
