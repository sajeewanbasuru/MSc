I started looking through this on the hunt for an introductory text and put it down. The number of books coming out purportedly in English from Indian writers in India concerns me. The language does not parse; the grammar is ambiguous. Missing subjects and lack of basic subject-verb agreement are just the beginning. As a beginning student, it is not worth it to try to slog through a text where even basic meaning and the author's points are not clear. You'd think that by the time they get to a second edition they would bother to get it reviewed and edited properly by a native English speaker.

How are people giving this five starts? I'd hypothesize that they're not native English speakers or they have more familiarity with the subject matter.
