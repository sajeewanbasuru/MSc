T1	Book_worthiness 22 91	do not purchase this book expecting it to teach you math fundamentals
T2	Book_worthiness 93 279	If you do not have a background of at least algebra and trigonometry (and preferably a bit of calculus), you owe it to yourself to pick up another book and brush up on these fundamentals
T3	Book_Sci-content 287 412	there are a few appendices covering a handful of topics, they are less about explaining the topic and more of reference pages
T4	Book_worthiness 415 528	Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics is an excellent reference book for anyone doing 3D work
T5	Book_Sci-content 530 620	The topics are very to the point and few pages are wasted explaining basic math principles
T6	Book_Sci-content 684 825	book probably won't teach anyone who doesn't know they underlying principles but will be your go-to reference for any algorithm you implement
T7	Book_Sci-content 828 1028	The book starts with the reviews of the requisite vector, matrix, transformation (including rotations by quaternions) and basic geometry for a view frustum, but quickly dives into more advanced topics
T8	Book_Sci-content 1030 1105	Ray tracing is covered for all areas of use, from light maps to reflections
T9	Book_Sci-content 1107 1258	The lighting chapter covers texturing using several map types as well as lighting models with a very enjoyable discussion of specular reflection models
T10	Book_Sci-content 1261 1397	Solid chapters on culling using bounding volumes and portal systems, shadowing and curve algorithms round out the first half of the book
T11	Book_Sci-content 1399 1530	The second half is devoted to the mathematics of physics, with chapters on basic collision detection, linear and rotational physics
T12	Book_Sci-content 1532 1766	The simulation of fluids and cloth (one of the more difficult physical models to accurately compute in a game) gets it's own chapter and it's a highlight for anyone implementing character clothing animation or a realistic water volume
T13	Book_Sci-content 1769 1827	Every chapter has exercises (with and appendix of answers)
T14	Book_worthiness 2015 2091	Anyone who needs a math reference book for 3D would do well to own this book
T15	Book_worthiness 2094 2208	f you are writing your own engine, you owe it to yourself to pick up what will be the only math book you will need
T16	BOOK 2254 2339	this hardcover book will last through many late-night coding sessions both physically
T17	Book_price-Value 2344 2399	with regard to the material within at a low price point
T18	AUTHOR 2527 2598	The author has done the impossible; make a truly terrific math textbook
