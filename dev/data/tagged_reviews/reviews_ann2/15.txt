Too lightweight for a practitioner to learn much from it other than the ML World of Pedro Domingos. Yet at the same time too buzzwordy for someone outside the field to really learn anything substantial/actionable from it. Neural Networks, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, Classifiers, and Genetic Algorithms are really not all that complicated to understand (though admittedly sometimes hard to implement), and they have been explained better elsewhere. To that end, I highly recommend Michael Nielsen's online book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning."
