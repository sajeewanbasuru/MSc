Jerry Kaplan does for the future what Jared Diamond did for the past: He pulls together our human (or humanoid) fate in sparkling,often hilarious, prose.

Kaplan begins by offering the non scientific reader (me) a clear overview of the AI advances that are poised to make human workers obsolete--offering eye popping examples explaining how the pace of technology is destined to overwhelm the human landscape of life and work.

He then charts the changes that span FAR more than driverless cars. Mechanical robots (or what Kaplan calls "forged intelligences") will be more adept (and. of course, far more cost effective) than humans at performing every routine job from collecting our garbage to stocking our grocery shelves (and make those physical stores quaint relics of the past). "Synthetic intelligences" (machines that think and analyze information) will outwit humans at making complex diagnoses or writing legal briefs--automating out many of the hapless law school or medical students spending decades accumulating those mountainous student debts .

So far readers may be saying " I know all that stuff". Actually, you don't. The real gem of this book is that Kaplan CALCULATES how many people enter the workforce with those mountains of debt and compares their expected salaries. He analyzes the current employment situation for new law school grads and other "knowledge workers". He offers a wealth of data documenting how many jobs are going to be lost... beginning with that prime exemplar (AKA job wrecker), Amazon. I always wanted to know how Amazon evolved, the truth about this behemoth's business model, and how many jobs Amazon has automated out... In this book you will actually get these statistics and much more, as well as learning exactly why those standard government "job growth projection" stats are apt to be totally wrong.

In other words, as you read in these other reviews , this book is all about income inequalities and what we can do to in Kaplan's words to slow the transition to making "America the Land of the Pharaohs" ( You ain't seen nothing yet). In fact the chapter--of this title- describing the lifestyles of Kaplan and his much richer colleagues versus one of his hardworking employees is the best in- the- flesh description of income inequalities I've read.

Kaplan has the huge advantage of personally knowing these billionaire Silicon Valley movers and shakers--in addition to having a birds eye seat on how these technologies evolved. But, most important, he has a gift for bringing it all home through creative analogies and zinger-like sentences that had me rolling on the floor. So if you like Jared Diamond, or even if you don't know who he is, you will LOVE this landmark book.

P.S. I've omitted the fact that Kaplan also suggests answers.. that is, he devises highly innovative policy suggestions to make playing field less steep that come closer to attacking the roots of the problem and go well beyond the current mantras such as increasing access to college or raising the minimum wage......
