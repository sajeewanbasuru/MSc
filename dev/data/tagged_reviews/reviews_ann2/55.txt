This book does 2 things:
(1) goes through the historical events that led to our modern stock market and
(2) tries to explain what is going on in market microstructure.

The book does very well on (1) -- it's really an enjoyable book to read. But on (2) there's almost no information, no analytic discussion about microstructure, and some of the comparisons and conclusions are simply wrong. For example, the Patterson compares the immediate liquidity with the days of the past comparing the top of the book orders and noticing that today you have fewer orders at the top of the book. But this is misleading. In the past when the spread was at least 25 cents (due to regulation, ie, in increments on 1/8ths, but also in part of the gentleman's agreement between specialists to keep the spreads large) and now the spread is mostly 1 cent for most stocks. To compare apples to apples you need to sum up the liquidity on 25 levels in the current market, because basically these 25 levels would have been aggregated into 1 level in the past. Once you do this comparison, it's clear that the order book today has much more immediate liquidity.

In spite of the title, another thing that's missing in the book is a discussion of dark pools. Obviously, there's a much bigger problem with dark pools today than with the lit market, mainly because the dark pools can legally do prop trading (and they do) on the flow they see, but in the same time they are marketing a hidden market. This is simply wrong and should have been discussed.

The author points out that the market is unfair, in the sense knowledge of market micro-structure gives some players an advantage. But the market was never fair. For example, players with knowledge about a stock have an advantage, even if that knowledge is public. The same with micro-structure. The rules of the micro-structure are published. Anybody can read the order types for the exchanges and the information is public. In the past it wasn't the case (specialists had privileges) In today's market the differentiation is more about technical competence and less about specialists born with entitlements. Moreover, the transaction costs for investors are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than during the time of the specialists. (I've never seen a single study that claims otherwise) In other words, it'd be unfair to draw Kasparov in a chess tournament, but at least you start with the same pieces (which was not the case during the rule of the specialists)

The author also doesn't compare the state of the stock market with our other markets: futures (futures is much cleaner), FX (dirty business, where banks have a separate inter market with tighter spreads for themselves, plus the broken will do prop trades against you) and OTC contracts, say corporate bonds (huge 1% spreads, little liquidity, the bank will own you). In other words the stock market is the most fair, except maybe for futures (1 exchange, no fragmentation, no complicated rules, latency less of an issue), and way more fair than FX and OTC. The few big banks that own the OTC business have a lot to gain from HFT bashing, as they really don't want their business on a lit exchange.

I only give 5 stars because it's an enjoyable book to read and does a good job at (1). Patterson is an outsider, but he did a good job at (1) that it reads like a novel. There are a few competing books about HFT for the average reader and all of them are worse than Pattersen's book:

1. "All About High-Frequency" (Durbin) - written by an insider, does reveal a little about market microstructure, but a very introductory book. Readable by anybody.
2. "Speed Traders" (Perez) - a book which was quickly assembled as a series of interviews, and Mr Perez is using the book to make a name for himself as a consultant for HFT. (his name is constantly on PR wire and he organizes all sorts of events)
3. "Broken Markets" (Arnuk, Saluzzi) - full of factual lies, written by old school specialists that use smarts to trade, which are bitter for losing business with the modernization of the exchanges, and want the fat 25 cents spreads back.

For the technically inclined that want to learn about market microstructure, there are a few more quantitative book, but they are all dry and not much fun to read.
