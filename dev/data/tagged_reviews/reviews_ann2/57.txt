The book provides the right amount of theory and practice, unlike the earlier (venerable and, by now, stable) text authored (partly) by the last two authors of this one (Elements of Statistical Learning), which was/is a little heavy on the theoretical side (at least for practitioners without a strong mathematical background). The authors make no pretense about this either. The Preface says "But ESL is intended for individuals with advanced training in the mathematical sciences. An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) arose from the perceived need for a broader and less technical treatment of these topics."

ISL is neither as comprehensive nor as in-depth as ESL. It is, however, an excellent introduction to Learning due to the ability of the authors to strike a perfect balance between theory and practice. Theory is there to aim the reader as to understand the purpose and the "R Labs" at the end of each chapter are as valuable (or perhaps even more) than the end-of-chapter exercises.

ISL is an excellent choice for a two-semester advanced undergraduate (or early graduate) course, practitioners trained in classical statistics who want to enter the Learning space, and seasoned Machine Learners. It is especially helpful for getting the fundamentals down without being bogged down in heavy mathematical theory, a great way to kick-off corporate Learning units, or as an aid to help statisticians and learners communicate better.

A needed and welcome addition to the Learning literature, authored by some of the most well respected names in industry and academia. A classic in the making. Recommended unreservedly.

UPDATE (12/17/2013): Two of the authors (Hastie & Tibshirani) are offering a 10-week free online course (StatLearning: Statistical Learning) based on this book found at Stanford University's Web site (Starting Jan. 21, 2014). They also say that "As of January 5, 2014, the pdf for this book will be available for free, with the consent of the publisher, on the book website." Amazing opportunity! Enjoy!

UPDATE (04/03/2014): I took the course above and found it very helpful and insightful. You don't need the course to understand the book. If anything, the course videos are less detailed than the book. It is certainly nice, though, to see the actual authors explain the material. Also, the interviews by Efron and Friedman were a nice touch. The course will be offered again in the future.
