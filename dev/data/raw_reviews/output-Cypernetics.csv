Iron Man,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Blow-your-mind simplicity!,"So simple and yet so complex! I am into Deming and Goldratt - so a manufacturing concept of a 'system', so I thought I knew what a system was. However, this is not that...not that at all. Meadows' system model has three entities - stocks (a stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within the system - think 'dam', or 'bank account'). Flows - things flow in an out of stocks - think the feeding streams, or dam outflow, or the wife on a shopping spree), and feedback loops ('a closed chain of causal connections from a stock that are dependent on the level of a stock, and that act through a flow - water level in a dam determining how much water is released, or the above-said wife showing off her new frock to her friends, and hearing that she should buy a matching pair of shoes).

With these three entities, an entire world (literally) of complexity can be modeled. Now, I know a thing or two about models, and that's an impressive redaction.

Also, well written, interesting - especially fascinating is the model of exploitation of non-renewable resources. Did someone say Keystone Pipeline?",1
Alexei Kondratov,4.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,"Good and insightful ""soft"" introduction into thinking about systems","(Note: this was my first book on the subject)
Rather than an academic introduction into system modeling (or thinking), this book is more about insights that can be taken from system modeling. Did I learn from it how to formally model systems? No. But I certainly got a better sense of what makes systems tick. The less formal style makes the book an easy read with many examples taken from ecology and economics.
The book broadly discusses several topics:
- Fundamental characteristics and elements of systems (stocks, flows, feedback loops).
- Examples of simple systems (e.g. exploitation of a renewable resource).
- Typical systemic dysfunctions.
- Leverage points for system changes.
(As an author of ""The Limits to Grows"" Donella H. Meadows do have her educated position on economics and ecology, which is evident from examples. It may be a pro or con depending on what you want from the book.)

Overall it's a good and insightful ""soft"" introduction into thinking about systems.",3
L. Lauri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,A thorough introduction into holistic thinking,"The book outlines useful concepts for analysing complex phenomena.

After reading this book you can better understand why drug policies seldom work and how market regulation can be rational.

Thinking in Systems is a much needed read for every knowledge worker, because it exposes the limits of human thinking. Fortunately the book also offers advice on how to mitigate the limits.

I'm giving this book five stars, because it is terse in the reasoning, inspiring in its tone and relevant to our time.",3
Hannah Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Systems and not an island,"Discussing a topic like systems is like trying to discuss databases or networks: you know what they are but do you really? Donella Meadows doesn't try to dumb things down but does write about systems and the complexity of systems that is not only completely relevant for any level of scholarship, it is easy to read. If you're getting bogged down by some of the ideas, go to the Appendix where there is a clear layout of what she discusses in the bulk of the book.

I'm reading this book for a PhD level coursework about the foundations of systems in the social sciences but really, this is for anyone who wants to gain perspective on how things work not as single phenomenon but how things are interconnected in such a way that you cannot take for granted even buying a cup of coffee in the morning. Additionally, this is a book for any type of discipline that requires seeing the interconnectivity of many different parts, whether it is engineering, math, information, public policy, etc...",1
Marco,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Required reading for humanity,"A beautiful and brilliant work that gifts us with a world view to aspire to. If I was king, this would be required being for all humanity. As Bill McKibben says, a classic. The first part of the book is the systems primer, and can be a bit of a slog for those unused to this discipline; the rest of the book is about how to apply systems thinking to a remarkably broad range of problems and issues. This book is as much a work of spirit as it is of science, and I keep it on the shelf between the Zen teachings and ecology texts. Get it; read it...more than once.",1
Chris A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Feedback about Feedback Loops,"Really this is a 4.5 rating (rounded up):
As a scientist trained in thinking about physiology, endocrinology, and other human integrated organ systems, the descriptions of system complexity, interaction, and positive vs negative feedback were very basic. However, the application of these concepts to business or service models helped me broaden my understanding about how I can apply what I know in science to what I can do in business or service delivery. It is indeed a 'Primer' and is very clearly written at a foundational level. Because it was not 'all new and revolutionary' it did not get all 5 stars, but I would easily give it 4.5 for making important concepts easy to understand, and for showing how these concepts apply to a variety of different systems in everyday life. (I wish politicians understood the idea of feedback loops.)",1
J. Perez,3.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Hard for the beginner to understand,"This is a good book, but the stock-and-flow mapping was difficult for me to grasp, as presented. I ended up doing a lot of research on my own, outside of this book, and discovered that causal maps are much easier to understand and interpret. I think she has a lot of good information, it just isn’t easy for the beginner in systems (and I was definitely a beginner).",2
Tony Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,As close as the real world gets to Hari Seldon,"Reading Thinking In Systems: A Primer it is often difficult to believe that it was largely written 20 years ago, though the use in a key chapter of quotes from papers in one month of 1992 makes it clear it was. Meadows prophesises almost the whole list of growing social inequities which it would take until 2011 for the Occupy movement to provide a popular response to. But that unparalleled predictive accuracy is not what really matters about this book. More importantly, it is a text which a suitably informed teacher should be able to build a first rate course around, as for most still stuck in reductionist silos, it might need some extended context to be fully appreciated.

For somebody like me who had taken on board emergence/systems/complexity even earlier than that, it asks the question as to why we haven't been able to nudge things in more constructive directions? And it provides much of the answer. There are many ways for systems to behave contrarily to the intentions and expectations of those tweaking the controls. Meadows explains those traps at a level anybody with an open mind should be able to learn from. Obvious parallels between biological and sociotechnical evolution obscure a vital difference in time scale: standard biological platforms required countless failed variants before they succeeded while the colonising language of social victors rushes all our eggs into unvalidated baskets.

Anybody else who has been struggling to find a workaround for the difficult path to systemic understanding identified in Marcia Salner's 1986 paper, should see Thinking in Systems as a potential circuit breaker which will enable systems thinking to be introduced much earlier than the half or more of a lifetime it has taken those of us who found it the hard way.

While the editor has done an admirable job of turning notes into a book without their author to turn to, it could never be quite as finished or as evenly paced as it might have been has Meadows lived to complete it herself. Yet this might even make it more valuable, if some good teachers can get to add their own layer of interpretation and context to the basic fundamentals it lays out so clearly.",1
Trevor Neal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,review of Thinking in Systems,"Seeking a primer on systems thinking, and learning that Donella Meadows co-wrote the classic, 'Limits to Growth,' I knew that I had to read, 'Thinking in Systems.' Mrs. Meadows has surpassed my expectations.

She begins with an introduction to systems, defining concepts such as feedback loops. She then discusses what makes a system resilient. She includes an analysis of how systems can surprise those who try to model them, making the prediction of systems behavior challenging. She concludes with ways to solve systems problems.

A must have book for anyone seeking alternatives to the reductionistic tendencies of many current scientific theories, 'Thinking in Systems,' should be required reading for policy makers, social and natural scientists, as well as engineers.",1
Philip J. Salem,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,A terrific second systems book,"A wonderful presentation of ideas, feelings, and experiences. What passes for ""systems theory"" these days has changed from its original set of applications. Too often, scholars, analysts, and practioners have used systems thinking to justify an idea retrospectively rather than as a tool to learn from the past and guide some limited future action. What the early systems thinkers wrote about became tools for thinking rigidly. Meadows knew all about these traps, and she does a great job of explaining the limits as well as the advantages of systems thinking. My guess is that those who are completely unfamiar with this approach will find some of the first chapters confusing. Systems thinking is interdisciplinary thinking, but most of us learn about it within a discipline. My advice is to learn about systems ideas within your field of interest first, then rush to buy this book.",1
Aaron U. Bolin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Great general overview of concepts,"Donella Meadows is a genius. Rather, she was a genius; she passed away before this little gem of a book was published. I didn't know her or her work personally, so it is probably more conservative to only comment on this one little book --- which I thought was brilliant.

Meadows delivers exactly what she promised: a primer on systems thinking. She digs deep enough and provides wide enough coverage to provide a strong grounding in the topic with a style that should be understandable for most readers. Where it is important, Meadows provides an adequate treatment of the nuts and bolts in a non-technical and enjoyable to read narration.

Although hardcore systems modelers and programmers might find this primer simplistic, I found the simple explanations, integrated delivery, and concise package beautiful. I've read through some of the highly technical volumes about systems dynamics models, but I've not come across a book on the topic that packs more pound-for-pound punch than Thinking in Systems. My copy is riddled with marginal notes throughout, because Donella Meadows really made me think. No, she really made me understand. If you have even a passing interest in systems dynamics, this is a good place to start.",1
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,too generic and moralizing,"Unfortunately, i have not learned a lot about systems from this book. It's mostly about common sense and opinion sharing. It contains a lot of moralizing. I mostly agree with her opinions and moral judgements, but it's neither a preach nor a newspaper. I expected something more specific, more scientific, some reasoning tools for dealing with systems. I have not found that.",1
Edward Heidicker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Seeing the world differently,"There's a great paradox in this work. On the one hand we are systems within systems and while understanding that or viewing the world that way doesn't give us the predictability that so many people wish they had. Is it any wonder as our systems become more and more complex we are (1) at a loss to control the world and (2) are susceptible to those who act as if they know what the problems are and how to fix them.

For me this book was more of in invitation to not only observe but also to not be too overconfident where knowing trumps not knowing. Tread lightly.",1
christina,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Design Thinking & Problem Solving 101,"Since reading this book I can honestly say I've been thinking in systems for all aspects of my work and life. I think this is such an important read not just for you education or professional development, but also personal growth. Especially for designers who want to ""design think"" and aspire to be the next Cooper and Tim Browns, I really recommend this book.",1
Matthew T. Aaron,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Helps put human beings into persepctive,"I am not an engineer and had never given systems theory much thought until I stumbled across this book.

The most important takeaway for me was the difference between parameter and system changes. A parameter change would be a variable like minimum wage or taxes. Politicians spend tons of time and money on these issues. But in the end, this rarely changes behavior and the national economy; rich people still find a way to pay less taxes.

To change a system, you have to make drastic moves (i.e: Fair Tax) that radically alter the functions of the system to alter behavior.

Also of note was the importance roles versus people: People are more alike than we think, it is more their role/job functions that determines their behavior.

I highly recommend this book - it will improve the objectivity of your analysis and decisions, well worth the few dollars you paid.",2
MGM_FD,4.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,"Must read for leaders and future leaders, especially the ones who know everything.","A great entry to systems theory, with real world relevance. There is a degree of scientific theory at the beginning, but it provides the reader with the foundation to grasp the solid insights further into the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to impact their environment, whether personal, occupational, society or world, but would like more insight than the rhetoric, punditry, or latest fad.",1
Fab,4.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Good overview of system thinking,Good overview of Systems Theory with many practical and clear examples. The message is very clear: focus on the whole picture to understand the particular behaviour. Observe and identify the boundaries and the interconnections between systems before taking decision and judgement. System thinking helps you to understand the complexity but not to forecast the unforecastable.,1
Oliver,4.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Read it twice,"Got much more from it on the second read. First time for technical concepts and second time for the context of their application. The context makes so much more sense the second time through. Despite the age of this text, the principles are still timely and applicable in the 21st century.",1
Pravin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,The Clearest and Most Accessible Presentation on Systems,"This is the BEST book on Systems Thinking I have read so far. My hats off to Donella Meadows for making the principles and truths about the functioning of systems so easily accessible to us by looking at common day-to-day systems that we see or participate in, in light of these principles. The book is such an easy read! We recognize the principles and realize that we have intuitively known and seen them in action all along and even learnt most of them formally only to forget them eventually. Yet, there is a freshness in relearning them with Donella as our guide. We actually learn when and how to apply these principles and understand systems that we participate in or are of interest to us very deeply. The simplicity in which they are presented by Donella speaks volumes of her deep understanding, knowledge, greatness and humility.

I have read other books on the same subject where I had to throw down the books in disgust as one author wrote copious paragraphs on why he should be recognized as the father of systems thinking and rest of the book was pretty much unreadable, and another author tried very hard to be clever and make the topic very intriguing and thought provoking but was nowhere close to it except in his own mind.

Thanks Dana! I am going to read this book several times over. It is life changing. And, I truly mean it.",6

Travis Emmett,3.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,A interesting book on systems and worldviews,"Overview:
Thinking in Systems: A Primer is exactly as the title suggests. Though this book will help give the reader an overview of systems, it is only a primer. This book is good for a beginner in systems thinking, looking for an overview of the basic parts, implications, and workings of systems. Meadows has the ability to take the reader to a level where one can see how systems work in this world as a whole. At the same time, Meadows is detailed enough to show how an everyday system, such as a thermostat, works in detail.
Problems:
Though Thinking in Systems is a primer to systems thinking in general, the book contains more than that, it contains Meadows world view. Any future reader should be prepared to witness Meadows directly, or indirectly presenting her far left worldview throughout the book. Issues such involving the economy, population control, global warming, religion, and evolution are brought into the book, and held have primary examples for systems. In spite of this fact, there is much that the reader can learn about systems.
Benefits:
Though Thinking in Systems may not be the best textbook, and does contain strong personal views, there is still much that can be learned about systems thinking. For anyone looking for a book to read that provides general information about how systems function, their role and influence on this world, and how to use them to ones benefit, this book is recommended.
For academic purposes:
This book is made up of a compilation of Meadow’s personal unpublished notes, which makes the book follow a somewhat unsystematic order. Thinking in Systems brings covers a wide range of topics such as, global warming population control, religion, evolution, and the economy and could be more useful as a book for ethics, rather than systems. Though is book would make a good required reading for a class setting, it is not advised for a main textbook.
Structure:
This book is divided into three parts: 1. System structure and Behavior, 2. Systems and Us, and 3. Creating Change- in Systems and in our Philosophy. Part one deals with the basics of what systems are and how they function, part two discusses how systems work in the world around us, and part three talks about how we can leverage systems to create change.",1
KP,2.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,This leads me to believe the book could’ve been updated to give readers a better understanding of the information she tried to c,"This book introduces readers how to do exactly that of which the title says, Thinking in Systems, by offering insight on how to deal with the dynamics of complex systems that surrounds us every day. The dynamics can range from political and economical systems on international levels down to the simplistic daily household chores we do, all of which have a systematic approach to. Due to the unexpected passing of Donella (Dana) Meadows eight years after completing the draft of Thinking In Systems, the book was never finished. This leads me to believe the book could’ve been updated to give readers a better understanding of the information she tried to convey.
Part one of the book is all about system structure and behavior and goes from the basics into the next chapter about systems zoo. According to Dana, “a system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something.” This simplistic enough start to chapter one of the book goes on to describe the different elements that complete the different systems such as your digestive system, football teams, schools and so on. Once you are able to recognize the elements to those systems you must look for the interconnections that operate through the flow of information that holds the elements together.
Part two is titled Systems and Us and goes on to describe why systems work so well and why they surprise us. Resilience, self-organization, hierarchy, and suboptimization are all part of why the systems work so well while unforeseen patterns of behavior, linear and nonlinear relationships are a few reasons why systems can surprise us. Because a lot of relationships in systems are nonlinear, “their relative strengths shift in disproportionate amounts as the stocks in the system shift.” This creates instability as discussed in the spruce budworm example, which is also considered a surprise, something that is common in most systems.
Systems Traps and Opportunities is a very long chapter that describes how systems are structured in ways that produce problematic behavior known as archetypes, which according to Dana Meadows can cause a lot of trouble. There are plenty of examples given in the form of a trap that has a way out attached to it. These include Policy Resistance, Tragedy of the Commons, Drift to Low Performance, Escalation, Success to the Successful, Shifting to the Burden to the Intervenor, Rule Beating, and lastly; Seeking the Wrong Goal. As confusing as they sound, I liked the way it was laid out in gray boxes in the book to easily reference back to see where each trap with the way out is located. I was really unsure about the rule beating trap because it pointed out how “departments of governments, universities, and corporations often engage in pointless spending at the end of the fiscal year just to get rid of money.” This is something I wasn’t aware of and wondered how that affects the national deficit. The way out of that trap is to create rules that achieve the purpose of the rules instead of beating them but I do not know how that would be applied to pointless spending since they will be penalized the following year with less money allocated to their budget. It’s a confusing cycle that I would have to do more research on to answer all the questions I have about it.
The rest of the book discusses points on places to intervene in a system and living in a world of systems which basically summarizes the concepts and practice the most general “systems wisdoms”.
My thoughts on this book were that it was quite a difficult read and I found myself going over and over and over the same sentences and paragraphs multiple times in order to get a grasp on what the author was trying to convey. I wondered the whole time how this applies to sustainable development and found it difficult to relate this to my level of sustainability. As I stated in my introduction, I believe that if Dana Meadows had been able to complete the book and not just the draft, maybe things would have been different. My reasoning behind this is I think that some of the content is very outdated and perhaps a more modern version is what is needed. Aside from that, I am not a systems thinker and probably the real reason I found it to be such a difficult read. I would not recommend this book to be read by anyone outside MIT or other technical schools/programs.",1
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,"Why, why, why.... this book can give you some answers.","Great book.

jambi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,I want everyone to read this book!,"I'm a systems thinker by nature, and this book is excellent. She first gives a broad description of what a system is and uses several examples so you can see the familiar pattern everywhere. I especially liked her analysis of leverage points and problem behaviors. It is hard to believe this was written in the 90's, her examples have modern day relevance, sadly in part do to our failure to recognize/change the given system(s). Excellent, excellent book! :)",4

zeroKelvin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Thoughts on 'Thinking in Systems',"I found this book really helpful in providing a language for communicating about systems. We all interact with systems on a daily, moment-by-moment basis, and it can be difficult to find ways to describe the many patterns that are consistent across our experiences with systems, like self-reinforcing feedback loops and the collective balance required to combat entropy in maintaining systems. Once you begin thinking in systems and using the language of systems the world can be a much more ordered and manageable place to navigate, as so much of what allows us as lifeforms to maintain ourselves over time comes from patterned consistencies that are systematic in origin. Solar-system, ecosystem, nervous-system, we are the result of systems, the observers of systems and the creators of systems, and this book is a good place to learn to see and communicate in systems.",2

Carlos A. Accioly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Be prepared to expand your mind,"It's hard to explain how much this book can expand your mind if you only allow it to.

The author explains and shows with incredibly diverse examples how systems thinking can give you a whole new perspective on how the world functions. In the end, however, she cautions you against believing that your new-found knowledge can give you superpowers to bend reality to your will. Her message is humbling: you leave with a renewed realization of the world's complexity, the structure of which we can glimpse and appreciate, but begin to think you know everything and that complexity will smack the back of your head when you're not looking.

In the end your takeaway can be the ability to look at the world with the wonder of a newborn; at the same time you suffer a loss of innocence when you realize how hard it is to prevent bad things from happening.

Greatly expanding your mind, while making sure you understand that it is not the end, but the beginning of a journey towards understanding the world. What more can you expect from a book?",3
Gonzalez,3.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Good book to ponder about systems,"I only enjoyed reading this book because it was very clear and well written. However, I could only recommend this to people who have little or no background in science and mathematics. The reason is because about half the book is just a big discussion on differential equations. Most people are trained in physics and mathematics will already be familiar with dealing with systems. For example, a slinky reacts to an external force by moving; it is just Newton's law expressed differently. An other example is Newton's Law of Cooling.

So, if you are a young student who is just now learning classical mechanics and/or calculus, or just a someone who is unfamiliar with mathematics, I recommend reading this book to start you on your journey on modeling systems. But don't stop at this book or use it to take the place of learning mathematics, just use this book as a complementary book to explain what those messy equations and graphs represent.",2
Matthew R. Abts,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,READ THIS BOOK,"Are you a human? Are you a non-human entity that would describe yourself as a humanist or a student of human thought? BUY THIS BOOK.

I've never really thought of myself as a ""systems"" person or much interested in the philosophy of human society, and this is a book that tackles both. I read it after a friend practically beat my head in with a copy. ""Fine, fine,"" I said, ""I'll read the book!""

So I read it. And it has changed the way I look at the world around me.

It's also a good, fun, entertaining read that shows you what it is trying to say by using examples. It doesn't get bogged down in theory, but by the time you're done, you'll understand the theory that other more didactic books would put you to sleep trying to teach.

There's no way to quite describe how broad an appeal this book should have. You're probably a person reading this, right? BUY THIS BOOK.",2

Michael A. Bell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,insightful description of systems principles,"This book provided a wonderful complement to analytical and mathematical/symbolic methods of analysis, and filled a number of gaps in understanding diverse processes/fields. The material is presented in a very accessible yet thoughtful fashion. Ms. Meadows has a gift for cutting through intellectual clutter to express profound ideas. While I did not ""hang on every word"" (there were some views I could not agree with), I nonetheless can heartily recommend this book to anyone who craves a better understanding of the difficult dynamics confronting the modern world. The material is well organized, and conveniently summarized in the rear portion of the book.",2
John K. McIlwain,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,"It's just what it says it is, a primer","I'm not a systems expert so I found this very useful and comprehensive. I especially appreciated her humbleness and frankness as she noted that this is just a model of life, not life itself, and that it is a lot easier to model a system than change it. Also, the fact that all systems are interconnected means that where you draw the boundaries is arbitrary. The more she spoke about systems, the more Buddhist systems theory became, but I'm not sure that was her intention. It is just that the teachings of the Buddha on interconnectedness seem to be at the heart of systems theory. Very glad I bought it.",3
kaufflin,4.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Pleasantly Surprised,"I agree with many of the reviews that this book was very hard to get into. The writing is rather dry and I couldn't really get into the diagrams. I was required to read this book for a class and I really struggled to get interested (which is why I started looking for reviews/summaries in the first place!). I also agree with some of the reviews that many of the points she makes seem pretty obvious.

However, the further I got into the book, the more interested I became. She has excellent real-life examples that I honestly wasn't expecting based on the start of the book. Though I thought some of the beginning portions were obvious I appreciated the simple to complex build up. I don't think I would have enjoyed/understood the ending as much had I skimmed the beginning. I had a hard time putting it down during the last few chapters and an even harder time not regaling my friends with her insights when I finished! Also, important to note that this book is Thinking in Systems: A PRIMER. So in reality, readers should be expecting some ""obvious"" points.

Overall, I STRONGLY recommend this book. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is so hard to get into. BUT TRY, I promise it's worth it!",9
T Anderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Perfect Introduction,"This little book zeros in on Systems Thinking and provides the reader with all the information they need to get started down the road of commonsense.

It covers stock and flow diagrams in detail. The author's style of teaching and writing make the reading very easy. She uses examples that are really easy to relate to.

This book will make you start looking at everything as a stock, flow, or feedback loop.

The samples are intended to be built in Stella/iThink and there is an appendix that has all the formulas in it. The thinking in systems web site says they are developing the models for download. In the meantime, you can build them all pretty quickly using the formulas provided.

If you have no Systems Thinking experience, this book is a perfect introduction that should be read before reading a book like Software Process Dynamics.

I recommend this book to anyone that wants a little more logic in their thought life. I really does put a new perspective on things.",4
Mark P. McDonald,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,This is the place to start to understand systems thinking.,"Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows is the perfect primer for people who want to learn more about system thinking. The book is clear, provides multiple examples and clear diagrams/illustrations to help people understand what systems are, how they work, and how you can use systems thinking to understand and manage complexity.

I have read other systems thinking books by people like Peter Checkland and they are good but this book is better to introduce people to the principles of systems thinking. The book does more than just discuss systems but also systems traps and how to intervene to change systems.

I highly recommend this book to people who want to understand systems thinking, documentation and management. If you are someone who knows system thinking and want to teach others, then start with this book.",2
Daniel MMM,3.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Readable but not engaging,"The reading is definitely not engaging. Boring at times. It is not ""fun-to-read"" as the back cover states. Also, it is very superficial. I'd say it is a ""superficial primer"".

A while ago I realized that the truly brilliant people were not the ones that dazzled with complex thoughts. but those can communicate complex concepts in a conversational manner. In that, Donella Meadows was truly brilliant. The book is an excellent starting point for systems thinking. The chapter Leverage Points in a System is a paradigm changer. Her book LImits to Growth is a tour de force on sustainability - written in 1972 (and updated every 10-20 years) it's scary relevant. Read anything and everything she wrote or was involved in.",2

Mutt,4.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,"Required reading, with caveat","In the first two chapters of Thinking in Systems, Donella Meadows lays bare the entire scope of what systems are and how they function.

I started becoming wary of Ms Meadows' approach in subsequent chapters where she begins to offer ""solutions"" to system ""problems."" I, for one, have never been a fan of the forced redistribution of wealth, but it is offered here as a recommended fix to balance wealth. Donella's basic argument here is that imbalance is bad, which is a ridiculous assumption. But it's at the heart of the whole socialism vs free-market capitalism argument, into which Donella sides with the former and I side with the latter. Your opinion may vary.

I would recommend parts of this book to anyone as a first read on the subject - it will clarify a lot about system dynamics, and clarity is a rare gem when it comes to this topic. I cannot, however, recommend this book in good conscience without offering a caveat about Donella's problematic injection of her socialist philosophies. Read with a healthy dose of empirical skepticism.",7

I recommend this book only for the part of systems theory, and keep in mind that when she is talking about politics and environmentalism that she comes from an erred philosophical base and you have to recognize that as she uses system theory to support communist or environmental ideas. Her basic error is to view the ""good of the whole"", but the error is that there is no good of the whole - just good of an individual (because good applies to living entities and a sum of individuals do not create a new entity). This is the communist belief of a higher organism in which individuals must sacrifice to.

Carolyn Thornlow,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,THE handbook for living,"In a nutshell, this book is about systems. So much more than this, it is a journey into the meta-rules of how the universe and everything in it comes and ""plays"" together. There is one thing to be understood that applies to physiology, businesses, economies, plants and puppies alike. Everything is a system. And all systems have behaviors and rules. As Donella Meadows writes: ""The trick...is to recognize what structures contain which latent behaviors, and what conditions release those behaviors -- and where possible to arrange the structures and conditions to reduce the probability of destructive behaviors and to encourage the possibility of beneficial ones.""

Grasping ""the whole universe"" is certainly a momumental task. The book brilliantly presents concepts in very graspable units. She starts with picturing what a system is -- a stock with inflows and outflows that affect its stability and all of which are further affected by feedback loops and delays.

So armed with this model, individuals may be better guided in their decisions and actions as it becomes clear that actions can beget other actions and reactions (or unintended consequences.) But there is even more complexity. For instance, policies are a way to control the stocks and flows within a system. However, one of several behavior archetypes is policy resistance which comes from the bounded rationality of the actors within a system, each with his or her own goal. Meadows takes the reader on a deep and thought-provoking journey through all the behavior archetypes of systems. The result is an empowering ""forewarned is forearmed"" knowledge.

That is the ultimate goal of this book. When people affect positive change in the world -- and it just may be everyone's duty to do that -- it is through smart and correct controls on a system. Ms. Meadows then gives the knowledge to do this. She lays out the leverage points in any system -- the opportunities for making things right or better. The coda is a legacy of thoughts to live by, the last and perhaps most important of which is ""Don't Erode the Goal of Goodness.""

With such profound applicability, this book is the handbook for living. Everyone on the planet should read it.",105
tom,1.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,It's a waste of time and money,I read about half way and just couldn't stand how little or no value it provided. The author paraphrased the same thing over and over again. I found nothing enlightening about it.,1

That did not surprise me or disappoint me as much as the very obvious slant toward a liberal agenda evident in all of the 'examples' provided. Several examples of systems were stated as fact that are, at this time, merely theories. I found this to be a huge distraction from the message that the book could provide. I skimmed the second half of the book just trying to get through it.

F. Mullen,2.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Freshman Initiation,"In her ""Note from the Editor,"" Diana Wright advises the reader that the manuscript for ""Thinking in Systems"" went unpublished for eight years before Dana Meadows' unfortunate death. Perhaps there was a reason for that: perhaps Dana Meadows recognized that the manuscript was not ready for publication. For the text is uncertain whether it is an introduction to systems analysis as a scientific endeavor, a tableau of counter-intuitive results ""explained"" by ""systems thinking"", or a pseudo-analytic basis for the usual policy preferences of the political left. In its raw form, it is a mish-mash of these and other incomplete themes, so by the end you're not sure what the point was.

Were it an introductory text in systems analysis for freshman students of English literature, the first four chapters might be ok. Meadows introduces the notions of stocks, inputs, and outputs in a way that could persuade a non-technical reader that systems analysis was a quantitative science and that the relevant quantities might be computed so long as students from another department were available. She also introduces the notion of feedback and discusses the qualitatively different forms of output resulting from positive or negative feedback. She even discusses the effects on the output of varying feedback delay. This may be about as far as you can go without introducing any math, and as Meadows did not introduce any math, this also might have been a good place to stop.

But sadly, the editors chose to publish what came next. Next was chapter 5, ""Systems Traps...and Opportunities."" Here we find discussions of a variety of very complicated systems--Romanian and Swedish abortion policy, for example--whose analysis is beyond most humans, let alone freshman literature students. From these discussions Meadows derives generalized ""systems traps"" and ""ways out"".

Her first trap, for example, is called ""policy resistance"": ""When various actors try to pull a system stock toward various goals, ...[it] just pulls the stock farther from the goals of the other actors and produces additional resistance...."" Translation: people disagree. And here's the ""way out"": ""Let go. Bring in all the actors and use the energy formerly expended on resistance to seek out mutually satisfactory ways for all goals to be realized...."" Translation: can't we all just get along. And so on. The ""traps"" and ""ways out"" are of a nature so obtuse as to defy any sort of concrete analysis, and as insights they are the sort that cease to seem profound after sophomore year.

And it gets worse. Chapter 6, ""Leverage Points--Places to Intervene in a System,"" might have been a good place to discuss system sensitivity analysis--in a qualitative way, of course--but instead it leans heavily toward the justification of pet liberal causes like environmentalism, government regulation of industry (""The power of big industry calls for the power of big government...; a global economy makes global regulations necessary""), and high taxes on anyone with more wealth than a Dartmouth professor. Chapter 7, ""Living in a World of Systems,"" sets new standards for sentimental whole-earthism, recommending, on the strength of ""the tool of systems thinking,"" that the future be ""brought lovingly into being,"" that we learn to ""dance with great powers"" as the Eskimo ""have turned snow into ... a system with which they can dance."" Be caring, be good: these are the final admonishments before the book, thankfully, ends.

In addition, there is economic illiteracy displayed throughout, as for example this, which follows an inept discussion of Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"": ""Economic theory as derived from Adam Smith assumes first that 'homo economicus' acts with perfect optimality on complete information, and second that when many of the species 'homo economicus' do that, their actions add up to the best possible outcome for everybody."" This is utter nonsense. Smith says nothing about perfection of optimality nor completeness of information. He merely observes that, in the aggregate, a collection of humans seeking their individual interests often advances the economic welfare of society as a whole. And he certainly does not assert that everybody will arrive at ""the best possible outcome."" The ""invisible hand"" operates even in the presence of individual failure and distress, and in some ways because of them.

Winding up for the conclusion, Meadows admits that ""[s]ystems thinking has taught me to trust my intuition more and my figuring-out rationality less...."" If you've gotten this far in the book, you will certainly agree, for in writing it she gave intuition free rein while rationality was on the Costa del Sol. If you're a student of Dana Meadows, this book will give you considerable insight into her intuition and her prejudices. If you are simply interested in some qualitative discussion of systems, there are some not-bad introductory bits in the first four chapters. But if you're going to buy just one book on systems analysis, buy a different one.",165

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Future Crimes: Inside the Digital Underground and the Battle for Our Connected World,Essential Reading,"Marc Goodman's book is essential reading for anyone getting lost in the feel good world of technology utopia. From the cynical profiteering of the social media and network giants like Facebook and Google to the vast empire of cyber criminals. This book exposes that this is cyberspace today, not some tomorrow. Two major points I take from this book are that few are transforming the world for the good of humankind, but for profit, and perhaps more importantly and disturbingly, these same people are not building or even thinking of creating high level security systems to protect against hacking by any number of intruders. Mr Goodman points out that the more we integrate into the internet of things, that the security of our technological systems is determined by the weakest link in that system. This is profoundly unsettling and so it should be. This is not to say that we are entering a wonderful period of advancement, but to point out the dangerously absent integration of high security systems into any and all technology should be a necessary part of the development of such products and services. This book should be discussed far and wide on Futurist media.",3
Andrew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Future Crimes: Inside the Digital Underground and the Battle for Our Connected World,"Eye-opening review of digital vulnerabilities, past, present, and future, with practical advice and a dash of humor.","I've known Marc Goodman since 2010 and have had the pleasure of seeing this book evolve from concept to coffee table. Marc's in person presentations are dynamic, funny, eye-opening and sometimes downright creepy. Marc's character shines through in this book. It's an encyclopedic cataloguing of threats and vulnerabilities in the digital age, past, present, and future. It's shocking how vulnerable we all are and how simple it is for anyone with intent to gain access and cause harm. Marc's not a pessimist, however, even with his long experience in law enforcement, just a realist. By sharing some stories, his experience, and some practical security tips, he's doing what he can to help people recognize and minimize their personal or organizational risk. It's a book that's well worth the price just as a reference. And if the advice is taken to decrease your digital risk, it could pay out a sizable dividend. Highly recommended.",4
Phillip Skaga,5.0 out of 5 stars,Future Crimes: Inside the Digital Underground and the Battle for Our Connected World,“Sobering Reality”,"Technological change has always been a powerful force in human society particularly in the USA and especially recent decades. Most tech changes created new problems e.g. smog from cars, but eventually these were either mitigated or we learned to live with attendant problems. It is not inaccurate to consider what is presently happening in technology as almost miraculous. Problems engendered by present collective ‘miracles’ are increasingly of a different order than in past.

There is some indication the present spate of tech innovations has/will have a impact on society greater in magnitude (transnational) and nature (unusually invasive). It is difficult to discover potential detail of these pending problems from current news sources or from technologists themselves. Present tech hype has a propensity to excessively, perhaps understandably, focussed on good news (among technologists) as found in popular media (generally anxiously repeating good news). Less emphasis is placed on impediments or dangers. One need only consider Kurzweil, Diamandis, the Singularity University, TED, Gore, Edge, Brockman or query entrepreneurs that created Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. as to articulation of adverse influences.

Marc Goodman therefore offers refreshing, and frightening, consideration of what we face and whether it will be more, on balance, to our advantage as humans or less. Evgeny Morosov, for example, preceded Goodman as a critical observer with qualified optimism in his books “To Save Everything Click Here” and “The Net Delusion”. I consider Morozov to be fairly circumspect in his criticisms though thorough evaluating each issue in countries such as Nicaragua and Iran, and how governed and governors discovered tech tools to be double edged swords.
Goodman’s critical view is more focused than Morozov. There are many other critics such as Gordon at Northwestern University emphatic about worries (in his case the US economy and employment), Postman who writes with more fervor and broadly, or Oxford University whose detailed analysis concluded almost half of 700 US job categories are likely to suffer serious unemployment in near future. As I recall semi-truck drivers were among those threatened. Recent (2015) notice of driverless semis (Mercedes Benz) testing in Nevada was in the news only a couple years after the Oxford study.

UAVs, the internet, bioengineering, nano technology, cell phones, quantum computing, robots, internet of things, artificial body parts, 3D printing, suborbital flight, iPADs, laptops, mass storage, national infrastructure and more are subject to consideration in “Future Crimes”.

Goodman is an ex-Los Angeles policeman so his views possess a law enforcement perspective. Subsequently his credentialed authority has been expanded through security consulting with a broad range of private and government clients in the USA and abroad. This additional experience has led him to conclude we should prepare ourselves for some very bad near future experiences with tech tools and toys.
Ten million credit records stolen from Target, 4+ million personnel records for federal government employees compromised, and millions of NSA records taken by Snowden collectively presage an iceberg of threat to personal and nation state security. Each of these examples serve to illustrate how much money can be stolen, how many private lives can be compromised, and how difficult it is to identify bad guys in the story.

Goodman concisely, if not exhaustively, goes through experiences with individual forms of tech tools evaluating present and posing future threats. His analysis would be devastating if only for volume of data compromised. In other words, and this is an editorial comment, our current tech changes have thoroughly blinded us to threatening downsides from more than one direction. Theft of secure data is one aspect of threat and perhaps the least significant. UAVs appearing everywhere in our skies may constitute collective and dangerous multiple repeats of a 9/11 character. Actually anyone can place a few pounds of C-4 on a $3,000 UAV and fly it into the White House under FAA radar. An example along with bioengineered deadly organisms, robotic threats to human beings, as well as probable concatenation of these and other evolving technological wonders.

All of these evolving tech threats are made much worse by popular lack of attention and governmental misdirection of influencing legislation. General popular and governmental indifferent acceptance multiply dangers faced from our technological enthusiasm. (One need only read a history of ACA computer programming development under Jean Sibelius to understand an awful example of governmental ineptitude. For which see Steve Brill’s book “Bitter Pill”.) The last two of Goodman’s chapters consider these aspects of threat in some detail and they may be a punchline for the book. A sample summary is “The exponential nature of technology and the linear response of government mean we will need many more hands on deck to help build a safe and stable society that won’t destroy itself.” Or “The tens of thousands of attacks successfully perpetrated against Washington by foreign adversaries prove the U.S. government can’t even protect itself.”",2

If you are in the security business, most will be common knowledge. If not, these pages provide a good overview. I can summarize by saying: everything can be hacked; everything will be hacked. The challenge of this part of the book is that some of the vulnerabilities have been patched and others have appeared. I enjoyed the last two chapters, which provide some possible ""ways out"" for security risks.

Ron Immink,5.0 out of 5 stars,Future Crimes: Inside the Digital Underground and the Battle for Our Connected World,Cyber security is a hotspot,"What is humanities back up plan?

Future Crimes by Marc Goodman is a very scary book. We have covered some books that touch on the topic before such as “Filter Bubble”, “Overconnected” and “Brandwashed”, but “Future Crimes, a journey to the dark side of technology and how to survive it” is an eye opener.

The scary statistics

Lets start with some scary statistics:

200,000 new pieces of malware are identified every day
One third of all households in the USA are infected by malicious software
95% of all malware is not detected by most virus checkers (those include McAfee and Symantec)
A hacking intrusion takes 210 days to detect
75% of the time your defences can be penetrated in minutes
Only 15% require more then a few hours (but are still hacked)
The average cost per record stolen is $ 188
In 2017 a 100 billion will be spend on software and hardware security
110 million accounts were stolen from Target stores alone
The value of location data will be over a 100 billion in the next ten years
Android was created to give Google access to all your mobile data
Data brokers earn 156 billion every year
Acxiom has over 700 million consumer profiles worldwide
Experian sold the data on 2/3 of the USA population to a organised crime group in Vietnam
13.1 million Americans are victim of identity theft annually. 500,000 of them are children, costing $ 21 billion in 2012
600,000 accounts on Facebook are compromised every day
25% of all reviews on Yelp are bogus
11.2% of Facebook accounts are fake
25% of all credit reports contain errors
100 million phishing messages are send every day
Organised crime is 15-20% of global GDP
80% of all hackers are now working or organised crime
Kickstarter was hacked
Everything is data

You can see where this is going. This is all about data. Google and Facebook are free because they are data collectors and aggregators. Google is worth 400 billion and the value of every long term profile on Facebook is worth 81 dollars. Both have hundreds of petabytes on their users (both don’t use the word customers…. this should make you thinks). They know everything you have done online and increasingly everything else. Imagine if Facebook was there since 1950. Anything in your past you don’t want anyone to know?

No privacy

In the USA online data that is collected by third parties are not considered private. Which means it can be used by Revenue, the police or the divorce lawyer of your ex. The Stasi could only tap 40 phones nationwide at their peak. Now Orwell’s 1984 is here and it is called Google, Facebook or Watson. You probably have something to hide, you just don’t know it yet.

All that date is stored and hacker can get access to that data. Any data that is collected will invariably leak.

Do no evil?

Yes, the crooks are not only the criminals:

41% of all cyber attacks are from China
The NSA is listening
Google used the street view cars for more then taking pictures
Google was fined $22.5 million for illegally circumventing privacy settings
When you fill in your online profile for OKcupid, that data is immediately shared with over 5o0 data brokers. Check your match.com terms and conditions
Facebook has conducted social experiments without permission and keep your data even after you have de-activated the account.
Every time you update, the privacy settings go back to standards setting, which basically gives full access
The average person will encounter 1,462 privacy policies every year, with an average length of 2,518 words
PayPal’s privacy policy is longer then Shakespeare’s Hamlet
Google Drive’s privacy settings will give Google the rights to all your content and IP (If JK Rowling had written Harry Potter on Google Docs, she would have granted Google the worldwide rights)
Think of what can be done. Google has access to your calendar, your maps, your contacts, your documents, your pictures, voice, phone, the apps you use on your android, your translations, the videos you watch on Youtube, the conversations you have on Skype, your Nest, your camera, your eyes (Google glasses), your wallet. Look at the companies they are buying (robots, cameras, sensors, drones, AI). Here is the list.

You are their inventory. They better mean their slogan…… because if not….....

Your eyeballs can be hacked too

That is just on the data side. They can also hack your screen. Which means that you should not always belief what you see. Your phone screen might be controlled by somebody else. The CT scanner in the hospital can be manipulated. Your computer screen can be manipulated. Your GPRS screen can be manipulated. Virtual reality can be manipulated. Facebook has already manipulated you and Google can change your filter bubble with the flick of a switch (or algorithm).

Everything can be hacked

Everything that is connected can be hacked. And now we are at the beginning of the internet of things. Connecting everything. Which means that nothing can be hidden and everything can be hacked. Software and hardware. There are hardware viruses in chargers that allow to hack your phone. They found hidden wifi cards in kitchen equipment that could hack your wifi (and then the rest). You car can be hacked. Your pacemaker. Your hearing aid. Your headset. Your toys. Your lamp or your lightbulb (it is called Conversnitch). Your TV or Skype camera (they are watching you). Your coffee pot. Your burglar alarm. Your electronic locks. Your fridge. Your wearables. Google’s NEST has been hacked.

70% of all IoT devices have 25 unique security flaws.

If you are in business

Photocopiers can be hacked and I bet you didn’t know that photocopiers also have an internal hard disk where all copies are stored. Amazing what you can find on copiers that have been thrown away. Your printer can be hacked. The video conference system in your board room can be hacked.

If you are in government

Your infrastructure (energy, roads, water, broadband) can be hacked. Your databases (passports, police, medical, revenue) can be hacked. Your satellites can be hacked. In fact criminals are already launching their own mini satellites themselves.

The future of hacking

Robots can be hacked. Your servant robot will be sharpening the knife, while you are asleep, watching you. Your augmented body parts can be hacked. Your biometrics can be hacked. Facial recognition algorithms can be hacked. Facebook has the largest depository of biometric data on earth. They can be hacked. Keystroke recognition software can be hacked (Coursera uses keystroke recognition as a tool to identify users). Augmented reality can be hacked. Drones can be hacked. Your 3D and 4D printer can be hacked. Algorithms can be hacked. Now combine that with AI and the exponential curve. Watson as the new Al Capone or Don Watson.

Brain, DNA, Quantum, IoB, nano

Consider.......

Consider the development in brain computing interface (look up Emotiv and NeuroSky). IBM thinks that mind reading is no longer science fiction. Criminals soon can hack your brain.

Consider the development in DNA sequencing and synthetic biology. Your cells can be hacked. The DNA database probably already has been hacked. Combine that with bio printers and you have.

Consider the development of quantum computers, which will making hacking easier.

Consider the development of not only the Internet of Things but the network of microbes or the internet of biological things.

Consider the developments in nano technology. Nano bots can be hacked too.

Combine these development together and through exponentially on top of it and you have a potent mix for criminal armageddon or an exponential version of 1984.

Tips

At the end of the book he does give a number of tips on how to help you to protects yourself and they are very obvious:

Update regularly
Use sophisticated and different passwords
Know where you are downloading from
Watch your administrator settings
Turn off your computer when you are not using it
Encrypt
Think before you share
The above avoids 85% of all threats.

New words

The indication of a good books is the number of new words I learned:

Hacktivist (activist using hacking as a tool)
Crime singularity
Dataveilance (surveillance using data)
Sock puppetry (creating fake profiles)
Swatting (GPRS manipulation)
Flash rob (coordinated robbery by hackers)
CaaS (Crime as a Service)
Bluesnarfing (hacking your bluetooth to get access to your data)
Drone-versiting (drones as an advertising medium)
Narco drones (drones smuggling and transporting drugs)
Chemputer (printing medicine (or drugs))
Algorithmic criminal justice (using algorithms to determine infractions of the law)
DNA stalkers (hackers stalking your DNA)
DNA hard drive (four grams of DNA can store one year of digital data created by humankind)
Shodan (the criminal version of Google)

Mal Warwick,5.0 out of 5 stars,Future Crimes: Inside the Digital Underground and the Battle for Our Connected World,The scariest book I've read in years,"Future Crimes is the scariest book I’ve read in years.

You’re almost certainly reading this review on a device powered by microprocessors. Do you know who’s looking over your shoulder as you read? I’m betting you don’t.

Let’s say you were reading this by clicking a link on Facebook. If so, Facebook would be recording that fact — and every other action you took while you were on its site.

If, instead, you were to access this review on my website using Chrome, Internet Explorer, or IOS, then you’d be adding to the databanks of Google, Microsoft, or Apple — and all the personal data you have stored on your computer, notebook, or smartphone would also be up for grabs.

Since you’re reading it on Amazon.com or Goodreads, you should know that Amazon is accumulating similar information about you and your preferences.

All of the above is true

Don’t believe me? You could read the Terms of Service you okayed when you installed any of those programs. Admit it, now: you didn’t read that 50-page document in four-point type — and you’re extremely unlikely to do so even now. The Terms of Service issued by the companies that provide the software you use (and sometimes hardware, too) permit them to learn everything there is to know about you online and to do with it what they will. The same goes for any online vendor you’ve ever bought anything at all from. And what they all do is not just tailor their ads to your tastes and behavior: they sell that data to data brokers such as Axciom, Epsilon, and ReedElsevier, who in turn make it available to all comers. Including Internet thieves, terrorists, stalkers, anarchist hackers, and other miscreants. Assuming those same evil-doers haven’t already obtained all your information by hacking into massive databases such as those maintained by Target or Sony or, for that matter, the federal government.

Yes, you read that right: If you do practically anything online, your life is an open book to the world (unless you happen to be extremely sophisticated about cyber security). As Marc Goodman puts it in Future Crimes, “The more we plug our devices and our lives into the global information grid — whether via mobile phones, social networks, elevators, or self-driving cars — the more vulnerable we become to those who know how the underlying technologies work and how to exploit them to their advantage . . . Simply stated, when everything is connected, everyone is vulnerable.” All the more so because the bad guys are usually two steps ahead of the rest of us.

Now comes the Internet of Things

As if this isn’t bad enough, just wait for the so-called Internet of Things to mature. Already, the car you drive may have as many as fifty microprocessors embedded within it. Once your home becomes a “smarthome,” with all lights, locks, heating, cooling, and appliances controllable through a handheld device, your life will truly become vulnerable to malware (viruses, Trojans, and worms) as well as the predations of an identity thief or some other variety of Internet crook.

Already, a truly diabolical thief can acquire software that enables him to hold your computer hostage, locking you out of all your files unless you pay a ransom running to hundreds or even thousands of dollars. (Bitcoin is the preferred mode of payment.) And even if that thief can be identified by name and address, he’s probably working in plain sight in St. Petersburg or Kiev and completely out of reach of law enforcement.

So, you think your antivirus program will keep the predators at bay? As Goodman writes, “the antivirus software you are running on your own computer is likely only catching 5 percent of the emerging threats targeting your machine.” Yes, five percent. Moreover, a cyber attack is typically detected not in minutes or hours, when something might be done about it, but in months or even years.

It turns out that the Internet is a far more complex and dangerous environment than you’re likely to know. Certainly, I wasn’t aware that Google has indexed only 16 terabytes of the data that comprises the Internet, while 7,500 terabytes are hidden from view. A German research institute determined “that there were forty-nine million strains of computer malware in the wild. By 2011, the antivirus company McAfee reported it was identifying two million new pieces of malware every month.” Yes, every month. And McAfee’s estimate is a conservative one.

Much bigger threats

If only our personal electronic devices alone were at risk! Consider the US electric grid, “often called the most complex machine in the world.” Goodman cites a report by the US Department of Energy revealing that the grid “connects fifty-eight hundred individual power plants and has more than 450,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines. Yet 70 percent of the grid’s key components are more than twenty-five years old. Each of these components used much older . . . technologies that are readily attackable and persistently targeted.” In fact, Goodman goes on to report that one utility “had been the target of more than 10,000 attempted cyber attacks each month.”

Can you think of a more effective way to shut down American civilization than taking out our electric grid?

Do you think the Pentagon could prevent this? Think again. Chinese hackers working for their government have already acquired all the data associated with the “$300 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter,” and that’s just the most expensive weapons system. They’ve also pilfered the plans for our missile defense system, our most advanced helicopters, and numerous others. “According to an FBI report,” Goodman writes, “China has secretly developed an army of 180,000 cyber spies and warriors, mounting an incredible ninety thousand computer attacks a year against the U.S. Defense Department networks alone.” And many of those attacks aren’t detected until years later.

You ain’t seen nothing yet

As anyone who is intimately familiar with the progress of scientific research and development, not just in the US but around the world, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and other contemporary fields of inquiry are on the verge of creating enormous new opportunities for good — and terrifying potential for harm.

Much of Future Crimes is devoted to the vulnerability of the electronic devices we use today. That’s Part One. In Part Two, Goodman justifies the book’s title by exploring “The Future of Crime.” Read this, and I guarantee that you will be shocked by many of the examples Goodman cites that point to the dangers inherent in the new technologies now on the drawing board.

In Part Three, “Surviving Progress,” Goodman advances a number of recommendations about how to fight back against the hackers and Internet criminals who bedevil us today — and ameliorate or prevent the damage that future technologies might wreak on ourselves and our society. Some of these recommendations are bold, imaginative, and realistic. Future Crimes should be read by every government policymaker and every concerned citizen.",4
HAL 9000,2.0 out of 5 stars,Future Crimes: Inside the Digital Underground and the Battle for Our Connected World,which is true -- covers hacking smart homes (lot already published on that),"Bizarre book . . . the title is Future Crime but the vast majority of the books just describes cybercirme cases that have occurred over the last, what?, several decades, I guess . . . there's nothing ""future"" about cybercrime. I started working in that area in 1988, and there was cybercrime then, nothing as complicated as we see now, but it was there and it has continued to expand and flourish ever since . . . due to law enforcement's difficulties in trying to deal with offshore cybercrime . . . a US cop can't do anything when Russian hackers steal money or intellectual property from US citizens, no extradition.

Then part two of the book -- entitled the future of crime, which certainly implies that what was in part one isn't futuristic crime, which is true -- covers hacking smart homes (lot already published on that), ""hacking you"", which I'm guessing isn't going to become a problem for a long time, if ever (there have been efforts to hack pacemakers, so if that qualifies as ""hacking you"", then we've seen some of that). Chapter 16's title is ""next generation -- why cyber was only the beginning,"" but all it talks about is AI issues . . . and as I think many of us (at least those of us who are/were sci-fi fans) know, that theme has been explored in science fiction for years. And I'm not sure what the conceptual point of demarcation is between ""cyber"" and ""AI"" when it comes to the behavior of artificially intelligent and/or semi-autonomous artifacts, nor am I sure why it matters.

And then, of course, there's the chapter modestly entitled ""surviving progress,"" which also hashes and rehashes a lot of notions that are in now way new (or likely to be viable) . . . except for the Cyber CDC, which is not a viable option. The author notes the good that the WHO and wellness CDC have done around the world . . . and then extrapolates from their success the proposition that a digital CDC would be equally successful . . . which does not follow at all. Essentially no government is going to oppose medical experimentation and testing that can benefit their citizens by defeating illnesses that kill or handicap its citizens. The Cyber-CDC, on the other hand, would interfere with cybercrime have states, which profit from their citizens' committing cybercrime and bringing revenue and intellectual property back to their economies. Won't happen.

I could go on, but, bottom line, most of the book is a rehash of older stories, ideas, etc. that weren't particularly good when they were new. Also, the book doesn't seem to have a coherent structure or a message . . . it's more like being stuck by someone who fancies themselves an expert in certain areas on a long flight and having to listen to their hackneyed, illogical rambles on their views on those topics. I bought the book used for a very good price, just to see if it was as bad as I expected; it was.",3

Chad Frisk,5.0 out of 5 stars,Future Crimes: Inside the Digital Underground and the Battle for Our Connected World,What You Don't Know Can Hurt You,"This is the most sobering book I have ever read.

The Internet is a wonderful thing. It has dramatically changed our lives, and created a number of opportunities for honest people to connect with each other in meaningful (and, admittedly, in less so meaningful) ways.

But it has a dark side. And it turns out we are much more vulnerable to it than we realize.

Marc Goodman, the FBI’s resident futurist, details the myriad ways in which we don’t understand the internet. More importantly - and horrifyingly - he explains how our ignorance is hurting us. From the data collection capabilities and distribution practices of our most trusted websites (think Google and Facebook), to data brokers who buy and sell that information indiscriminately, to the seedy underworld of crime that flourishes in router-enabled anonymity, I had no idea what I was opening myself up to every time I opened my web browser.

The Internet isn’t going away. In fact, it’s only going to become more ubiquitous. In the next decade billions of new devices will go online. Data will be streamed from your lightbulbs, your refrigerator, you front door, your wristwatch, and even the inside of your body.

As of right now, that data is visible to anyone who is willing to download the right illicit ap.

It’s also manipulatable.

Can you trust the data you see on your screens? Can you be sure that someone isn’t live streaming you from your own camera? Has your computer been infected with malware that is logging your every keystroke and shipping it directly to identity thieves in Kiev?

These are questions that it feels crazy to ask. I didn’t even think about them before reading this book. But after reading, I have no other choice but to reevaluate my relationship to the Internet. Because it turns out (again) that I don’t have any idea what’s going on.

This book will give you a look into worlds that you didn’t know existed. You won’t like what you see. You may never feel the same way about Wi-Fi again. Internet security (or the present lack of it) is intimately connected with our lives. This book didn’t make me happy. But I am very glad I read it, because sometimes what you don’t know can hurt you.

Technological progress is here, and accelerating faster than anyone can imagine. This book might help you survive it.",3

The book contains perhaps twenty pages of useful information and the rest is non-specific highly repetitive, scaremongering, speculative, empty-headed BS.

I agree with the general theme is that we are, with our information technologies, pushing upward (or perhaps downware) into darkness. But I'm totally bored by having to read page after page of rather uninteresting examples, purple prose and handwringing about the current and to come state of affairs.

That Boston Dynamics has been purchased by Google was a pearl. Let me see - there must be something else.

The author's main problem is that he really doesn't have the technical wit to do more than a lot of depressing handwringing about how hopeless it all is. Now, get this, I'm just as depressed about the state of things as he seems to be. But I don't write purple prose about it just to jack up my ratings. He's clearly writing to make a sale - sort of the Donald Trump of IT.",1

Hayles does for information and cybernetics what Foucault has done for sexuality, madness and the penal system, and she does it in a way that is thorough-going, highly contemporary, and enjoyable. Hayles offers the paradoxically devastating thesis that, in our visions of information, in our approaches to cybernetics, and in our handling of our own place in the world, Western culture has been hurtling down the wrong path. We have forgotten the physical. Worse, in order to forget the physical, to elide our own bodies, we had to forget or disregard a mountain of evidence. Not content to let us remain ignorant, Hayles recalls that evidence for us, shows us where we've come from, where we are, and offers some insight into where we're going.

Gabriel Tarr,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Designer's Guide to VHDL, Third Edition (Systems on Silicon)","Good reference, not a great learning aid","This is a good VHDL Language Reference Manual. If you work with VHDL regularly, it is good to have on your bookshelf. It is a bit unwieldy in the way the constructs are defined, in that almost every definition of a VHDL construct relies on previously defined constructs. However, this is pretty common in LRMs for other languages as well. But if you're not used to reading things like this, it will be very confusing at first.

As other posters have noted, this is not a good book to learn to do VLSI design. It teaches you the syntax of how to write VHDL, and that's it. VHDL, even more so than many other languages, gives you plenty of rope with which to hang yourself. Just because you can write something a certain way in VHDL does not mean you should. Certain constructs which are allowed in VHDL will cause synthesis tools massive headaches. Nor does the book really teach you when to use procedural vs concurrent statements, or any other things you really need to know when using VHDL for its intended purpose: VLSI design.",5
Daniel H,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Designer's Guide to VHDL, Third Edition (Systems on Silicon)","Kindle Edition - Terrible Quality, Not Edited","This book seems to be a very thorough treatment of VHDL (I'm no expert, so take that as it is). The book is well written and cohesive. I've been using this book in various forms since college, and I'm *still* using it. I like it.

HOWEVER

Just like the second edition Kindle version (which I finally got fed up with and was refunded), the third edition was clearly not edited after the Kindle conversion process. Take as an example Table 2.2: This is supposed to be a table of the VHDL operators, but tell me, what does the operator ""sllsrlorlror"" do? According to the table, it is the ""shift-left logicalshift-right logicalrotate leftrotate right""

Of course I understand what's going on here, and I can figure it out. But I shouldn't *have* to. It's wonderful that this book is available in the Kindle format. It's one more heavy book I don't have to lug around. But the quality is just not acceptable. This is a five-star book with one-star editing.

Also, since this covers up to version 200x, it did seem it missed a few attributes. Specifically one called ""unaffected"". It doesn't talk about this though its in the standard.

JC,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Designer's Guide to VHDL, Third Edition (Systems on Silicon)",Has its shortfalls,"I'm sure this book has its intended audience and uses, but I have some complaints specific to my purpose. I need to learn VHDL to create some hardware within the next 2-3 months. First, it takes Ashenden about 1000 words to say something that can be easily and concisely explained in 100 words. Secondly, his style is very formal and abstract, and makes little effort to relate VHDL to the actual hardware/physical implementation. For an HDL, I feel putting the code in context with the hardware is very important.

Finally, and most importantly, I find his method of explaining things frusterating. He starts with a very abstract, formal syntactical definition, and then gives a specific example. OK, that's all fine. But he doesn't fill in the middle. What about the details and specifics? They might be there, but if so, they are probably buried in pages of discussion. He teaches VHDL like you might teach English grammar. The problem is, I already know assembly, C/C++, Matlab, Java and digital logic, so it would speed learning if he would relate or define the concepts in terms that most electrical engineers have general competency in. Instead, he leaves me scratching my head for 15 minutes trying to figure out what he means by something as elementary as a multi-dimensional array.

I'm sure this book is a great Bible for people setting out to make a career in VHDL development--those who want the ""pure"" and the ""true"" religion. But for the practicing researcher or scientist who just wants to make some relatively simple device, it should serve more as a reference text than a learning guide. But even as a reference text it falls short, so I'm left wondering what it is particularly useful for.

The review by Emmett Chadwick Bearden is spot on! If you are a pure CS major, great, you found your book. If you are a practicing EE, this book is a little on the useless side (but probably still worth owning). His statement ""the examples only serve to make the concepts more mysterious"" is spot on.",11

Cynthia A. Hamil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Project: Soul Catcher: Secrets of Cyber and Cybernetic Warfare Revealed,Outstanding Information on Technologies Which Will Transform Our World and ALL Humanity,"THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOK For Our Generation!!!

Whether you realize it or not, there are technologies out there now that are FAR more advanced than even Sci-Fi Films. If people are not aware of what is going on and what is happening, then they will more easily fall victim to the tactics and maneuvers that are disclosed in this book.

Hard to imagine, but there are global and United States citizens that have fallen victim to a very nefarious ""control-freak type"" electronic remote harassment technology which can push people to take their own lives to end the torture that they are under. The electronic harassment can also be taken a step further to actually kill someone in a manner where it will look as though this were merely a ""death by natural causes"" (i.e. heart attack, aneurism, stroke, etc.).

This technology has the capacity to zap the hell out of people miles away and literally control their minds, their sleep patterns, broadcasting dreams, and remotely using MK Ultra techniques and electro-shock therapy on unconsenting private citizens.

If you feel that I am exaggerating this technology and you are having trouble believing that this is REAL, then do yourself a favor and watch the videos of Targeted Individuals - google the ""Presidential Commission on Bioethics led by Amy Gutman"". This video series features 20 different people who come forward to expose this technology and the horrid torture that they have been under in the privacy of their own homes, cars, and everywhere this satellite technology can reach.

------------

Dr. Robert Duncan wrote this with a consortium of scientists who have collaborated to bring you information that is highly classified. [Yes, they are whistle-blowing this technology.] Why? Because the history of mankind and our very independence, freedom, and lives depend up on this disclosure!

There are growing numbers of people who are coming forward as Targeted Individuals (T.I.'s) who are reporting their stories all over the internet and youtube.com. This is one of THE MOST IMPORTANT topics-- if you are someone who believes in FREEDOM and your civil rights as a human to make your own decisions and to control your own destiny.

If you are new to this information and do not have a background as a scientist, psychologist, computer programmer, etc... this is a very detailed book and requires a lot of concentrated effort to understand all of the technical terms. It basically gives you the type of detail that you would need to understand how the mind can be hacked into, almost as if it were a computer. (Read the article and hear the youtube interviews called ""The Mind Has No Firewall"", on the topic of psychotronic warfare and synthetic telepathy.

Man, my hat - and wig, is OFF to Robert Duncan and this group of scientists who have had the guts and determination to come forward and expose this technology. In my opinion, each of these people are doing something that is on the same level as what Gandhi and Martin Luther King accomplished. It is up to the world to read this and take heed to what they are saying.

These technologies, although can be used for the positive... if falling into the wrong hands, can be very devastating to human health, happiness, and their entire independent lives. In fact, if you are a ""targeted individual"" - this information possibly has the ability to SAVE Your LIfe!

If you can ONLY read ONE Book This Year... THIS is THE BOOK!!!
You won't believe the course that technology is taking... otherwise.

Knowledge IS Power. Stay ahead of the game by taking the time to read and understand this book!

----------

Blessings to each of these brave scientists who came forward to share this information.
You are truly making a huge step for Mankind... on the same level with Gandhi and Martin Luther King!

May you be protected by Angels to get the word out!
THIS is SO IMPORTANT!!! (I can't express this enough!!!)

According to my year and a half of research, this very technology is near the bottom of the chemtrail research rabbit hole and HAARP type technologies. If you've been staying on top of that subject, then this book is a MUST READ!!!",40
Joe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Project: Soul Catcher: Secrets of Cyber and Cybernetic Warfare Revealed,""" THE MIND HAS NO FIREWALL""","The Mind has no firewall.

The technology is out there and it is in use, unless you or anyone you know(highly likely)has come into contact with this deadly technology it is hard to understand how the system works.
""Inception(mind hacking),the movie was not a new concept."" This technology has been out there(maybe not exactly the way described in the movie) but there have been serious attempts to hack into the human mind for centuries. With modern technology it has become easier than ever to hack into everything and anything. The human mind being no exception.
Firewalls for the mind and technology to protect the unsuspecting mind. It is a must read for anyone who is interested in cybernetics. Most of the information presented is declassified. Soul catchers is a great way to explain this technology. Millions of people are unknowingly being added to classified databases and are being segregated by these tech tools. Massive databases and everyone's life being scrutinized like never before. Creating a world of slaves and masters.

Tell everyone you know. Tell anyone who is at all a curious person, or technically inclined. Don't be put off by folks who dismiss this most important book of the century at first glance. Especially tell younger people to take a look, and to even consider studying fields combining physics/programming/neurology to develop ways to ...to save the human race.

Dear all-- After an email I sent to a pacifist, at first, I was microwaved like a piece of meat in my apartment in San Francisco. (FYI: 1885 Pacific Ave, #201) One by one, my neighbors moved in and surrounded this apartment. (One neighbor, where the ones upstairs would go to, directly across the from apartment upstairs, was ""occupied"" by a Partner of a VC firm which funds CIA startups located on Sand Hill Road.)

They mostly shot from the apartment directly upstairs. I think They (the irradiators) must have a checklist that they go through: figure out the person's living pattern, especially when stationary (at PC, toilet, TV..), try and make them sick -my roommate and I coughed for 4 months... then force someone to sleep as often as possible, for the purpose of sleep, and brain entrainment.

They also have a sadistic checklist, too. They performed the following on both of us: SNEEZING, muscular cramping, foot and hand cramping, genital stimulation, headaches (transient and ongoing...I don't get headaches, nor do I sneeze), ""voice of god"" (throwing sound into your cochlea), sleep denial for days and days, for months on end. They can, indeed, make a person irate. I believe They must be stimulating the amygdala.

I went to the FBI, but realized they were in on it. (As I was sitting and waiting at the FBI waiting room, I saw one guy who had been loitering downstairs in front of my apartment building.) I think the FBI usually does the equipment-intensive monitoring (watching and listening to you via your cell phone), and the CIA and their young women lackys do the slow-kill irradiating.) The irradiators upstairs move around to the other apartments, only when the coast is clear. There is signaling going on, mostly by running the water for a certain lenght of time. People wait outside when it's the changing of the guard time to go home.

The first shooters were young-ish, lightweight women to dampen footsteps overhead.

It's a highly organized group.(I have a very good eye, and great hearing. I have appreciated and enjoyed the company of many ethnic groups as my friends growing up, and currently. And I can usually tell where a person is from.) I believe white folks who blend in with dual citizenship -and fake passports- serve as mercenaries in the US, for easier escape and to make it harder to prosecute.

I'm a current victim of brain entrainment. I experience, nightly and precisely, the symptoms Dr. Duncan describes on page 11 and elsewhere: 3 Hertz (or lower)swishing sound, flickering in my vision, tiredness, pulsing (and ongoing, severe) tinitus. I've never had tinitus, nor any of the above symptoms I've described hardly ever in my life before. I know my body extremely well (I had to constantly monitor my dad's health), and these symptoms are beyond any shadow of a doubt abnormal.

The pain I've experienced was and is both acute, and ongoing. It has severely impacted my physical as well as mental outlook on life.

It is like being tortured 24/7 *in* your home for years.

Anywhere you sit, it starts again. There is much more to say... It is a very dark subject.

Futhermore, I've had thoughts I've never had before. I feel I've had forced images scrolling when I've been half asleep, assumedly, for pre cognitive responses. Unnerving.

Do not underestimate Dr. Duncan's book. This will change governments. They will, IMHO, attempt to control the planet.

Read this book and similar, ASAP. Read it today.

Suggestion: SHARE this book very quietly with as many people as possible.

Suggestion: DO NOT discuss this or any other private matters anywhere near your cell phone. Do not be an ""I don't have anything to hide...exhibitionist"" with any of your info to These sneaky, sadistic, and slow assassinators. If they have the capacity to listen to you, to psychologically profile you, They also have the capacity to set you up for one of their own false flag or more mundane crimes. The LESS they know about you, what your home looks like,...even what you ate for lunch, the better.

Suggestion: Watch Dimitry Khalezov's 4-hour video on controlled demolition, too. I believe the very same people who are using these weapons to irradiate whoever they don't like or feel like, in the United States, stem from the same group who nuked the WTC on 9/11. -- They more you know, at some point, the more it may all make sense.

I believe that technology is going through many changes and it may be possible to bring those responsible to justice (including patent-holders and contractors), some time in the future and in an international court. These cybernetic attacks on individuals are illegal and no one would allow this to be done to them by choice. I do not agree that there will be some kind of ""transhumanism"".

G Whiteman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Project: Soul Catcher: Secrets of Cyber and Cybernetic Warfare Revealed,I am being harrassed with this Technology,"Fantastic , and well done Duncan . This book does not weigh the reader down with technical know explanations . He basically describes how Intelligence services around the world have worked out how to use specialized RADAR technology to read peoples minds ! But not only this , to write programs that can be run on peoples minds using this technology. I experienced a script run about a month ago but only now realize that it was a figment of THEIR imagination : a couple of 6'5"" shirtless stallions , one Korea and the other Euro (with Mohawk haircut ) ran towards me and past me on my evening jog !...I wonder what my handlers are up to?
The book is well put together as he tries to cover all bases in this weird technology and tell indepth about how torture techniques have been translated to mind projection machines so that a person can be made to feel as if being tortured and it all happens in the brain . I'm ordering part 1 pronto .
I have been harassed for many years using sleep and mood entrainment that makes life hard .Those who oppose multiculti are enemies of this new 'democratic' state.
Must read for anyone interested in politics as this technology means the CIA and its affiliate organizations around the West can force politicians to do their bidding.Either directly or indirectly.
As a tip
The only effective way to thwart this technology (I have personally found by trial and error) is by placing neodymium magnets around you head ! Use a sweat band (magnets on either side to hold them on ) with a four pattern all in the same pole direction and one on the top of your head clamped onto hair . This stops this technology (which is cleaver but low powered) from being able to lock on to the brain wave patten and move it around driving you nuts . Good luck humanity will need it as the criminals have taken over the police station !",9

HelloNeo555,5.0 out of 5 stars,Project: Soul Catcher: Secrets of Cyber and Cybernetic Warfare Revealed,Testimony From A True Victim and Believer!,"Every Adult should read this book as soon as possible. This will kickstart the Reader's interest: the statement reported in Dr. Duncan's courageous book, that our American Department of Defense is ""testing a scalable, artificial intelligence, psychotronic mind virus called Satan666."" I've been a victim of the gruesome, painful, psychologically and physically ruinous effects of the Head Hacking and remote mind control technologies Dr. Duncan describes in technical detail, which is nevertheless presented in language accessible to the average Reader. These technologies exist and they are not subtle in their effects. These weapons systems and torture technologies were tested on ME, without my conscious will and consent. I cannot thank Dr. Duncan enough for standing up for the Truth and bringing this grotesque and horrific technology into the Court of Public Opinion. This is no sci-fi Dystopian Future, nor is it a fictional Techno-punk thriller- these wretched mind viruses, head-hacking programs, electronic and psychotronic weapons ARE being tested, sadistically, on American citizens NOW. And I presume our tax payer dollars are being spent on SATAN666 and other mind viruses, which ought to be enough to infuriate any Reader with a sense of justice and love for our country, and pity for the hapless, innocent human beings whose basic human rights are being violated by the Persons behind these ""secret military projects."" To understand the horrific and complex effects upon the human body and psyche one must, alas, either read this book, or be one of the many unfortunate crash-test dummies and lab rats for this array of monstrous, illegal, immoral, deep black operations projects - including the latest version of Mind Control. The concept of creating ""Manchurian Candidates"" is not dead! These criminal minds are using Satellite technology to invade every aspect of their chosen victims' lives, all the way to the mapping of their brains. They can read your mind, speak to you using synthetic telepathy, project strange vibrating images into your brain, view the inside of your house, tap into your phone and computer, practice slow-kill, agonizing torture techniques on anyone (will YOU be next?). All in some deranged effort to perfect these relatively unknown weapons, most intended to drive their intended victim insane or even, in some persons, provoke deliberate suicide. You must read this book to grok the horror - and have the flex to transcend your understandable human resistance to the idea that our own government would betray your human rights just to be one up on the enemy in a virtual Mind War, which literally leaves your very brain open to anyone able to operate these systems. Scared? You should be. The Victims of this Targeting come from every walk of life. Usually you are not aware of it until the bizarre ""coincidences"" and run-ins with Gangstalkers intensify, persons completely unknown to you, who confront you, often in groups, quote conversations you've lately engaged in on your phone, who mimic you and your friends, who seem to know everything about you - because they DO. I'm an over 50 Grandmother, and they did this stuff to me! New Agers Beware! I was told the person speaking to me was my ""Spirit Guide."" I met this ""Guide"" - he is a Human Being! Dr. Duncan's brave exposure of this Grave New World will describe for the Reader how all this faux Hocus Pocus is accomplished - using technology with which he is well acquainted and the average American could never have believed existed. Read - and believe. ""People shouldn't be afraid of their Government. Government should be afraid of their people."" Speak out! One Reviewer stated, ""This book will get the author killed."" He's alive, thank God. As for me, a lifelong sufferer, I say, ""Come and get me! You've destroyed my life, anyway!""",8

JimmyBlues,3.0 out of 5 stars,Project: Soul Catcher: Secrets of Cyber and Cybernetic Warfare Revealed,"Interesting Book - However, Read It With A Jaded Eye","I find that much of what Duncan writes about is in regard to how the alphabet agencies can track the body by its own unique electromagnetic frequencies, so that computer implants are no longer necessary.

NSA whistleblower John St. Clair Akwei first exposed this technology in 1992 as part of a civil action which he
filed against the NSA. Google: Akwei VS NSA. Yet to my knowledge Dr. Duncan never acknowledges
Akwei's lawsuit, or the fact that it was dismissed by a federal circuit court judge (Stanley Sporkin) on the same
day that Akwei filed his lawsuit with Sporkin.

Given that we now know that Akwei's 1992 civil action contains some astonishing and disturbing information with regard to how the NSA decodes the brain maps of millions of American citizens so that they can be remotely scanned by way of the electromagnetic spectrum - using signals intelligence technology - there's little doubt that Sporkin was told to dismiss Akwei's lawsuit so that an American jury would never be able to render a verdict regarding the NSA, based on the contents of this precedent setting lawsuit..

While I am certain that Dr. Duncan's claim regarding the ability to track the human body by its own unique EMF signatures is true, I suspect that Duncan is controlled opposition for the Intelligence community, so I would glean what I could from this book yet remain skeptical of this guy.

I say this because you can't completely trust any government whistleblower, since you can never tell if they are controlled opposition or not. And many of them, including this guy, are megalomaniacs who believe that they are best thing since sliced bread.

This book is a worthwhile read because it describes some of the Orwellian signals intelligence surveillance being used by the U.S. Military Industrial Intelligence complex (these technologies are used by all industrialized governments in the modern day) and how the American people no longer have any privacy left.

Since even when within the privacy of their own homes, their thoughts can be remotely scanned and decoded by
NSA cryptologists or private contractors who work for the NSA, such as Booz Allen Hamilton; those who utilize artificial telepathy which operated through the air via the electromagnetic spectrum.

This technology makes Orwell's 1984 seem tame by comparison.",10

Duncan is actually holding back in his accounts, though survivors of the full experience will recognize certain allusions- ""The Cheshire Cat Smile"" particularly. We've all seen this smile on the face of Jared Loughner, but the details behind it are unbelievable even after experiencing it.
If there's one complaint I have, it is the inaccessibility of the author. It's understandable, but, having read this, and, apparently, missing out on the mindavenger email address, I'm left with a couple questions I wish I could have answered.

Not only has CIA secret rendition and torture not only continued under Obama, it has proliferated. Obama's cronies AUTHORED NDAA and he signed it. From this point, the book lost much credibility with me. Also, the typographic errors were ridiculous. No spell check or proof read before it went to print? Lastly, I'm not sure where the author made up his quotes from the Quran; but let me assure those that might read this book. There is only 1 book in the Quran, not mulitples like the Talmud. Also chapters are called Surahs. Case in point was a quote from Volume 4, Book 54, Number 491.. First, there is only 1 volume of the Quran. Second, the SURAH 54 titled ""The Moon"" has only 55 verses. So, where the author pulled this from (and many other supposed Quranic examples) I have NO clue.

There are so many typos (or maybe spelling errors?!) and logical mistakes in this book I eventually got sick of marking them all. I'll give a few examples.

E.g., on the second page of chapter one: ""...but also includes smart phones, routers, tablets, printers, tablets, and..."" Really? Tablets twice? Wow, tablets must be *really* important.

E.g., The first two review questions at the end of chapter one are reproduced at the end of chapter two...

E.g., In chapter 6 the author perpetuates the myth that overwriting a disk ""seven time is... a good rule of thumb."" With no explanation for why it is a good rule of thumb. Because there is no good explanation. The author also includes this as an answer to one of the review questions...

E.g., In chapter 10 the author claims you can ""set the value to 0x00000001"" of the key ""HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\StorageDevicePolicies"" to write protect a mobile device. This is wrong. The above-mentioned key has a value called ""WriteProtect"" and the data stored in that is to be set to 0x00000001.

E.g., the section on SQL injection on pages 277-279 repeats much of the section on SQL injection on pages 191-193.

Overall, even though this book is pretty darn bad, it is probably still a little better than the official CCFP textbook. As a final thought I will mention that the author insists on ending innumerable sentences with prepositions. It is super annoying.

Daniel Louis Rera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Cybernetics, Second Edition: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine","Read it. Well, most of it.","This was a very interesting book. It had some idiosyncrasies that prevented me from giving it a higher rating, but other than that, the subject matter and breath were fascinating enough for me to certainly recommend it to anyone with any interest in cybernetics as a broad concept.

Let me first say that there were a few chapters in the beginning and end that were needlessly technical and mathematical. It isn't so much that I object to the existence of mathematical proofs in their proper context, but it seemed unnecessarily detailed for the overall purpose and thrust of the book. After working my way through a few of the demonstrations, I eventually gave up an took the author's word on the soundness of his conclusions. I think this is fair enough to do, so much so, in fact, that I started to wonder why he was making me flip past pages upon pages of dense calculus only to arrive at a summary paragraph that would elucidate the meaning of his findings. At one point he attempts to justify this technique by saying something to the effect of: it would take me much longer to put these formulae into common English, so read them for their condensed shorthand value. I, as the reader, would have been perfectly willing to let him dispose of the rigor for the sake of cleaner text. But whatever; maybe people really wanted to delve into that level of demonstration.

In addition, for as direct and focused Wiener seems to be as a mathematician, his thoughts, and even his prose, seem disjointed and meandering. He quickly moves from one large concept to the next, sometimes leaving the reader reeling trying to catch up. He goes on digressions that seemed opinionated and lengthy, and, when returning to the original thread, makes no real indication that he has returned. Other times these digressions will be nearly freeform transitions between concepts, similarly lacking indication that he has departed one concept and started addressing another. That he does both of these leaves the reader wondering if the text is moving forward or looping back. I would like to think that the author was making some larger point about the nature of cybernetics though this ambiguity, but this seems doubtful to me.

These criticisms are small, however, taken in relation to the positive aspects of this book. The conclusions being reached by Wiener might seem banal to a contemporary reader, but this only lends credibility to their influence. Weiner not only anticipates a great deal of the future of computing, he also strongly develops a theory of the animal (and human) as, essentially, an organic computing machine; not just the brain, but the whole organism. Early in the work, he distinguishes this position from simplistic Cartesian materialism (i.e. with respect to Descartes' conception of animals as sophisticated machines), and, instead, argues for a vitalism that explains the soul as a material concept. It is non-symmetrical feedback, as unfolding through time, that makes the system seem vital as opposed to mechanical, and it is this level of complexity that makes the behavior of animals and humans seem so radically different than the motions of planets or pendulums.

The remainder of the work goes on to apply the cybernetic concept of feedback to a whole range of biological phenomena and computational questions in a way that demonstrates the power of the theory and the broadness of its application. So much of what Wiener says is taken as understood in modern times that it is easy to lose sight of how striking his claims really are.",1

After first introducing the book by playing off of our fear of the fictional cyborgs we all know from the movies ie Terminator, Eve 8, Cable - the book begins with a brief introduction of the author's background; Andy Clark claims that it was during his time directing a new interdisciplinary program in philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology that he first realized this concept of ""cyborg"" that he details in this book. From here he introduces the idea of humans being intrinsically technology dependent beings. He states that his goal in writing such a book is ""to hijack that image (our preconceived notion of cyborg) and to reshape it, revealing it as a disguised vision of our own biological nature."" What really impressed me about his style of argument and writing was his use of examples from research in many different fields to illustrate his point. Where many times we see arguments like his fall into ambiguity and opinion, his use of concrete examples helps paint the picture of the story he tells.

The book itself is very short, consisting of only 8 chapters, however every chapter has been thoroughly annotated so readers can dive deeper if they wish. For the sake of my synopsis I've divided the book into two halves.

Chapters 1-3
The first chapter of the book is spent educating the reader on where the term cyborg originally came from putting it in the context of the first early technologies which ""sought to incorporate exogenous components extending the self-regulating control function of the organism in order to adapt it to new environments"" Here Clark cites early osmotic pumps, auditory prosthetics, and peripheral nerve interfaces. The focus of this chapter is to draw out what Clark calls ""an ancient western prejudice"" which creates the illusionary belief that the mind is distinctly different from the rest of natural order. Instead of viewing technology as something distinct from our human nature he argues that technology is integrated and always has been integrated with our nature placing us in our current condition at a transition point between first wave (pen,paper,diagram, and digital media) and second wave (personalized, online, dynamic biotechnological unions) technologies. The cell phone is the technology he uses as an example of this transition.

Moving from the concrete into more abstract realms Andy Clark then introduces the idea of transparent and opaque technologies before diving into his categorization of technologies, which he labels ""ready-to-hand"" and ""present-at-hand."" In categorizing the way people perceive and interact with technologies Clark attempts to bring some level of awareness to how we as lay people may simply generalize and interact with technologies and our environment taking what we have right in front of us for granted. The importance of understanding concepts such as these are again driven home using experimental example - in this case the ability of chimps who are trained to reason symbolically vs chimps who are not. Andy uses this example to make his point that only the chimps who were trained to reason symbolically were then able to understand higher order relationships - what he calls the relation between relations.

Chapters 4-8
Once laying out this abstract scaffold for his argument Andy Clark gets into his answers to bigger questions: Where are we? and What are we?. Here he takes the reader through reported experiments and experiences, which alter human perception through illusions and the use of technology based telepresence to play with the idea of embodied consciousness. From here he explores the application and ethics of such technologies for the future of mankind. Andy Clark takes a look at how this knowledge is already currently being used through computational application dipping into the darker areas of misuse of such information/technology. He ends this section making the point that it is not technology itself that is evil; it's how the technology is used. In conclusion Andy Clark argues that it's not the preconceived invasive and material tools themselves that make us cyborgs rather it's the extended thinking systems that are created as a result of these tools that make us who we are.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I especially liked the importance he gives to interdisciplinary perspectives. Through the experience of working on constructing an interdisciplinary research program at Georgia Tech under Dr. Steve Potter I came to notice and support many of the ideas presented here. What impressed me most about the book was the amazing job the author does in translating ideas to the reader through examples while at the same time demonstrating the concept in the structure of his writing. For example in introducing the idea of the symbolically reasoning chimps he is setting up the scaffold to introduce his concept of scaffolded thinking.

The biggest problem I can see readers having with this book is what can appear as Andy Clark's loose use of what he defines as a technology. Because he is speaking of technology in both a physical and metaphysical sense I can see many readers having a hard time accepting the case that he makes if they do not consider what he has to say carefully. If the reader does buy into Clark's definition, this book is an amazing source of perspective on how we as human beings have grown in an interlocked web of biology and technology. In my opinion what Andy Clark talks about in this book has incredible application in models of education and perspective regardless of opinion on the monistic, dualist, or pluralist nature of the world.",1
Kjell Oevergaard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies, and the Future of Human Intelligence",Cyborgs in the Flesh,"Clark presents an argument that we do not need to implant microchips or electronic prostheses in our body to become Cyborgs, - We are already Cyborgs. The argument is based in our natural ability to use tools and technics to enhance our capabilities for movement, cognition and perception.

The book is easy to read and draws upon research from the fields of robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, cybernetics, dynamic systems theory, feminist theory, cognitive anthropology and english litterature studies.

The fact that he draws upon such diverse fields of research does not reduce the logic or persuasiveness of his arguments, but rather show the interdisciplinary basis for the book. The breadth of the arguments' basis is a major plus with this book, showing that the interplay between humans and technology are not merely technical but also something which changes who we are and how we understand our selves.",2

~Cathy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Guide to Firewalls and VPNs,"Text 4, Questions 2","This is the third? fourth? textbook I've used out of the Cengage series. I have Principles of Information Security and Security+ Guide to Network Security Fundamentals sitting on my shelf across the room, and I think there's another book in the same series sitting around here somewhere. The books look similar and have very similar content. There's a little more of this in this one and a little more of that in that one, but the content isn't radically different. If you've mastered one book, you probably can do pretty well on tests taken out of the others. In fact, on a couple questions where I couldn't recall a factoid and couldn't find it in this book, I found it in one of my old textbooks. If this is the first of these similar texts you use, you'll learn a lot: if it's not, you'll get a lot of review. (To be fair, I'm rock-solid on what's covered!)

Unfortunately, the exercises at the ends of the chapters are a hot mess. It wasn't always clear to me what the review questions were getting at, and when the specific answers they're looking for aren't stated clearly, it's all a big guessing game and not a fun one.

It was the same with some of the real world exercises and hands-on projects.

By far the worst problem, however, is the fact that this book is so far out of date. Project 4-1 tells you that you need a computer running Windows XP or Vista. Project 5-1 needs Vista or XP SP3 *headdesk* Many of the exercises couldn't be completed on my Windows 8 computer. I tried to approximate them as best I could, but whatever I was supposed to find often wasn't where it had been in earlier versions of Windows, and what I got looked drastically different from what the book said. The running case project calls for VirtualBox 3.2.6 for Windows hosts. The current version appears to be 4.3.2 and 3.2.6 isn't available even in legacy builds (although older, unsupported versions are available.) No worries about that because the book also calls for Vyatta VC6.0 - Virtualization ISO for the Vyatta software firewall application that you're supposed to run in VirtualBox. The website given redirects to that of the company that seems to have absorbed or bought out Vyatta. I wasn't able to locate the software firewall. This running case project continues through the book, leaving the student unable to complete a lot of the hands-on exercises that would have given practical skills that weren't covered in the text or in the other books I've used. A pity, because I would have liked to get the experience.",4

In 1961, It did much more than just put me on my quest for self-improvement. For the very first time, someone connected the mind to the body and brought home the old, simple adage ... ""Change your Mind and you change your life!""

That was Psycho-Cybernetics. That was the principle of Self Image Psychology ... proven and verified by science itself as an irresistible and powerful no nonsense psychology of happiness and fulfillment.

From there on ... for decades ... everything else that was printed in the Self Help Industry became supporting commentary for the principles in this book.

An now ... the new ""enhanced"" version of Psycho-Cybernetics just arrived. And Yesssss!!! I enjoyed this one as much as the original. If not more so!

Comparing the two, the new authors kept the voice and the insights of the original text intact, integrating only the updates needed for new generations to come to experience and cherish the joy of reading this old, new classic for the first time. And experience it, you will. You cannot do otherwise.

Indeed, it gives me great pleasure to recommend this new version of the book that's been around for over a half century. If you are not among the 35 million+ people who read the older one ... please, do yourself a favor ... get a copy now and read it!

You will find that Psycho-Cybernetics will do it to you, as it did it to us, decades ago. True to its kind, the new Enhanced version of Psycho-Cybernetics is still the only book that scientifically proves the principle of Self Image Psychology and makes it the new foundation for a new century's hope, success and the dream of a better life.

I was listening to a podcast and the host mentioned this book, which was something I've never heard about - ever or anywhere. I looked it up on Amazon and decided to order it. I am sure glad I did. For me, it brought all of the other ideas, concepts and practices together. Things like affirmations, burning desires, faith, action - they all are great, as long as they're operating in conjunction with the way you see yourself and want to see yourself. This book really stresses the importance of focusing on your self-image, which is something I've found many of the other works glossed over or lacked.

Brian Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",Funny name. Great book!," “Creative striving for a goal that is important to you as a result of your own deep felt needs, aspirations and talents (and not the symbols which the ‘Joneses’ expect you to display) brings happiness as well as success because you will be functioning as you were meant to function. Man is by nature a goal-striving being. And because man is ‘built that way’ he is not happy unless he is functioning the way he was made to function—as a goal-striver. Thus true success and true happiness not only go together but each enhances the other.”

“Every human being has been literally ‘engineered for success’ by his Creator. Every human being has access to a power greater than himself.”

~ Maxwell Maltz from Psycho-Cybernetics

Psycho-Cybernetics. Funny name.

Great book! Maxwell Maltz was a world-renowned plastic surgeon who discovered that, while some people’s lives changed dramatically after he altered their appearance through plastic surgery, some people’s lives *didn’t*. He deduced that the primary factor that differentiated these groups was their self-image—not what they saw in the mirror but the images they had of themselves in their MINDS. Cool stuff.

He spent the second half of his career merging this self-image psychology with the then-popular science of “cybernetics”—which studies how things like guided missiles or “servo-mechanisms” hit their targets through a clear goal and constant adjustment of their course.

Here are some of the Big Ideas:

1. Cybernetics - Servo-mechanisms & you.
2. The Success Instinct - We’ve all got it!
3. Imagination - The first key.
4. Dehypnotize Yourself! - Starting now. :)
5. Rational Thought - How to use it.

Here’s to getting our Psycho-Cybernetic on as we set inspired goals, imagine our ideals, take action as we correct inevitable mistakes and practice FEELING our success. :)

WWF,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",Salesmen and sports,"This Dan Kennedy revision of Maxwell Maltz's original Pscyho-cybernetics is in my opinion so geared towards salesmen and sports that if you're not a salesman, athlete, sports fan or an avid golfer, the text can be hard to get through. Sadly, Maltz's original version of Psycho-cybernetics is not offered as a Kindle book, which is why I bought this one.
Maltz's original, which I read as a teenager in the 70s, also featured athletes and salespeople, but Maltz was more inclusive in his approach. This new version should be entitled something like ""Psycho-cybernetics for Salesmen and Sports."" Salesmen and sports are great and important, but potential readers should at least be given some indication that Kennedy has taken Maltz's book so heavily in that direction so that they can decide whether or not it's really for them.",13

It starts slow and after 2 or 3 chapters I was beginning to question the purchase. ""There is nothing to DO"" I thought. Then after it got going I felt there was TOO MUCH to do. Lots of excersises.

Of course, like so many things, the crux is in the application. Will you use it?

I think the thing I liked best is that you can really hear Dr Maltzs' passion for humanity and sincere desire to help. He seems like a wonderful man.

Also that he isn't in the pie-in-the-sky ""anyone can do anything"" camp. He teaches us to be truthful about our actual limitations, which do have limits, but are far above what most people do or even aspire to.

More than one reading and reading into details were necessary for me to grasp the right way to visualize what I wanted. The essentials of the book probably could me summarized in one chapter but the book includes a lot of examples, typical of this type of books. I did not achieve much the first couple of months on my first goal of reach my ideal weight. Then, my wife got me into a weight loss program and now I am well on my way to reach my goal. I keep doing the relaxation and visualization of reaching my ideal weight.

Opinion: I seek for a way to ""program"" the subconscious for a long time and this is the closest thing I have found. I started with a goal and the right tool just came along and I do not believe in coincidences. The weight loss program is making me loss weight. The techniques described in the book makes me follow the program with a very high level of discipline. The desire to reach my target weight is so high that I am able to sort almost all challenges I face to deviate from the weight loss program. I think that for the cost of the book is worth the try if you believe that you are a person of habit, that you behavior is ruled by your subconscious and you need to program that subconscious mind to change your behavior and achieve your goal",1

I knew it was a good book the minute I read ""You are not inferior. You are not superior. You are YOU"". I knew it was a good book when I read about how Maltz dismisses obtaining positive self image through ""willpower"". How many of you have heard well-meaning friends and coworkers say ""think positive"" about something that troubles you? How many of you have wondered why this well-meaning advice seldom helps? Maltz hits the nail on the head when he tells, and illustrates, why willpower and forcing positive thoughts into your head does not work. AND....he specifically tells you how to change your thought process so the positive thoughts come naturally. He gives you simple (but important) exercises to help you obtain and use the concepts he teaches.

I am a firm believe that once you have a positive image, life seems to turn out better. Not only does it look better through clear (instead of mud-shaded) glasses....but your new found self image will help you get the things you want. It will give you the power to go after what you want because you finally feel worthy. Instead of brainwashings and piecemeal advice, Maltz lays a solid groundwork using pure logic as to why YOU are worthy, and how you can convince yourself of this fact. He even gives concrete visuals to aid his lessons (healing emotional scars, much like facial scars). Emotional facelift.

Jory Kahn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",Count yourself lucky if you run across this book. Don't let the dated presentation put you off.,"There are many, many gems in this book, don't let the dated presentation put you off. The sooner in life you can get these perspectives, the better for you and your loved ones. The theme in each chapter tends to develop somewhat slowly. Maltz tends to gather various points, from many different authors and sources, and takes some pages so that they coalesce into very significant and meaningful approaches to life that have immense practical value. And this is a workbook, meant to be used as a guide for your own personal work, which we all need to do very much of. Just reading it quickly through and moving on to the next book would be a huge waste. Count yourself lucky if you run across this book, bear with the presentation, and find the parts that have you wondering, and take them to heart, make them yours.

David J. Bradley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",Vital for Managing Oneself,"Very useful book for managing oneself. Mastering the art of nurturing one's self-image, self-acceptance, and self-love can be a lifelong journey. I'd say it likely is for many; or at least it's a major challenge that often goes unacknowledged.

I personally found much of the material to be ... not dense ... but dry. I hate to say that because Maltz is clearly such an intelligent man with an important message and helpful advice. But, it is true, in my opinion.

If you are challenged by insecurities and an inaccurate, negative self-image, this is a must-read.",1

After several moves, it was lost. I recently repurchased it due to it's past impact on my thinking. A primary point that the late Dr. Maltz emphasized was his observation that plastic surgery had unexpected results with different people. For some, a minor correction caused a major personality change for the better. For others, even where the cosmetic change was more pronounced, the person's personality changed little, if at all. He attributed this to the person's innner / self image. Another key point was the power of visualization, that, if vivid / realistic enough, can have the same effect on the brain as if actually seeing / doing, a point now used regularly in sports training, et al. Both these points and others helped me immensely through my teen years and into early adulthood to break out of my ""shell"", and minimize the tendency to prejudge outcomes or approach change / the unknown negatively. The fact that his book continues to sell, and that there are several spin-offs, is testimony to the timelessness of these points.",4

I found the author Dr. Maltz to be incredibly insightful and the no nonsense way he delivered the information was rather refreshing. I've read my fair share of ""self help"" books and I can honestly
say that most of them carry on a lot about psychological mumbo jumbo, but NOT this one! Dr Maltz is a serious straight shooter and he really just says it like it is. I found many of the ideas he presented to cause ""ah ha"" moments inside me and the information is also very relevant, even in todays world which at first I thought might be an issue since this book was written many years ago. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a way to better understand their self-image and in essence make it better.
By far my favorite part of the book is the idea he delivers that we don't need to dredge up our past and relive it and ""figure it out"" in order to get over it. He just basically says, forget it, and move on! I LOVED THAT!! It makes me feel free from past baggage that I thought may have been holding me back. Really a great book!

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",Best book for self development I've found,"I have been studying psychology for the past 3 years at least, and have delved into topics such as NLP, hypnosis, destructive patterns etc. I have studied each of these topics and more in great depth and detail, and have to say that this book is by far the most treasured possession I own. This book is what I consider to be the answer, the key to all of self development. If you want to accomplish ANYTHING and you are not, there is a reason for it, and this book can help you. If you will read it, and then re-read it, and then re-read it, until you begin to fully understand and comprehend the principles and concepts presented, it will change your life....dramatically.

The book's whole premise is that we all behave not according to how things actually are, but how we perceive them to be. As a result of this, our beliefs can be very skewed, and thus our behavior will be as well. It is the task of this book to teach and instruct the reader in how to recognize irrational beliefs, use rational conscious thought to determine what they want to believe instead, and then use principles such as ""theater in the mind"" and ""acting as if"" to create a new reality experienced by your mind, which will program your self image, and thus create a new objective reality around you.

My personal opinion is that this book contains the key, the solution to any problem you are currently having, which you want to change but don't know how to, or are unsure of where to start. I highly recommend it.",8
Gadgeteer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life","Written decades ago, but still pertinent","Dr. Maltz, originally a face surgeon, came to recognize in his patients a need for a positive self image, which need transcended the physical characteristics that patients wanted improved.

He compares the methodology of achieving a desired improvement in one's self image with that used in the design of modern physical automatic control systems (he uses the term ""Cybernetics"" to describe the servomechanism systems of his day, such as those used in military fire control systems).

The concept is imaginative, and Dr. Maltz uses most of his book to describe various methods for helping change one's self image to the one that is desired, presumably by using negative feedback control to minimize the difference between one's current self image and one's desired self image, similar in concept to how military fire control systems operate.

While the basic ideas presented by Dr. Maltz are intriguing the human brain is so much more complex than the design of a military fire control system that the basic concepts presented must be taken with this important limitation in mind.

The fact that book is still in print after many decades and has sold many millions of copies, however, is a tribute to some validity of Dr. Maltz's basic concepts.",3

Phil Saparov,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",Life-changing read,"I used the advice presented in this book to bring about major change with great results at least twice.
First, when I sprained my knee and tore my ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament), I used the concept of striving towards a goal and thinking of my physical body as a servo-mechanism to heal myself. Where I got the method of healing is a whole 'nother story. But the concept of driving yourself towards an image of Health instead of trying to get away from disease really helped.

It no longer mattered what exactly was wrong with my knee - whether it was a partial or complete tear, or whether one or two menisci had been torn, and to which degree. The idea was to focus on the solution instead of the problem. It took me about 3 months to get back to living a normal life, where I could dance, run, and even do heavy squats again.

The second time I used this concept was when I had completely exhausted my system as a result of emotionally and physically draining work that I had been doing for a long time and for too many hours per week. At some point, all of a sudden, I got a whole host of physical and emotional problems, the worst of which was a pretty severe case of depression.

I changed my job, and went in for different therapies, some of which helped to a degree. But I attribute most of the success, especially in the emotional part, to Psychocybernetics. You see, different therapists analyzed my condition and tried to heal each of the causes that might have had an ill effect on me. This made me focus too much on the causes, which were the problem, instead of focusing on the solution.

Once again, I armed myself with Psychocybernetics and went to work. It took me about 3-4 months to feel almost 100% again. But the most important thing that I remember was that as soon I started to focus on the image of health and think about all the things I would do as soon as I was better, that's when my healing really took off.

Buy it. Use it.
Best,

Phil Saparov",13

Tyler Zambori,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",Positive thinking at last!,"Finally, a book on positive thinking that can actually help. it relies
on conscious methods of re-programming yourself, not on any kind of self-hypnosis. There are tons of great and insightful reviews of other editions of this book, and I can't improve on them very much, but I will say that I have at least achieved fewer mental obstacles. I've only been using this method a couple of months, but it is nicer. Some hypnotists recommended to me that I get an older edition of this book, one that has not been messed with by any other additional authors, so I got this one.
It takes time to learn, and even be aware of the negative messages you give yourself, but it's worth it to do it all consciously until it all becomes second nature. I'm still working on it. This book is way better than anything Dale Carnegie ever wrote about positive thinking.",1

A must study for improvement of self, motivation, goals and just plain being better at what you want to be. Even use the information and lessons learned on children, co-workers, friends, relatives and everyone you come in contact with (in a positive not manipulative manner).

The beginning was so revolutionary that I expected the rest of the book to just reiterate these findings.

Martin Zakostelsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",Classic masterpiece still shining,"After reading quite a few self-help and self-examination books, this is the book I was waiting for. Although at first I was quite skeptical because of the age of the book (I though ""Would there be something new for me, would the ideas be still valid?""), after first several pages doubts dissolved and I was entirely caught.

I believe all the reviews have said already enough, so I'll keep my review short. This book has all that I want from it:
- Down-to-earth style without exaggerations. Yet very strong and moving content, explaining how human brain works, what brings us happiness/more life, and how to achieve it.
- Positive :o). Gives reader so much energy into his life.
- No easy-read. Should be read definitely more times than once.

Simply put, this is a must read in the area of self-help/psychology books.

Some of favorite quotes:

""The self-image is changed, for better or worse, not by intellect alone, nor by intellectual knowledge alone, but by ""experiencing."" Wittingly or unwittingly you developed your self-image by your creative experiencing in the past. You can change it by the same method. "" (page x)
""One of the most pleasant thoughts to any human being is the thought that he is needed, that he is important enough to help and add to the happiness of some other human being."" (page 97)

""Since man is a goal striving being, he is functioning naturally and normally when he is oriented toward some positive goal and striving toward some desirable goal. Happiness is a symptom of normal, natural functioning and when man is functioning as a goal-striver, he tends to feel fairly happy, regardless of circumstances."" (page 101)

""Our habits are not accidental, or happenstance. We have them because they fit us. They are consistent with our self-image and our entire personality pattern. When we consciously and deliberately develop new and better habits, our self-image tends to outgrow the old habits and grow into the new pattern. "" (page 108)

""To give the other person credit for being sincere, if mistaken, rather than willful and malicious, can do much to smooth out human relations and bring about better understanding between people. Ask yourself, ""How does this appear--to him?"" ""How does he interpret this situation?"" ""How does he feel about it?"" Try to understand why he might ""act the way he does."""" (page 115)

""Man maintains his balance, poise, and sense of security only as he is moving forward--or seeking. When you think of yourself as having attained the goal, you become static, and you lose the security and equilibrium you had when you were moving towards something. The man who is convinced that he is ""good"" in the absolute sense, not only has no incentive to do better, but he feels insecure because he must defend the sham and pretense."" (page 137)

""Regardless of your feelings, force yourself to mix and mingle with other people. After the first cold plunge, you will find yourself warming up and enjoying it if you persist. Develop some social skill that will add to the happiness of other people: dancing, bridge, playing the piano, tennis, conversation. It is an old psychological axiom that constant exposure to the object of fear immunizes against the fear. As the lonely person continues to force himself into social relations with other human beings--not in a passive way, but as an active contributor--he will gradually find that most people are friendly, and that he is accepted. His shyness and timidity begin to disappear. He feels more comfortable in the presence of other people and with himself. The experience of their acceptance of him enables him to accept himself."" (page 139)

""If responding and reacting to negative feedback does not take us further down the road to our own goal--or serve our ends, then there is no need to respond at all. And, if response of any kind gets us off course, or works against us--then no response is the appropriate response."" (page 199)

""If life adapts itself in so many varied forms to act as a means toward an end, is it not reasonable to assume that if we place ourselves in the sort of goal-situation where more life is needed, that we will receive more life?"" (page 261)",7

Right now while you are thinking about it. The sooner you get it, the sooner you will benefit from its simple effective techniques.

It costs [very little money] and if applied even a little bit, it is likely to change your life. How many other things that cost [this little] can you say that about.
The original edition DID change MY life about 10 years ago and I know at least 5 other people who point to this book (and another classic-Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill) as major keys to their personal philosophy and success in life.
This revised edition is even better than the original due to the care put into it by Dan Kennedy, who is keeping Dr. Maltz's work alive for the present generation with this timely update.
I liked it so much I have bought 5 more copies for some great business associates as gifts.

Put the techniques that have made many ordinary people appear to be extraordinary to work for you. You don't have to work harder, you just need to apply these amazing principals to your current methods and your will be so much more effective.
I also highly recommended ""Zero Resistance Selling"" for sales persons as a companion to this book which specializes the same techniques to Sales careers.",9

After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to buy this book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I've had the book for one week now and I am already seeing results.
About 3 years ago I entered into the world of sales and all of a sudden I became painfully aware of my self-image or my self-esteem as others call it. I became very self-conscious and started down a slippery slope into the world of negative thinking and emotions that weren't helping me at all.
So I did what any person would do who wants to overcome their limiting beliefs and learn how to overcome negative thinking and I started buying self-help litereature. my library is chocked full of books from all the greats. Well I learned something from all the books that I read, but I just felt there was always something missing. I didn't feel like I had the information that I needed to really turn it all around. I tried ""Affirmations"" etc. with marginal results.
Then I found this book. Maxwell talks about how we act, feel and perform is in direct relation to how we imagine ourselves to be. You may need to read that last sentence again because it's what helped me to start putting it all together. He then gives techniques for changing your self-image and overcoming your negative thinking that really works.
I'm very grateful to Maxwell for writing this book. He really put his heart into it and made a masterpiece!
Please don't make the mistake of not buying this book. It could well be the best money you ever spent! God Bless!",21

There are stories and additional paragraphs of information that you're not quite sure what to do with and it clouds the original ideas.

LindaT,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",A Good Thing Made Even Better,"I heard about the first PSYCHO CYBERNETICS book in the 60's (yes, I am over 21 years old) and when I read it I thought it was wonderful. In fact, I thought that if I only would be able to have one self-help book, it would be this one.
THE NEW PSYCHO CYBERNETICS has taken a good book and made it even better. The masterful editing and adapting by Dan Kennedy is great. It still is done in the voice of the original author, Dr. Maxwell Maltz, but it has up to date examples of people most of us know from this time in history, yet it still includes the examples Dr. Maltz wrote about in his original book.
The theme hasn't changed -- Dr. Maltz claimed that the human mind has a ""servo-mechanism"" which can help us accomplish what we desire, but we must let it do its work once the desire is ""fed into"" the mind. He drew upon his knowledge of the then fledgling work of computers. And now in the 21st century, computers have advanced in an unbelievable manner, and yet the principle behind which they work is still the same; the goal-striving mechanism which works towards its teleological end by negative feedback, correction, and positive feedback.
I have other self help books, but for me, this one is the basis on which all the others are carried out.
I can't recommend it highly enough.",23

N/A,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life","Solid, Disciplined ""Self-Improvement"" Book","Unlike many other New Age type books which talks about self-elevating, self-magnificating, self-actualising, self-meditative and all that crap, this book gives some good solid ground rules on creating a strong positive mindset that will help one better oneself with practice.
This book is a modern treatment of Maltz's original book and has made it even more palatable and applicable in daily life. The exercises are simple, straightforward and effective. One just needs to practice.
You're not reading this book to be enlightened to salvation or something (which you can read the Holy Bible for!) but rather, this book prepares your mind to set goals in the daily routine of life. It is about setting goals, and consciously thinking how you could achieve them, letting your subconscious autopilot ""servo-mechanism"" help you on the way there through deliberate practical exercises. This book is even more readable than the original.
Very readable, very practical, and no ""mind power"" mystical nonsense. Just straight cut practical tips to sharpen the mind.",12
Ramon Acosta,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",The first and foremost,"Without a doubt, Dr. Maltz' classic is still on top of the heap of self-help books, tapes and seminars available. Everything that was relevant in late 1950 and early 1960 is still relevant today. Unless humans fundamentally change the way the brain operates, this book will be a classic text on the process of communicating with and reprogramming the inner self.

There's only one downside about this book. If you don't try the mental techniques, nothing will change. You might manufacture a new line of thinking after absorbing the material, but if you don't practice and apply it on a near daily basis, then you've merely read one of the greatest psychology texts of all time. A bit of mental elbow grease will instead allow you to experience this book and the profound change you and your loved ones can all potentially benefit from.",7

This updated version is even better! I especially liked the PRESCRIPTION and MENTAL TRAINING EXERCISE boxes that Mr. Kennedy has strategically placed throughout the book. They contain very clear suggestions and practical exercises for living an abundant and fulfilling life. For example, he prescribes keeping a ""success diary"" as a tool for building a stronger self-image. And on page 201, there is an powerful exercise for developing the all important habit of forgiveness.
One of the insights Dr. Maltz gave me that helped clarify my own life journey was his understanding that our unconscious minds cannot distinguish between a real experience and the same experience vividly imagined. Years later I found confirmation for this idea in Quantum Physics.
Nobel Prize winning Physicist Niels Bohr's Complementarity Principle shows us that the mental aspect of an imagined experience is complementary to its physical aspect. Both are equally 'real'. No wonder imagination and visualization are such valuable skills to master for anyone who wants to transform their dreams into physcial reality.
I wonder if Dr. Maltz and Dr. Bohr ever had a conversation!
Dan Kennedy has done a tremendous favor for anyone who wants knowledge and practical applications for being more successful. I applaud his efforts.",38

Ken Nuehs,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",Unlocked My Success Mechanism,"As of last night, I finished the most amazing book called Psycho Cybernetics, by Maxwell Maltz. I am proud to say this is the first book that I have completed all the way through in over a year. I bought this book back in 2009 when I was fighting the boredom in Iraq and remember only reading a few chapters. After I learned that it was a recommended reading by some of the leaders in Empower Network, I decided to dust it off and see how the top earners have used this book to unlock their success mechanisms and start living a more fulfilling life.

And boy, I'm glad I did!

This powerful book has provided so much value to my life. I now know the power of imagination and have started to imagine successful outcomes when going through a sales presentation, public speaking presentations, and any areas of my life that I'm not completely comfortable and confident in.

And let me tell you the concepts in Psycho Cybernetics works!

I've had my best month in personal training sales at the gym with over $3,000 in sales in just the first 3 weeks. One sale worth $1,950. My previous best was $1,800 for the full month.

A User,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",Better Than the Original; Max Would Have Been Proud,"Greetings:
Join us at the Psycho-Cybernetics discussion group on [...]
To date, I have bought three hardcover editions of the New Psycho-Cybernetics (NPC): one I gave to a friend, one I take with me to read during the day, and one I keep in my home office to work with on those days when I work at home. I have found it a significant improvement upon the original. (I have used up three paperback versions of the original over the last 10 years.)
I remember when I first read the original version of PC, in around 1990. I thought it was somewhat hokey. I used to be an engineer, and I thought it somewhat strange to try to apply feedback control systems theory to people. We are not machines, after all.
The strange thing, though, was that the system worked for me. Still, I was somewhat embarrassed about the whole thing, so I sort of kept my dabbling to myself.
Then, in the mid-late nineties, I read Fritjof Capra's book, The Web of Life. In that book, Capra talks a lot about systems theory, and he also goes into the history of the original cybernetics group (not Psycho cybernetics, but rather a group of mathematicians, psychologists, biologists, and physicists who collaborated in WWII to create anti-aircraft guns that could effectively track and destroy enemy aircraft). In his discussion, Capra explains that the original cybernetics group's goal was to try to make machines that could do what people and animals do naturally and easily, without conscious thought. They tried to do this, in part, by observing the actions of animals and people. Based on such observation, the group devised the early foundation of what became our modern science of systems control as used in almost every modern electrical/mechanical system.
What Maltz tried to do was take a bit of the science and art of systems control and apply it back to people, in an attempt to improve their functioning. I think one of the original cyberneticists, Norbert Weiner, also tried to do this in his book, The Human Use of Human Beings, but I could be wrong.
Anyway, because Psycho-Cybernetics is based on systems theory, in contrast to other types of ""self help"" or positive thinking books, it recognizes that a person trying to achieve her goals is going to fail, and miss what she is pursuing, probably many times on her way to her destination. Rather than candy coating this fact and suggesting ""positive thinking,"" PC suggests feedback control system oriented techniques to use, deal with, and not be completely stymied by such failures.
It also provides techniques to help one deal with ""drama queen"" co-workers and supervisors who seem to go out of their way to provide damaging negative feedback (e.g., ignoring negative feedback in ch. 11, ""How to Unlock Your Real Personality""), or retarding how fast responds to negative feed back (e.g., delaying the response, as in ch. 12 ""Do It Yourself Tranquilizers that Bring Peace of Mind."").

Now, on to the new version of PC: my own opinion is that it is better than the original. Dan follows the original structure of the PC book, and much of the text is in common. However, Dan has buttressed that text with additional examples taken from the many hours of recordings and reams of Maltz' notes that Dan owns. In addition, Dan also provides many practical examples of the successful application of PC techniques that have arisen since the original version of the book was published in 1960.
Try NPC. If, like me, you have areas in your life where you would like to do better, I think you will find it useful.",48

Susil Manchanayaka,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",Understand Yourself,"I bought this book and read it. It is interesting for many reasons. I am a lover of books and I am married to books (metaphorically). Why I say that this book is interesting is that it is life changing. The few dollars I spent on this book is worth and I learnt a lot by reading this book. The chapters are shorter and easy to grasp. Some ideas may be unfamiliar to a novice reader but if you are an experienced and an avid reader, you can get at the gist of the book.

Many people have complexes (psychological) and they struggle to come out of the shell they live in. This book helps you to see the world as it is and you can transform your life with ideas from the book. The ideas in the book are worth remembering and practicing. If you are into understanding the nature of human mentality, behavior and why people do certain things but why they are afraid of doing certain things is interesting. In our lives we undergo numerous pains and we sometimes become depressed and helpless. This book helps anyone to see the world as it is.

The writer is an experienced professional in his field and particularly this book helps one to be motivated, enthusiastic in anything she does and develop confidence. He is a leading scholar and a much respected counselor. I read about his biography on the net and I was very impressed. He is an authority on his subject. I can say that this book is a booster - it boosts your performance. It is light reading.

Maltz takes the reader into an unexplored area of human mentality, how to overcome fears, the basis of fear and personal development. He helps the reader overcome fears. He argues that most of the fears we have are all baseless and unscientific. Fears come out of ignorance. Fears come out of wrong perceptions we have. Fears come out of not being exposed to the world we live in. That is what he says.

The book is pocket sized and you can carry it when you travel. It is like a handbook on personal development. If you have any interest in mentoring, counseling, public speaking or teaching, this is the next book you may consider reading.

I personally like the ideas in the book. The time you may spend will be worth the trouble you take to read this book. The chapters in it are short and run into a couple of pages and at a single sitting you can read a chapter. Make this book a partner in your life. It is worth buying and keeping in your private library. In life one may experience ups and downs. Tribulations in life are part of human existence on this planet. We seek advice from others, counselors, teachers or if you belong to a profession of respect - mentors. This book is a companion mentor. If you are in need of some expert advice, consult this book.

N/A,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",bizzare...,"My big problem with this book is the material that Dan Kennedy added. While it provides useful background and some updated examples, Kennedy weaves it in seemlessly into the old material. What you get is confusion. The first person of Kennedy is mixed in with the first person of Maltz, without being differentiated in any way! So in the same section, you have someone speaking of ""my patients"" in the '40's or '50's, and then the same voice speaking of ""my experiences"" with a Kevin Costner movie or a Michael Jordan anecdote. There is no change in typeface, or paragraph structure to indicate that different people are writing, one long-dead, the other alive and ""editing"" this book. Why didn't Kennedy's editor make him place his commentary separately?
This was enough to spoil most of the usefulness of this edition for me. I suggest noting the boxed exercises that Kennedy includes, which are useful, and then reading the original of the book.",53

Jon Torodash,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",A pioneer in the field still standing strong,"I don't make it a habit to read self-help books, but the off-color fitness guru Matt Furey has made a killing on selling a program based off of Maltz's work, and most other ""motivational speakers"" usually bend a knee in respect to Maltz as a forerunner. So I picked up a cheap used copy and read it cover to cover. The only question I have left is why anyone would bother with any of the other crap. This book effectively condenses the entirety of the self-help field. As far as I can tell, this is as good as it gets by the standards of the genre, is enjoyably accessible to a general audience, and has weathered time's attack on its relevance stunningly well.

Firstly, Maltz had the raw clinical experience necessary to write this kind of book. As a crackerjack plastic surgeon he saw immediately and firsthand the life-changing or life-stalling power of self-image at work in the faces of his patients. (And anyone who scoffs at unorthodox contributors to a research field ought to know that Albert Einstein was working for the Swiss patent office when he submitted the Theory of Special Relativity.) Yet Maltz also admits where exactly the limits of his knowledge lie rather than try to convince the reader of his omniscience.

Secondly, Maltz was receptive to many fundamental tenets of psychology and philosophy and works them into Psycho Cybernetics clearly and without contradiction. Nor does he try to repackage ancient metaphysical hokum with inane and feeble examples.

Thirdly, there are no workshops, special reports, live phone help, or products to buy. (Though I cannot speak for the organization that has cropped up around Maltz's name.) All pretense and exaggeration for marketing purposes seem absent from his book.

Maltz was definitive and unequivocal in his ideas, quick to set a standard and stick to it. He took seriously some very fundamental issues of life and makes clear statements. This book rises high above the haphazard pop philosophy/ethics smeared all over mass media which are either shallow and weak or imperiously stupid. Maltz simply faced the truth of his own convictions. Psycho Cybernetics by no means outlines life management skills as an exact science, but its frank suggestions are intellectually compelling. Overall, the book is worthwhile because Maltz' honest and non-condescending style at least earns your respect, if not your belief.",467

Each chapter seemed to ramble on and on. It is a lengthy book and it seems like a lot of the chapter content was redundant saying the same thing over. The book discusses one's self image, happiness, success and how to evaluate it in life.

The author has a section about SUCCESS (sense of direction, understanding, courage, charity, esteem, self confidence and self acceptance). However each of these bullet points were very basic principles. Same applies to his chapter on FAILURE (frustration, aggressiveness, insecurity, lonliness, uncertainty, resentment and emptiness). Again, very basic material.

For me the last third of the book was more boring than the other two-thirds. It was a hard book to finish being so uninteresting. I can't recommend this book.",6

Christian Rosenkreutz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Psycho-Cybernetics, A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life",Outdated psuedo-science,"I consider myself to be pretty open-minded, especially in regards to the potentials of the human mind, but this book actually reads like a laundry list of little ""fixes"" to do with your life, and reads more like a precursor to infomercial formats than to gaining any kind of insight whatsoever.

The author declares right away that he is not a psychologist, but considers himself qualified (and believe me, I am not a fan of the word ""qualified"" by any means) and continues to compare himself to Einstein, Madam Curie, Wright Brothers (should I have to mention all of their minds actually created advances that changes the entire world without question?) all in the preface, before you even get to the table of contents, which I will briefly list a few entries:

""your key to a better life""

""the success mechanism within you""

""first key to success mechanism""

""dehypnotize yourself""

""let your success mechanism work for you""

""habit of happiness""

""success-type personality""

""failure mechanism""

""how to give yourself an emotional facelift""

""do-it-yourself tranquilizers that bring peace of mind""

I won't go any further, although there are more. My problem is that not only is this self-proclaimed ""scientist/psychologist"" coining new terms, he does it in a very QVC way. I am all for understanding the programming we submit ourselves to, and ways to understand the mind, and patterns of thought, however this book is a waste of time, only for the mindless reader that in fact turns off their brain to read this book (the author actually asks you to do that while reading, its in one of the first chapters, right after he tries to convince the reader that ""telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition have been established by scientific laboratory experiments."" That is the actual sentence from page 24. I would be delighted by nothing more than to get ahold of these ""scientific laboratory experiments"" data records to see this for myself.

The rest is filled with case studies that have bee refuted, ideas that are no longer valid and lots, and lots of God talk.

Instead of posing questions about what needs to come and pondering on the advancements that will be achieved by science he just simply states ""God made you this way now be happy with it.""

Phred,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Computer and the Brain (The Silliman Memorial Lectures Series),Something of a historical curiosity,"Perhaps more so than Alan Turing, (If we accept the intro by Kirtzweil, a man with serious credentials), John von Neuman was one of the most important figures in developing the basic architecture of the modern digital computer. The two did work together, but von Neuman was the senior and I propose had a better grasp of the juncture of math and machine.
The Computer and the Brain is the last published work by von Neuman and was an attempt to bring together what was known about the machine qualities of the brain and what the machines of 1957 might one day be able to accomplish.
As such almost everything is dated and new discoveries in neuroscience more so than in computers place limits on the absolute value of his comments.

That said, there was a head line in recent science news that there is a prototype computer in testing that combines both digital and large scale parallel computing in the manner von Neuman suggests as the model for how the brain may work.

The Computer and the Brain is the printed from of a lecture. He was too ill (mortally) for the series he was offered to conduct. So great was the respect for the man that he was allowed to present only these papers, sufficient for one lecture and about 3 hours reading. I do not think he read the paper; he had just the strength to write it.

Besides having been a vitally important mathematician, he was active in the cause of scientific ethics and as the man who drafted the letter, signed by Einstein credited with America committing to atomic research he is therefore a originator of the atomic age. He was a man of great thought and influence.
Reading this book is a chance to listen to a great mind. I make no claim to have understood all of it. I suspect that no one should read it in an effort to be at the leading edge of math, computers or neurology. It is a hard, but worth it read, and a glass into our recent history.",4
Capecoddan,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Computer and the Brain (The Silliman Memorial Lectures Series),History lesson,"The book is mildly interesting from an historical perspective about what von Neumann was thinking about before he died, but really not that useful from a neuroscience point of view.",2
I am falling in love with my life,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,More difficult to read than I thought,"Imagine that you spend a vacation in Thailand and you see several thousands of fireflies along a river bank, where each of them flashes periodically. Before long, you will observe that they flash in union and periodically for a long time. It is known that when some proper conditions are satisfied, females who live together have a tendency to menstruate at the same time. If you hang two pendulums from hooks embedded in the same wooden beam and separate them not too long, then you will see that they move in sympathy: they swung precisely opposite to each other. When one sounded tick, the other would sound tock. We see here a spontaneous order.

""The laws of thermodynamics seem to dictate the opposite that nature should inexorably degenerate toward a state of greater disorder (p1)"". But as we have seen, ""nature has somehow managed to assemble themselves (p1)"".

In the above examples, the individuals oscillate in time. Two or more oscillators are said to be coupled if some physical or chemical process allows them to influence one another (p3). Using this language, we can say that the coupled oscillators synchronized themselves.

In this book, Steven Strogatz asks the following questions: How exactly do coupled oscillators synchronize themselves, and under what conditions? When is sync impossible and when is it inevitable? (p3)

1950s - Norbert Wiener was interested in the alpha rhythm of brain waves, 10 cycles a second. He argued that the frequency (10 cycles a second) comes from millions of brain cells of diverse frequency. The distribution of the diverse frequencies will be the bell shape that is highest at 10 (the normal distribution curve) if there is no coupling. But by some coupling, only the frequency 10 is distinguished. And he suggested a concrete frequency distribution (peak at 10) with the coupling.

Since there was no accurate equipment to prove his prediction, the confirmation had to be left to later researchers. And he guessed that such coupling would be quite universal. For example, he thought that synchronized croaking frogs and flashing fireflies are such phenomena.

1960s - Art Winfree considered groups of different kinds of things instead of identical things of different frequencies. If the population in the group is extremely diverse (inhomogeneous), then sync will not happen. If the populations are clones, then sync happens. They are obvious facts. We can expect that the amount of sync will increase as the homogeneity of the populations increases. What Winfree found was that there is a critical point such that the amount of sync never happens until the homogeneity of population increases to the point, and that the amount of sync surges abruptly after that point. It's like that at 0 degree, ice melt into water.

1970s - Winfree obtained his results by simulation. If mathematicians try to treat the above fundamental problems, they will think about some models that are abstraction of real things in nature. (For mathematicians, what else is possible?) Japanese physicist Yoshiki Kuramoto constructed a simpler, mathematical model, and he mathematically proved (but with some gaps) what Winfree did. Winfree and Kuramoto's works partially vindicated Wiener's claim in the sense that the sync happens under the condition that the oscillators are sufficiently homogeneous.

1980s - If we consider groups of different kinds of things instead of being interested in the same kind of individual things as Winfree did, then we can ask about the stability of the state of the groups. If the state of the groups is, say X, and if we perturb the groups a little bit, then would the state remain the same X? If so, the state is called stable, if not, called unstable.

Steven Strogatz solved a long standing problem about stability of sync at some point of homogeneity of populations near the critical point. His answer is that it is neutrally stable (jargon).

The book was more academic and difficult than I thought. I think that the book is difficult than Chaos by Gleick. For some chapters, if you are not familiar with the Gleick's book, you may have difficulty to read the chapters. And the language can be an obstacle to read. I am not a native English speaker and not so familiar with English other than my area. Retina, circadian, marvel, sympathy, speck, in union, etc, if you need to look up these words in a dictionary, then the book will be hard for you as it was to me.

The most appropriate readers for the books seem to be serious college students who study science and hope to be a researcher in this area, dynamical systems. If you are not so much eager to learn about dynamical systems, then the book can be boring because it deals with too many areas like biological clock (biology), superconductivity (physics), cryptography (information theory), BZ reaction (chemistry), etc even before the first two thirds of the book. I stopped reading from there. The author is known for a very skillful writer and I totally agree to that. But its coverage is too diverse.

The author majored in mathematics in college and studied biological mathematics in graduate school. One of the good points for me was that I realized that biological mathematics can be my interest (I am a pure mathematician who is interested in physics). When I read at an article that these days the famous geometer Mikhail Gromov studies biological mathematics, I wondered why he studies such things of different nature with geometry. Now I can understand.

The book quotes a phrase from the book 'The Geometry of Biological Time' by A. Winfree: ""From cell division to heartbeat, clocklike rhythms pervade the activities of every living organism. The cycles of life are ultimately biochemical in mechanism but many of the principles that dominate their orchestration are essentially mathematical.""

Strogatz says that ""The players are different, but their abstract patterns of interaction are the same (p65)."", or ""The sympathy of clocks taught us that the capacity for sync does not depend on intelligence, or life, or natural selection. It springs from the deepest source of all: the laws of mathematics and physics (p108).""

Many physicists believe that there are mathematical principles that govern the universe. Similarly, I learned that there can be mathematical principles that govern the universe especially for the living beings.

There are many interesting scientific researches in the book. One of them is the experiments on the sleep cycle of human beings. It claims that there are forbidden zones in the sleep cycle such that at the period people can never sleep deeply. But I don't agree to the result. From my own experience, I know that I can sleep well at any time if I was awake more than 24 hours and I had peace in my mind then.",2
Apollocoyuz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Science fiction fun comprised of science facts,"As an intelligence analyst educated as a patent lawyer I appreciate the very narrow cadre of scientists who write well. Dr. Strogatz is definitely in that category with Isaac Asimov and other scientifically educated authors who have a gift for the pen. Right from the get-go he relieves the non-technical reader of any anxiety that he will employ formulas in his work. In choosing to use analogies he broadens his audience considerably. He selects fireflies pulsing in sync as one of the first examples and this resonated with me as it is something I look forward to seeing every year on my bike commute in Dayton, Ohio.

This book reminded me of _Be Here Now_ in the way that a classically educated author brings a sense of wonder and mysticism to phenomena we scientific mysteries we all witness in our daily lives. I found it while reading on Dr.Vytas SunSpiral's NASA page as he mentions it as an inspiration for his research.

In my humanities courses as an undergraduate literature was often included in the syllabus but it never occurred to me until reading this work that engineering courses should have a lit. component. If you are a Calculus, Chemistry, or Physics instructor at the University level, or an Intellectual Property Law Professor I would encourage you to consider this book as required reading.",1
B. Case,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Challenging and fascinating,"This book formed the basis of a discussion group consisting of eight two-hour sessions. The members of our discussion group were mostly accomplished seniors retired from professions that required doctorate or masters degrees (e.g., aerospace engineers, doctors, physicists, mathematicians, technology professors, librarians, science teachers, etc.). About a third of us had no significant academic science backgrounds, just high intelligence, strong intellectual curiosity, and an abiding love for science.

I must say that all of us without a strong academic science background found the class difficult. The book was always fascinating but also complex and at times quite difficult to follow. The hardcore scientists in the class were often very frustrated with the book’s lack of supporting math and graphs. But I’m sure everyone in the class would agree that the book did provide a suitable framework for learning about this topic in a mixed group from different academic backgrounds. Personally, coming from a humanities background, I found it extremely useful that our class contained a number of Ph.D. scientists who were able to explain some of the more difficult concepts in a manner that enhanced my understanding.

I found the book enjoyable to read but definitely challenging. It opened my mind to a whole new world on nonlinear mathematics. I love to stretch my mind and this book and class did exactly that.

Each of us had to do a forty-five-minute PowerPoint presentation for the rest of the class on a topic related to the book. I choose the synchronization found within the pacemaker cells of the heart. I was thrilled by this independent study topic and learned a great deal that was useful to me in my personal life. I would never have taken the time to explore in detail the detailed functioning of the human heart had it not been for the challenge of reading this book and taking this class. I am very grateful I did both.",2
Randolph Eck,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Interesting Discussion of Synchronization in Our World,"In this book written by Steven Strogatz, professor of applied mathematics at Cornell University, we learn, as the subtitle of the book states, ""How order emerges from chaos in the universe, nature, and daily life."" The book is divided into three main sections.

In the first section on ""Living Sync"", Strogatz discusses synchronization in living creatures: the synchronization of fireflies, and the work done on coupled oscillators which was an attempt to determine how the flies could sync their flashes. The discussion on how oscillators might work together continues with brain waves and the biological clock. I found the information about the research on how the biological clock works very interesting. It is fascinating how thousands of neurons in an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nuclei act as oscillators and how this ""collective electrical rhythm of the pacemaker is conveyed [...] to the peripheral oscillators in the liver, kidney, and other organs throughout the body, disciplining them to run at the same period as the master clock."" Thus, in nature, we see the mechanisms for sync.

In the second section we learn that ""the capacity for sync does not depend on intelligence, or life, or natural selection."" Strogatz notes instead that it springs from what he calls the deepest source of all, and that is the laws of mathematics and physics. These laws explain why the moon has what's called a 1:1 spin-orbit resonance (we always see the same side of the moon) and why there are these gaps in the asteroid belt called Kirkwood gaps. Shrinking things down to the quantum level, we are introduced to the weirdness of superconductivity and the Josephson junction with its rapidly oscillating supercurrent across an insulating junction - certainly strange stuff at this level.

In the 1960's and 1970s, we had the pioneers of sync, such as Wiener, Winfree, Kuramoto, Peskin, and Josephson; Strogatz expands on the work of all these individuals. He speaks of them as ""blazing one path up the mountain, on the trail of spontaneous order in enormous systems of oscillators."" Now we are introduced, in the next section, to something called synchronized chaos, and here we have an army of new individuals ""clambering up a separate trail but headed for the same peak."" We are taken into the strange world of this so-called chaos, which refers to a state that appears random but is set in motion by deterministic laws - predicable in the short run but unpredictable in the long run. Here we are in a world of space states, strange attractors, Lyapunov time, and nonlinearity, but as Strogatz notes ""Chaos can sync."" There is some exploration of sync in three dimensions before delving into the subject of complex networks. These are very important because ""If the day should ever come that we understand how life emerges from a dance of lifeless chemicals, or how consciousness arises from billions of unconscious neurons, that understanding will surely rest on a deep theory of complex networks."" Particular attention is paid to something called small-world networks. The question is whether or not oscillators connected in such a network can sync more easily that a traditional network. These networks are common in our world: the Internet backbone, the primate brain, metabolic reactions in a cell, even the structure of the English language.

Strogatz concludes indicating that sync has been an elementary part of nonlinear science, and offers insights into such diverse things as cardiac arrhythmias, superconductivity, sleep cycles, the power grid and more. Being grounded in rigorous mathematical ideas, it is important in a wide range of cooperative behavior in living and nonliving entities from the quantum to the cosmic. Where it all goes, only time will tell.",1
C.Hooten,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Wonderful!,"Even though it was written a little more than a decade ago, this volume has a tremendous amount of relevant and fascinating information. Strogatz has conversational style, a way of conveying difficult concepts and complicated theories in ways that make sense, and even better, allow the reader to experience at least some of the emotion that must go with truly original discoveries, or the satisfaction of finding the solution as predicted b the math. Mercifully, there is scarcely an equation or mathematical expression in the entire book, and the few illustrations are clear and to the point. He is conversant in a good many disciplines, and so draws from a broad range of examples. For anyone interested in the breakthrough scientific concepts of the last several decades, this book will do more than just acquaint you with many of them; it will give you an entertaining and reasonably easy-to-follow insight into some amazing experiments and the outcomes of some very controversial scientific predictions of the recent age. Highly recommended!!",2
gare,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,"A great read about the what, how, and even why every group of 'things'--big or small--manages to function optimally together.","I read this book in two days--could hardly put it down. It's well written, even with a little humor. Very understandable regardless of your professional background. Helps one understand why competition leads to optimal, cooperative, adaptive functioning and even why complexity seems to increase with time. Darn near accounts for the modern day shift from religiosity to what we mean when we talk about spirituality. A couple months after you've read it, glance through it again, and then pass it on to a friend: It'll give the two of you something to talk about. If they do the same, it may even improve the synchronicity of your circle of friends! Thanks for reading this. Gary C. Martin, M.D. Psychiatrist & Psychoanalyst",1
W. Cheung,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Fascinating subject touching a lot of fields,"I am a practising physician and I can say the author is reasonably accurate when he talks about the medical aspect of synchronization (saying that, it is I think an overstatement to say tachycardia can degenerate into lethal arrhythmia called verticular fibrillation - page 210). What is surprising of this book is the breath of fields that it covers: from mathematics, to physics, to chemistry, to biology and then to sociology. I got a clearer idea from this book on the behaviour of bosons than some other books on quantum meachanics. It even teaches me stuffs that I did not know in my field (e.g. the human circadian cycle).

The only thing is that the nature of the subject means that the reader has to concentrate and unite all the themes together his or her own. I feel that the author talks about several rather different types of synchronization and I am not sure whether they can be all unified as a single phenomenon.

In any case, it is a book which is surely informative, fascinating and reasonably accurate. Five stars.",8
A. Panda,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Biology and physics osscillate in Sync according to mathematical equations.,"This is the account of how scientists are looking for Sync, the science of how the world synchronizes itself out of chaos in both the living and nonliving realms, as well as the mathematical laws that rule them. The simplest form of sync is observed in the way how two pendulums synchronize themselves, like two coupled oscillators. The pendulum's motion is ruled by nonlinear dynamics and has become the landmark of chaos theory (almost as much as the butterfly effect), since one cannot predict its motion when it bounces into a chaotic state. (For an easy to read and well explained introduction into this emerging science, read Chaos: Making a New Science). Complexity theory deals with the coupling of more than one oscillator. However Sync not only deals with periodic states (systems that repeat themselves), it can arise from chaotic systems as well. Imagine an orchestra in which all musicians are synchronized even if the music does not repeat itself.

This book explains the main concepts of Chaos and Sync without the maths. The explanation of ""strange attractors"" was extremely good, the idea is transmitted very well. You will also find explanations on supercondictivity, lasers, circadian rythms, heart sync & arrythmias, how lightbugs synchronize and a brief introduction to network theory. This is a very refreshing reading and very easy as well, but full of interesting information.

Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics gives an excellent explanation of complex systems, while Deep Simplicity: Bringing Order to Chaos and Complexity explains the physical and chemical aspects of chaos from an astrophysicist's point of view..",6
Byron Brown,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Totally fascinating and inspiring,"I found this book a true joy to ""read"". I actually listened to it more than read it and was enthralled by the fascinating process of how science unfolds that Strogatz describes. He journeys back and forth in time from one discipline to another as he follows the search for understanding about the synchronization between various elements in our world, from fireflies to heartbeats, sleep cycles to subatomic particles. I very much enjoyed his style of writing as engaging, challenging on the level of ideas and accessible in its humanness. The reader of the audible.com version was very good. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in how our amazing world works, in the magic and mystery of reality.",1
John M. Meyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Fascinating!,"I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I bought this book, but the brief looked interesting and it was only a few bucks. I'm sure glad I decided to check it out. Well-written and thought-provoking, it illuminates the concepts of spontaneous organization, resonance, and chaos theory without a load of heavy mathematics. From fireflies to heart attacks and clocks to jet lag, similar functions are at work all around and within us. Finding out just why and what this means is a great read for anyone who wants to understand how the bits of the world fit together.",1
Sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,"Great, visual, exciting","This book does a great job of using visualisations to explain otherwise incomprehensible processes.

Craig Bardenheuer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Fascinating book. Couldn't put it down!,"I'd been told this was more of a math book than anything else.

R. Hauser,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Heavy Science for Light Readers,"What a fun book. Strogatz has managed to talk about the leading edge of mathematical modeling without a single equation! He uses a comfortable prose and never strays too far from the story of his research. The reader is treated to a view of the way that the world network of scientists organizes itself within areas of research and finds unions where research from one speciality can contribute to another. Who would have thought that the western power grid, the Internet Movie Database and the nervous system of a worm called C. elegans could be effectively modeled with the same operational principles.",6
Edward Early,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Educational and Entertaining,"Sync is one of the most enthralling scientific books I've ever read. As a mathematician, I enjoyed seeing some actual science and cited references rather than just vague generalities. At the same time, the book is very easy to follow through a wide array of subjects. There are parts where you might want to just scratch your head and move on (unless you have an intuition for quantum mechanics), but it would be difficult not to find a lot to like in this book. I was especially interested to learn about the human sleep/wake cycle, others may prefer fireflies blinking in unison, maybe you're more interested in learning where ""six degrees of separation"" really came from, or perhaps you'd like to know why the same side of the moon always faces the earth.

This book is appropriate for motivated high school students through veteran scientists.",9
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Good pop science,"This book is an example of popular science writing. Too much science to be popular, but too popular to be rigorously scientific. I really hoped it would be better; I really hoped for a little more rigour with the science. For example, Dr. Strogatz mentions that the routers in computer networks spontaneously synchronized their message traffic, leading to bursty traffic patterns. I would have liked to have learned more---how the protocols worked, how this problem was discovered, diagnosed and fixed. Or I would at least have liked to know where I could have gone to get more information on the subject. But the episode was written so generally that I can't track down any more information.
I can't help but wonder if some well-meaning but basically ignorant editor cut the science parts, leaving only the pop science writing.
This is a good book about an interesting subject, but it could have been better.",14

Robert D. Crane,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Allocate the time to better understand,"I was a little disappointed in this book I must admit. I found that it perhaps did not go into the all the aspects I was interested in. I also found that since there were so many theories that the authors use of constant analogies tended to confuse rather than clarify the situation.

However, the book and the topic is still very interesting. I also think that you need to have a grasp of mathematics and physics to get the most from the book. There is however plenty to interest those who want to know more about network theory and how it is evident is so many aspects of our world these days.

This is not a book you can simply read before you go to sleep each night. You need to allocate some time and really spend time understanding what the author is trying to get across if you want to get the most from this book.",5

I certainly have, especially my wife who has had trouble sleeping (she is a light sleeper), and of course our kids who tend to get up at 7am on the weekends when we just want to sleep in. It provides great background to many of the parenting tips in magazines like, say, Parenting, and various columns in other places out there.
Strogatz would also get my recommendation above even Feynman in the colorfulness of his writing. Like QED, I sincerely recommend this as an essential for the book shelf. It is simply a great display of the ability to write about a specific subject and includes many various things that very directly relate to it.",2
W. Onkham,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Great book!,"This book provides the different perspective from my common life.

Juan-Pablo Caceres,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Interesting but filled with uninteresting auto-biographical data,"The science covered in this book is really interesting, and at times well explained. However, the author fails to convey harder concepts with a use of metaphors that is really deficient (all the part of subatomic sync is a disaster).

Although some biographical data of the main scientists are informative, most of the ""anecdotes"" that Strogatz provides as context of his own research are really boring, uninteresting, and self-serving. He probably thinks that he makes the books more readable (on top of praising himself) but it's just the opposite, it loses momentum. The book would greatly benefit form an editor that would remove 100+ pages.

In any case, it is still a worth read (you can skim a lot) to get a feeling of how really synchronization works.",7
Mina Wender,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Do not read for a book club,Interesting topic but the mathematical concepts are far beyond the even mathematically inclined.

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Interesting enough book but a bit too full of its own importance,"The book is readable and generally quite interesting.

I have no doubt that the author is an highly talented and well respected researcher, and that the concept of sync is an important and interesting element of the field of complexity. Whether it merits a book of its own is another question.

I can't escape the feeling that the author has taken a relatively simple, albeit important, concept and blown it up into a major ""new"" scientific field, complete with the obligatory and slightly artificial buzzword - Sync. Reading the book one gets the impression that ""Sync"" is on a par with other major scientific discoveries such as DNA and quantum mechanics, and that those participating in the research are opening up brave new frontiers of science which will change the course of mankind.

While I understand the need to ""sell"" the book and its subject, it just doesn't ring true to me.",6
Simeon Hein,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Is There Synchronicity in Sync?,"Sync is a fascinating account of parallel developments in the fields of neurobiology, biochemistry, superconductivity, and network theory that suggest the emergence of a new paradigm based around the ideas of self-organization, chaos, and complexity. As a researcher in subtle-energy science, however, I found ""Sync"" most interesting in the areas where Strogatz refuses to tread. The other reviews on this page do a good job describing the book in detail. I was particularly interested, though, in finding that the person who discovered quantum tunneling, Brian Josephson, a Nobel prize winner in 1973 and one of Strogatz' heroes in the development of sync theory, later turned to the study of telepathy, remote viewing, homeopathy, and related topics. Despite Josephson's credentials, Strogatz dismisses all of the latter's extracurricular interests with a few sweeps of the pen. Telepathy doesn't exist, it's that simple! Then why did an independent study commissioned by the U.S. Congress and performed by statistician Jessica Utts in the 1990's find statistically significant evidence for such a phenomena? And what about the study recently conducted by skeptics in Ireland that found evidence for homeopathy? Isn't science supposed to look at all the evidence? This isn't a question of our personal opinions: it's about the data. Is it scientific to dismiss data that contradicts our personal beliefs?

Thus, while Sync is a spectacular book in some ways, in other ways it displays the rather parochial, narrow-minded views of old-school science. Strogatz asks us to open our minds and at the same time he won't consider the broader-range implications of his subject matter. No remote viewing, no subtle-energy science, no psychokinesis for you: it's not worth considering, not even for a moment. It's a perplexing, contradictory world-view and one that reveals the mechanistic bias of modern science and its practitioners.

(Dr. Simeon Hein is the author of OPENING MINDS: A Journey of Extraordinary Encounters, Crop Circles, and Resonance, and PLANETARY INTELLIGENCE.)",1
M. Schippling,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,more autobiography than science...,"I was rather disappointed in this book after reading the rave reviews. While the author explains his work very clearly and simply the book is more of a biography than a science text. It is an easy and entertaining read, but the links between different sections have more to do with the author's interests than the discovery of an amazingly new fundamental concept, ""Synchronization"".

To his advantage the author is much more gracious with assigning credit for work described here than in at least one other recent book that I will not cite for fear of a libel suit. However there are some gaping holes in his coverage due to his focus on his own collaborations. He does stick to his promise of No Math, except for one curious comment about ""taking the sine function of the probability wave"" that should have jumped off the page and grabbed the editor's red pen.

On the plus side there is an extensive reference section at the back of the book to direct further study. However that section is never referenced anywhere, so I had to stumble on it half way through while looking for something in the index. To my mind, opting for the 'footnotes are confusing' paradigm just made the book seem less useful than it should be.

It was fun while it lasted but I fear that I would have been better of buying one of his real textbooks, even if they are 10 years old by now.",36
Just a guy in Oregon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order,Scratching the surface of universal truth......,"I'd have to disagree with one of the dust jacket reviewers who compared the author with Professor Steven Jay Gould. Sorry Steve, S.J. Gould you are not.

The author is a very accomplished mathematician yet managed to produce this book without resorting to the arcane language of his field. How is this so? I've been told by many engineers ( IEEE members I might add but not anyone who has written 3500 articles ) that certain concepts, relationships, and facts simply cannot be expressed in mere words. Math is required they say-their language is required. Of course, most of these people, unlike Steve Strogatz who has an excellent command of English , have a VERY limited command of any language other than mathematics. Therefore, I wonder to what extent the author would agree that one can never fully comprehend the topic using such a limited language as English. In other words what are those of us who don't speak the language of highly advanced mathematics missing? Or...are we missing anything?

The author does an exceptional job of describing his ideas in the English language and for this I thank him.

I note that, unlike the extraordinary once in a generation scientist Gould, Strogatz apparently could not remove himself from his/our immediate cultural/political setting to a sufficient degree to avoid mentioning bogus politico-science in the same sentence with actual fact. He includes global warming right along with the origin of life and finding a cure for cancer as examples of great mysteries awaiting solution by the science of sync. He should have included it instead in his discussion of ""fads"".

I'd suggest if he considers global warming a proven scientific fact then his list should also include ""scientific creationism"". The final chapter discusses the origin of ""fads"" in human societies and how/why they develop and are accepted so rapidly. He should apply this logical analysis to the phenom of ""global warming"". After reading such an excellent book as this I was disappointed when the author jumped on the bandwagon of contemporary political/scientific orthodoxy in his apparent acceptance of the pseudoscience of global warming.

He, of all people, should understand the hubris involved in believing that we can even begin to understand the complex nonlinear system of global climate well enough to predict global warming on the basis of the very limited and tainted data that is offered as ""proof"" by those many scientists eager for grant funding to develop additional validation of the ""theory"".

Oh well, the author is only human like all of us. For a break from his demanding job of theoretical thinking the author might read a new novel ""State of Fear"". He should pay particular attention to the factual footnotes and the high degree to which the author has incorporated the truths of Chaos/Complexity theory into his writing. Steve, you have a few important things to learn from Michael. I think the two of you are intellectual equals.",11

rebelmomof2,3.0 out of 5 stars,Rebuilt: My Journey Back to the Hearing World,Very Well-Written,"This is a very well-written book but it was very technical and dry in places. I still ordered my own copy of it since the subject matter is an important one for my family.

I have a CI too and I don't consider myself to be a cyborg or part computer. I consider myself lucky and fortunate to be in a time where this is possible. I lost my hearing suddenly before we left for a trip out west to the Rockies at the age of 34 and a young mom of twin boys that were not even two yet. Scary? Oh you betcha. I got mine for a variety of reasons but mainly because I needed to hear. Like the author of this book, I had grown up wearing hearing aids. So getting the implant was a necessity for me and one that I am eternally grateful for.

This book is very interesting in the aspect of technology and how cochlear implant works. This book would be perfect for my husband and dad to read since they love anything technical. But all the references to science fiction turned me off as well as his personal stories about his dating/sex life. I honestly don't care about that so that is why this is rated a three stars instead of a four. If they were trimmed out or modified, then this would be a four.

I really do appreciate the section on how the Deaf Culture changed from the year of 2000 to 2004 (or something like that). I did watch the movie, ""Sound and the Fury"" and for the first time in my life, I had a glimpse of what the Deaf Culture is about (not that I agree with it). This author went into more details (and got me to order more books on that subject) about something that has changed since I was a child. As a mother of a HOH child who may be a candidate for a CI, this book is helpful in sharing information that I may not get otherwise.

This is an interesting book and a great introduction to cochlear implants and how it affects one man's life and how it affects society today. It is a good read and a helpful one.

Mindy Machanic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rebuilt: My Journey Back to the Hearing World,A different kind of technology story,"Mike Chorost tells a story of technology from the perspective of a person who is trying to understand a very human loss - his hearing. He has a unique background for writing this book, because he is a technologist with a humanities background. His book is personal, yet it explains and explores the technology of hearing amplification along the way. When he gets into the more geeky issues around cyborg technologies, unlike some others writing about these issues he maintains the human social context and considers the real social and ethical ramifications, along with the literary contexts. He even sneaks in references to some of our favorite movie and TV characters, although he does misunderstand the Borg concept! Besides his ability to keep the technology issues within a human context, what makes this book particularly relevant and a good read is his allowing his personality to come through, with his foibles and shyness, his tendency to underestimate his own strengths as a seeker of meaning. A refreshing change in a biography! Chorost comes across as very likeable and genuine, and I found myself hoping for him to find not only his hearing, but also to find a girlfriend and a wholeness in his life. An all-around good read.",15

Having been partially deaf from birth Chorost had felt both a yearning to connect to others, and a profound inability to do so. Yet, when he went completely deaf in his fourth decade, and opted to undergo a cochlear implant, the fear, frustration, and struggle to both adapt to his implant, and adapt his implant to himself, precipitated a larger struggle to relate himself to those around him. The book chronicles both the particulars of his personal struggle, and the implications it's meaning in the larger context of the relationship of technology to humanity as a whole. He makes vivid the practical implications of what appear at first to be only abstract ideas regarding the nature of perception and knowledge. A book well worth reading and thinking about.",6

To my own surprise, I devoured this book in a few days. One of the most engaging and satisfying reads I have had in years.

If I was Chorost's editor, I'd have told him to cut a few things & beef up other parts (and particularly told him ""Less about the girls, more about the code""! Chorost seems to have underrated the interesting-ness of his insights as a guy who knows about software and overrated the interest of online dating; cf. ""Genes, Girls and Gamow,"" a similar exercise...). But that said, this is one of the most striking and memorable books I've read for ages. Chorost is the perfect person to write this book, and his insights into the wonders & difficulties of the cochlear implant should be required reading for EVERYBODY who has an interest in biotechnology, language, education, neurology, etc. A real must-read.",6

Studying llfe in New York,5.0 out of 5 stars,Winning Design!: LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Design Patterns for Fun and Competition (Technology in Action),"Great, inclusive book","This book delivers what it promises: winning design. It's especially useful for teams or coaches for First Lego League (FLL). If read thoroughly, it covers just about every detail you'd need to know to get a novice team up and running. If this is your first FLL team, I'd suggest going through before the season starts, or as soon as you get started. It also will even help an experienced team to think in the way that judges are most impressed by when designing your robot. Does it cover every aspect and every possibility for robot design? No. Should it? No. If there were typos, they didn't distract me. I'd consider it high on my list of my reference books for FLL.

Part of the process for FLL IS figuring out how to look at a situation and take an iterative approach to process improvement. This book more than gets you there, if you use the information as a sound jumping off point.

There is some good information in the book. If you're a tinkerer or someone who works with electromechanical things, none of this is earth shattering. (ie It's better to support the axle of a wheel on both sides vs a single side.) If you don't have a mechanical background, I'm sure it would be very helpful.

However the book is maddening to read. On the superficial but still annoying side, misspelling, typos and grammar problems abound and the illustrations are lacking.

The bigger issue is that the author spends waaay too much time on stuff he himself says you'll never need. It's like: ""Here's something that you'll never need in your FLL life and let me spend 8 pages on it."" -- I can't help but wonder how much more good stuff he could have put in the book if he had chopped the stuff he himself says you'll never use.

Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Cybernetic Revolutionaries: Technology and Politics in Allende's Chile (MIT Press),Unfinished Work,"I hesitate giving three stars because such a unique work will doubtless leave me with a valuable and lasting impression. But I feel obligated to bring expectations down to earth given all the four-star reviews.

First of all, the author did an impressive amount of original research. Full stop. Kudos.

However, the book is a Ph.D dissertation in form, if not function. The topic of the dissertation is not Project Cybersyn so much as a general commentary on the intersection of political and technological change, with Project Cybersyn as a sort of passive sounding board. And the thesis? I couldn't honestly tell you. Like Project Cybersyn, the thesis remains out-of-focus and definitely out-of-reach, at least to someone not on her review committee.

As a dissertation, the author spends well over half the book discussing her theoretical analysis of the relationship between politics and technology. And she makes sure her dissertation reviewers never miss any of her points by relentlessly using the journalistic formula--""tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em what you told 'em""--at every level of argumentation; sometimes in the same paragraph; and I could swear in the same sentence. That leaves the casual reader with only a bare thread of historical recounting weaving through the pages.

In the end so very little of the original research comes through relative to the impressive amount of material the author assembled that it was hard not to be disappointed. Fortunately the reader is still left with a considerable amount of objective history to chew on to make the book a worthwhile read.

If the author had sufficient time on her hands, it might be worthwhile to simply rewrite the book properly. With her Ph.D (and dissertation defense) behind her, she can dispense with the vast majority of her commentary, starting with almost every argument and observation up until the last few chapters. That's clearly when she found her feet, anyhow, and when she begins making her most bold and poignant observations. But most importantly, she could fit in much, much more of her research. And then round it out by adding additional historical context, including comparing and contrasting Soviet and other projects--of which I have little insight, much like most readers not in her field of study--which are really only hinted at, with frustrating disclaimers excusing their omission.

Basically, the ratio needs to be reversed. Rather than cherry picking details to pepper the commentary, the author should craft a concise and concrete narrative to accompany a more substantive recounting of the history. Because Project Cybersyn was prematurely ended, and almost immediately fell short of the original vision, it would be necessary to expand the scope of historical context, which would be fine by me.",9

SRenan,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Cyborg Handbook,"Indispensable Anthology Offers Best Overview of Cyborg Origins, Unique Interviews + Seminal Texts","This classic anthology, first published in 1995, remains the definitive collection of material covering the history, culture and academic consideration of cyborgs. For me, the most impressive accomplishment of The Cyborg Handbook is the inspiration with which Chris Hables Gray shapes many divergent views of cyborgs into a coherent recognition of life entering a radical new stage of evolution.

I admit to being seduced from the first page by the extraordinary language and vision of Donna Haraway's Foreward -- ""Cyborgs and Symbionts: Living Together in the New World Order"". Of course if you are new to cyborg texts, her words may feel more like ""a warning shot fired 'cross your bow"". In a style that is wildly and poetically evocative, Haraway introduces the impossibly high stakes strategy of merging biologies with technologies in the service of survival. She suggests it may be the only strategy that can sustain our species (while also possibly altering us forever.) ""This handbook"", Haraway explains, ""is a valuable guide to the cyborg worlds we willy-nilly inhabit, whether we want to or not.""

The Cyborg Handbook offers us 43 separate pieces published between 1960 and 1995. Gray has staged them in a narrative arc that tracks emergence of ""the cyborg impulse"" resulting from a global convergence of biologies, histories and technologies. Mythological & metaphorical models for cyborgs appear long before technologies arrive to enable it. It is the space program and the demands of modern warfare, as well as increasingly intrusive medical practices, that finally make inevitable the technological augmentation of biology. Perhaps most exciting is the special view provided of ""the cyborg genesis"" via interviews with pioneer engineers as well as the papers and reports they wrote. From there, this book documents the growing proliferation of cyborg memes in space, in war, in medicine and in imagination production. It goes on to introduce the future with texts on cyborg anthropology and cyborg politics. And now... 20 years after it was first published, with augmented realities and augmented identities rapidly becoming the new normal, The Cyborg Handbook seems more relevant than ever. And while editor Gray has carefully avoided the sensationalism that stains other cyborg-themed book, we must now recognize a reality more shocking, more radical, and more future-altering than any story about the Star Trek humans facing The Borg. I mean (with apologies to Walt Kelly and Pogo) that we have seen The Borg and they is us.

The Cyborg Handbook, though compelling, is not exactly an easy read. Cyborgs were (and still are) a comparatively new subject. I had the sense of multiple new vocabularies being created in front of me as I read -- sort of like taking a train trip on a railroad while it is still being built. Plus there is the thud factor -- 560 pages, 54 of them the index. I found it necessary to allow myself extra time to work through the multiples voices and vocabularies of the diverse and divergent texts. I had an especially hard time navigating the post-modern, poly-syllabic worded socialist/marxist/feminist academic texts. I was thankful for Alan Hill's playful and edgy book design that added visual adventure to often-dry text.

And there are disappointments. Missing, for example, is Donna Haraway's iconic 1985 text ""A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century"". You can still buy it on Amazon in several books by Haraway -- in The Haraway Reader as well as Haraway's Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature.

If you prefer a more reader-friendly introduction to cyborgs -- one you can read in hours instead of days -- I highly recommend Amber Case's An Illustrated Dictionary of Cyborg Anthropology -- just out and also available through Amazon. But even that book, in a list at the end, recommends you also read Chris Hablas Gray's The Cyborg Handbook. And for good reason. There is no other book like it.",4

Engineer Always Learning,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory (Information Science and Statistics),New to Field of Learning Theory,"I am relatively new to statistical learning theory, though with a solid background in supporting theories and a Master's in Engineering. I found the text readable. I appreciate the historical perspective and the development of concepts by the author. I was generally able to grasp Vapnick's theories and explanations, though often after rereading passages many times.

Simple examples would significantly aid the readability and understandability of the text - akin to the way we teach our children. We don't describe all the attributes of a rabbit, we point to a picture of a rabbit and say ""bunny"". After two or three examples of this my children know the abstract concept of a rabbit (without me having to describe a small, four legged creature with long ears, etc. and then answering the inevitable question of ""What's four legged creature mean daddy?""). Particularly with a text about learning theory, one would think it would be full of such examples - at least from a pedagogical point of view.

Initially, I didn't mind Vapnick's editorializing, but after a while I find it annoying - I'm sure he didn't single-handedly invent the entire field of statistical learning theory, but he sure doesn't miss any opportunities to tell the reader that he believes he has.",2
Dr. Terrence McGarty,3.0 out of 5 stars,Rebel Genius: Warren S. McCulloch's Transdisciplinary Life in Science (MIT Press),A Good First Step,"Warren McCulloch was one of the several thinkers in the field of what was and to some degree still is called Cybernetics. Norbert Wiener was the shining star when I first became exposed to the ideas in the early 60s at MIT and McCulloch by that time was I believe located at the other end of my building, Building 20, along with his colleague such as Jerry Letvin. Whereas Wiener was a mathematician and philosopher and also a sometimes engineer, McCulloch was a physician and philosopher and a sometimes neurophysiologist. The period between the 1940s and the mid 1960s saw an explosion in applying mathematics to various physical phenomenon. Shannon developed Information Theory as a recognition of a coming digital world and the need to understand how well these digits could perform in what was a noisy environment. The result was Shannon's Channel and Source Coding Theorems, namely how fast you could use a given channel and how small a number of bits you could reduce a piece of information. Wiener on the other hand saw a predominantly analog world and his paradigm was the construct of feedback in an uncertain environment.

Wiener's problems were epitomized in my view by two embodiments. The first was the development of gun tracking radars to predict where a plane would be and aim accordingly and the second the Boston Arm, the first embodiment of analog feedback in a human environment enabling an amputee to regain some semblance of use of facilities.

Into that world came McCulloch. He was examining neurons, the brain, and how that could be modelled using the general ideas of Cybernetics. In his approach, he and his students sought to take what was then known of the brain, mostly from inferential experiments on animals, many being dogs, and from the expanding body of histological insights starting in many ways with Cajal. McCulloch was charismatic and affable and had a way of bonding with his students. Wiener was sometimes problematic, a true genius, at times insecure, but always pushing the envelope of thought.

The book by Abraham is an attempt to explain McCulloch. This book has strong points and unfortunately in my opinion many weak ones. Overall it covers McCulloch's life in an organized and readable manner. It focuses on his works in a general sense and it explains the world around McCulloch.

Unfortunately, the book reads like a slightly edited Doctoral Thesis. One does not get to understand the world in which McCulloch worked in nor is there any reasonable discussion of his specific contributions. The twenty years at MIT are presented but one walks away wondering what he may have accomplished there. It would appear that when he arrived he ceased his experimental work and focused solely on mentoring students.

One of the areas I would certainly like to have seen discussed was the apparent strain between he and Wiener. What had happened and why. Admittedly Wiener may have been difficult from time to time, as had been Noted by Wiesner, yet he had the ideas and he had a platform.

The author should have spent time discussing in a readable manner what the work entailed, what Letvin added, what was the contribution of Minsky, of Papert, Perceptrons and the evolution of Artificial Intelligence. One key question would have been: what is the structure of human thought versus the construct of a thinking machine? Was AI in this time an attempt to reconstruct the human brain, by first understanding it, or the attempt to construct machines that do things like a human, like pattern recognition.

Regrettably, I was left asking more questions than having insight. I am old enough to have seen this great ocean liners passing in the night but young enough to not fully understand their time and circumstances. Overall the book is a reasonable attempt but it should in my opinion have dealt more deeply with the other players as well as the fundamental questions.",4

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cybernetic Trading Strategies: Developing a Profitable Trading System with State-of-the-Art Technologies,Introduction to Applied Intermarket Analysis & Trading,"This book focuses on intramarket trading rountines, by which I mean using one market to estimate the behavior of another before it happens. This idea was first introduced by John Murphy. However, he did not, at that time, present trading paradigms.
In my opinion, Ruggerio does not intend this book to be a complete exposition on intermarket trading systems, much less on ""cybernetic trading strategies."" He does present enough examples to show the way to develop your own, presumably more sophisticated intermarket systems. Ruggerio really doesn't attempt to program and use technical analysis, nor does he claim to. His discussion of neural nets and genetic algorithms are very introductory. These are, however, topics that require at least a book each, absent a very good background by the reader.
In short, this is a pretty decent idea book, or rather approach book dealing with computer driven trading systems which use intermarket analysis. Personally, I think it's a useful book, even though I don't use the approach: I'm more technically oriented.
If you are looking for a definitive approach to using modern math to make a zillion dollars while you watch basketball, this isn't the book. Of course, you won't find that book, but that is a different discussion. Don't go here for neural nets or genetic algorithms, either. See Goldman(?) for the latter. I'm no help for the former.
I should note that this book is aimed at commodity traders. Stock traders can make use of the techniques by translating ""commodity name"" to ""sector name,"" assuming one uses sector analysis.",19

Lee Gillette,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,"You've done it again, Mr. Maltz.","One of the first copies of Maxwell Maltz's book, Psycho-Cybernetics is still, to this day, on my bookshelf.

In 1961, It did much more than just put me on my quest for self-improvement. For the very first time, someone connected the mind to the body and brought home the old, simple adage ... ""Change your Mind and you change your life!""

That was Psycho-Cybernetics. That was the principle of Self Image Psychology ... proven and verified by science itself as an irresistible and powerful no nonsense psychology of happiness and fulfillment.

From there on ... for decades ... everything else that was printed in the Self Help Industry became supporting commentary for the principles in this book.

An now ... the new ""enhanced"" version of Psycho-Cybernetics just arrived. And Yesssss!!! I enjoyed this one as much as the original. If not more so!

Comparing the two, the new authors kept the voice and the insights of the original text intact, integrating only the updates needed for new generations to come to experience and cherish the joy of reading this old, new classic for the first time. And experience it, you will. You cannot do otherwise.

Indeed, it gives me great pleasure to recommend this new version of the book that's been around for over a half century. If you are not among the 35 million+ people who read the older one ... please, do yourself a favor ... get a copy now and read it!

You will find that Psycho-Cybernetics will do it to you, as it did it to us, decades ago. True to its kind, the new Enhanced version of Psycho-Cybernetics is still the only book that scientifically proves the principle of Self Image Psychology and makes it the new foundation for a new century's hope, success and the dream of a better life.

And the beat goes on!",43
Richard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,I've come across and read a lot from people like Jack Canfield,"I've been on a self-help reading kick for about the past year. Between issues in my finances, health, relationships, career, I was being weighed down by it all. I've come across and read a lot from people like Jack Canfield, Joel Osteen, Law of Attraction - Teachings of Abraham, etc. They were all good, uplifting and helpful works in their own right, but something was missing. I was listening to a podcast and the host mentioned this book, which was something I've never heard about - ever or anywhere. I looked it up on Amazon and decided to order it. I am sure glad I did. For me, it brought all of the other ideas, concepts and practices together. Things like affirmations, burning desires, faith, action - they all are great, as long as they're operating in conjunction with the way you see yourself and want to see yourself. This book really stresses the importance of focusing on your self-image, which is something I've found many of the other works glossed over or lacked. It's a good work, laced with some biblical references which aren't overwhelming. If you can spend the money on it, it is certainly a great addition to your library. I've recommended it to everyone.",36
Andrei,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,That which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger... it's just a matter of how you choose to see things.,"One of the best self help books I've ever read... written in the 60's by a plastic surgeon to help those still disfigured after reconstructive surgery get on with life, it will give you skills to accept and be at peace with almost anything life will ever dump on you. Once you read this you will realize how many recent best sellers just regurgitate knowledge and wisdom that was already available 50 years to centuries ago, now for the sake of making a buck.

This was recommended to me back in 1976 when I was 19, has made all the difference in the world, has also made a profound difference to everyone I have ever suggested this to and helped through crisis (and still do now, 2016.) When everyone is running around with their heads cut off you'll be the calm one wondering what the fuss is all about... able to maintain perspective and focused on what's important and needs to be done personally and professionally when either or both worlds seem to be falling in on you... I've more than survived brain damage (more than once) , divorce, career ending disability, cancer, premature death of those closest to me.. things I never expected... and can say that which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger if you happen to have the right set of coping skills in your bag of tricks. When people marvel how I just keep on going and wonder how I do it.... and I say... read this book... Every moment you are alive is a gift, that's why its called the present. be happy, be well... make the most of what you do have.",11
Brian Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Funny name. Great book!," “Creative striving for a goal that is important to you as a result of your own deep felt needs, aspirations and talents (and not the symbols which the ‘Joneses’ expect you to display) brings happiness as well as success because you will be functioning as you were meant to function. Man is by nature a goal-striving being. And because man is ‘built that way’ he is not happy unless he is functioning the way he was made to function—as a goal-striver. Thus true success and true happiness not only go together but each enhances the other.”

“Every human being has been literally ‘engineered for success’ by his Creator. Every human being has access to a power greater than himself.”

~ Maxwell Maltz from Psycho-Cybernetics

Psycho-Cybernetics. Funny name.

Great book! Maxwell Maltz was a world-renowned plastic surgeon who discovered that, while some people’s lives changed dramatically after he altered their appearance through plastic surgery, some people’s lives *didn’t*. He deduced that the primary factor that differentiated these groups was their self-image—not what they saw in the mirror but the images they had of themselves in their MINDS. Cool stuff.

He spent the second half of his career merging this self-image psychology with the then-popular science of “cybernetics”—which studies how things like guided missiles or “servo-mechanisms” hit their targets through a clear goal and constant adjustment of their course.

Here are some of the Big Ideas:

1. Cybernetics - Servo-mechanisms & you.
2. The Success Instinct - We’ve all got it!
3. Imagination - The first key.
4. Dehypnotize Yourself! - Starting now. :)
5. Rational Thought - How to use it.

Here’s to getting our Psycho-Cybernetic on as we set inspired goals, imagine our ideals, take action as we correct inevitable mistakes and practice FEELING our success. :)

Elias,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,"Self Image, the true success book","I have had many obstacles throughout life. The reasons for my obstacles finally dawned upon me through the wise words of Bob Proctor, as he mentioned the self image. He recommended a book on it, by Maxwell Maltz. Anyone who wants to make a change, a true change, this book is for you. If it's losing that weight for real, or getting that confidence, or daring to do amazing & out of the comfort zone things, then as mentioned THIS IS FOR YOU! Changing your self image and having an honest look on your self, will not only improve the quality of your life but those around you as well.

Nafiz Elgun,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,The best self book on mindset EVER!,"This book was recommended by a millionaire mentor of mine. This book has already started to help me immensely turn my brain and thoughts into an asset instead of it being a battlefield of negative thoughts and having the self image of myself as being unworthy and not believing in myself.

I remember reading reviews for this book only 2 months ago and trying to convince myself not to take the plunge despite all of the people saying this book changed their life.

Well...it was one of the best decisions I have made. And i confidently know I will use the practices in this book for the rest of my life to be a happy, confident, and strong goal-attacking person. Dr. Maltz's guidance is already starting to ring in my head almost daily.

I value the mental benefits of this book in the thousands honestly.

Just get it. Start. Do the practice exercises. Don't be judgmental of it and it will work for you.",2
WWF,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Salesmen and sports,"This Dan Kennedy revision of Maxwell Maltz's original Pscyho-cybernetics is in my opinion so geared towards salesmen and sports that if you're not a salesman, athlete, sports fan or an avid golfer, the text can be hard to get through. Sadly, Maltz's original version of Psycho-cybernetics is not offered as a Kindle book, which is why I bought this one.
Maltz's original, which I read as a teenager in the 70s, also featured athletes and salespeople, but Maltz was more inclusive in his approach. This new version should be entitled something like ""Psycho-cybernetics for Salesmen and Sports."" Salesmen and sports are great and important, but potential readers should at least be given some indication that Kennedy has taken Maltz's book so heavily in that direction so that they can decide whether or not it's really for them.",13
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Top 10 of all time.,"This is one of those few books that put forth a new idea that has not only stood the test of time but has been woven into the fabric of the entire self development industry. It's up there with ""Think and Grow Rich"" and "" How to win friends and influence people"".

It starts slow and after 2 or 3 chapters I was beginning to question the purchase. ""There is nothing to DO"" I thought. Then after it got going I felt there was TOO MUCH to do. Lots of excersises.

Of course, like so many things, the crux is in the application. Will you use it?

I think the thing I liked best is that you can really hear Dr Maltzs' passion for humanity and sincere desire to help. He seems like a wonderful man.

Also that he isn't in the pie-in-the-sky ""anyone can do anything"" camp. He teaches us to be truthful about our actual limitations, which do have limits, but are far above what most people do or even aspire to.

I put this on a short Must Read list of a handful of classics and consider it a must for anyone pursuing their full potential.

a_man,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Unlock your personality,"I stumbled upon this book by accident, having read a profound article that mentioned this book as one of its sources. I bough this book for less than 10 dollars and I must say, this is one of the best investments I have ever made. Easy to read, this book's ideas MAKE SENSE and are profound. I'd like to save my biggest reviews for one chapter only: Unlock your personality. I read this chapter at time when I was depressed, because I didn't get along with people too well. I was reserved, shy and was a social dud. My entire college years, I've been a social dud. My social life sucked. It sucked because I didn't know how to get along with people - I was irritable with people and might have appeared mean to many. The chapter: Unlock your personality might have changed my life. To follow the chapter and its advices precisely requires faith in yourself. A great leap indeed. Don't think, says the late Dr. Maltz -and act. Thinking only complicates things further. Don't think, don't over analyze yourself and just BE. It might as well be a magic bullet. It was for me, I think. Read that chapter over, and over, and over and it will eventually click. Be yourself is the message - and don't think. In social situations, don't think - and just be. Just be. Read the chapter, and you will understand what I mean. ;)",14

I didn't open it for a few years due to the scary title. Finally when I did begin reading it, I couldn't put it down. This world renowned plastic surgeon, through his practice and research, discovered how the mind particularly the subconscious mind plays a significant role in guiding individuals to their greater destiny! As I told the hundreds of individuals to whom I referred this book.....THIS IS A BOOK TO EXPERIENCE, NOT JUST READ!

Guillermo Velez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Worth the try for the cost,"Facts: It rook me months to do a decent job to relax and use the techniques described in the book. More than one reading and reading into details were necessary for me to grasp the right way to visualize what I wanted. The essentials of the book probably could me summarized in one chapter but the book includes a lot of examples, typical of this type of books. I did not achieve much the first couple of months on my first goal of reach my ideal weight. Then, my wife got me into a weight loss program and now I am well on my way to reach my goal. I keep doing the relaxation and visualization of reaching my ideal weight.

Opinion: I seek for a way to ""program"" the subconscious for a long time and this is the closest thing I have found. I started with a goal and the right tool just came along and I do not believe in coincidences. The weight loss program is making me loss weight. The techniques described in the book makes me follow the program with a very high level of discipline. The desire to reach my target weight is so high that I am able to sort almost all challenges I face to deviate from the weight loss program. I think that for the cost of the book is worth the try if you believe that you are a person of habit, that you behavior is ruled by your subconscious and you need to program that subconscious mind to change your behavior and achieve your goal",1

enya1978,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,A Book Ahead of its Time (and Ours),"This is the only book you need to read to be happy. I want to thank Mr. Maltz for this book, and express my regret that I did not find it when I was like, 12.

I knew it was a good book the minute I read ""You are not inferior. You are not superior. You are YOU"". I knew it was a good book when I read about how Maltz dismisses obtaining positive self image through ""willpower"". How many of you have heard well-meaning friends and coworkers say ""think positive"" about something that troubles you? How many of you have wondered why this well-meaning advice seldom helps? Maltz hits the nail on the head when he tells, and illustrates, why willpower and forcing positive thoughts into your head does not work. AND....he specifically tells you how to change your thought process so the positive thoughts come naturally. He gives you simple (but important) exercises to help you obtain and use the concepts he teaches.

I am a firm believe that once you have a positive image, life seems to turn out better. Not only does it look better through clear (instead of mud-shaded) glasses....but your new found self image will help you get the things you want. It will give you the power to go after what you want because you finally feel worthy. Instead of brainwashings and piecemeal advice, Maltz lays a solid groundwork using pure logic as to why YOU are worthy, and how you can convince yourself of this fact. He even gives concrete visuals to aid his lessons (healing emotional scars, much like facial scars). Emotional facelift.

This man is a genius. Do yourself a huge favor, buy this book and read it. Then read it again.",5

The sooner in life you can get these perspectives, the better for you and your loved ones. The theme in each chapter tends to develop somewhat slowly. Maltz tends to gather various points, from many different authors and sources, and takes some pages so that they coalesce into very significant and meaningful approaches to life that have immense practical value. And this is a workbook, meant to be used as a guide for your own personal work, which we all need to do very much of. Just reading it quickly through and moving on to the next book would be a huge waste.

I personally found much of the material to be ... not dense ... but dry. I hate to say that because Maltz is clearly such an intelligent man with an important message and helpful advice. But, it is true, in my opinion.

After several moves, it was lost. I recently repurchased it due to it's past impact on my thinking. A primary point that the late Dr. Maltz emphasized was his observation that plastic surgery had unexpected results with different people. For some, a minor correction caused a major personality change for the better. For others, even where the cosmetic change was more pronounced, the person's personality changed little, if at all. He attributed this to the person's innner / self image. Another key point was the power of visualization, that, if vivid / realistic enough, can have the same effect on the brain as if actually seeing / doing, a point now used regularly in sports training, et al. Both these points and others helped me immensely through my teen years and into early adulthood to break out of my ""shell"", and minimize the tendency to prejudge outcomes or approach change / the unknown negatively.

I found the author Dr. Maltz to be incredibly insightful and the no nonsense way he delivered the information was rather refreshing. I've read my fair share of ""self help"" books and I can honestly
say that most of them carry on a lot about psychological mumbo jumbo, but NOT this one! Dr Maltz is a serious straight shooter and he really just says it like it is. I found many of the ideas he presented to cause ""ah ha"" moments inside me and the information is also very relevant, even in todays world which at first I thought might be an issue since this book was written many years ago. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a way to better understand their self-image and in essence make it better.
By far my favorite part of the book is the idea he delivers that we don't need to dredge up our past and relive it and ""figure it out"" in order to get over it. He just basically says, forget it, and move on! I LOVED THAT!! It makes me feel free from past baggage that I thought may have been holding me back. Really a great book!

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Best book for self development I've found,"I have been studying psychology for the past 3 years at least, and have delved into topics such as NLP, hypnosis, destructive patterns etc. I have studied each of these topics and more in great depth and detail, and have to say that this book is by far the most treasured possession I own. This book is what I consider to be the answer, the key to all of self development. If you want to accomplish ANYTHING and you are not, there is a reason for it, and this book can help you. If you will read it, and then re-read it, and then re-read it, until you begin to fully understand and comprehend the principles and concepts presented, it will change your life....dramatically.

The book's whole premise is that we all behave not according to how things actually are, but how we perceive them to be. As a result of this, our beliefs can be very skewed, and thus our behavior will be as well. It is the task of this book to teach and instruct the reader in how to recognize irrational beliefs, use rational conscious thought to determine what they want to believe instead, and then use principles such as ""theater in the mind"" and ""acting as if"" to create a new reality experienced by your mind, which will program your self image, and thus create a new objective reality around you.

My personal opinion is that this book contains the key, the solution to any problem you are currently having, which you want to change but don't know how to, or are unsure of where to start. I highly recommend it.",8
Gadgeteer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,"Written decades ago, but still pertinent","Dr. Maltz, originally a face surgeon, came to recognize in his patients a need for a positive self image, which need transcended the physical characteristics that patients wanted improved.

He compares the methodology of achieving a desired improvement in one's self image with that used in the design of modern physical automatic control systems (he uses the term ""Cybernetics"" to describe the servomechanism systems of his day, such as those used in military fire control systems).

The concept is imaginative, and Dr. Maltz uses most of his book to describe various methods for helping change one's self image to the one that is desired, presumably by using negative feedback control to minimize the difference between one's current self image and one's desired self image, similar in concept to how military fire control systems operate.

While the basic ideas presented by Dr. Maltz are intriguing the human brain is so much more complex than the design of a military fire control system that the basic concepts presented must be taken with this important limitation in mind.

The fact that book is still in print after many decades and has sold many millions of copies, however, is a tribute to some validity of Dr. Maltz's basic concepts.",3

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Great book,"I purchased the updated version of this book first (edited by Dan Kennedy), and then bought this one. I would definitely recommend this one, because although Dan Kennedy means well, the updated version just has too much stuff in it, and it's easy to lose sight of the forest for all the trees, so to speak. This book has all the nuts and bolts of psycho cybernetics in it, and you won't need another one if you really study and read it.
If you're really trying to change your life, or a certain habit, or any other kind of personal change, this is the book for you. It's the science of how the mind works - and it's more fundamental than anything by Tony Robbins, The Secret, Hypnosis, and NLP. This book is extravagant and foundational for personal change and I'd recommend it with the highest level I possibly could for everyone. I've bought 5 extra copies, and gave them away to friends and family; that's how impressed I am with it.",9

Reggie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Nothing psycho about ths book,"Not for the novice reader. Psycho-Cybernetics: A new technique for using your subconscious power should not be read in one sitting. You should take time to absorb and personally relate to every page. Do not expect to accept or even understand the subconsciously presented concepts of the human mind. Your first impression of the book will not be your last and most likely it will not even be correct. Share this book with a friend or better yet buy a second book. Compare your concept of the book with someone who has read the book. The book I bought was my gift to a Catholic Priest. He has not spoken to me since I gave him the book.

Sharon Delarose,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Maltz exposes the true power of the mind,"Everything is possible if you believe... the power of the mind is incredible. Amaze yourself. We are capable of so much more than we are taught to believe. If only they taught this in school. This is what we should be teaching our kids. Psychocybernetics doesn't teach you what to think, but HOW to think in such a way that your entire life will be transformed. Improve yourself in any area, sports, your job, your love life, simply by readjusting your approach to the world. Maxwell Maltz exposes the secrets of how powerful our thoughts are. And he offers scientific proof to back it up. Maxwell Maltz tells it better than most anybody else I've read.

I first encountered this book back in the early 80's. I didn't know it then but my life was being transformed into something pretty amazing and this was one of the books that helped me change the entire course of my life. Many books passed thru my hands but this was a keeper. I sent my sister a copy nearly 20 years later in the hopes that she could restart her life in a happier new direction.",2

Phil Saparov,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Life-changing read,"I used the advice presented in this book to bring about major change with great results at least twice.
First, when I sprained my knee and tore my ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament), I used the concept of striving towards a goal and thinking of my physical body as a servo-mechanism to heal myself. Where I got the method of healing is a whole 'nother story. But the concept of driving yourself towards an image of Health instead of trying to get away from disease really helped.

It no longer mattered what exactly was wrong with my knee - whether it was a partial or complete tear, or whether one or two menisci had been torn, and to which degree. The idea was to focus on the solution instead of the problem. It took me about 3 months to get back to living a normal life, where I could dance, run, and even do heavy squats again.

The second time I used this concept was when I had completely exhausted my system as a result of emotionally and physically draining work that I had been doing for a long time and for too many hours per week. At some point, all of a sudden, I got a whole host of physical and emotional problems, the worst of which was a pretty severe case of depression.

I changed my job, and went in for different therapies, some of which helped to a degree. But I attribute most of the success, especially in the emotional part, to Psychocybernetics. You see, different therapists analyzed my condition and tried to heal each of the causes that might have had an ill effect on me. This made me focus too much on the causes, which were the problem, instead of focusing on the solution.

Once again, I armed myself with Psychocybernetics and went to work. It took me about 3-4 months to feel almost 100% again. But the most important thing that I remember was that as soon I started to focus on the image of health and think about all the things I would do as soon as I was better, that's when my healing really took off.

Buy it. Use it.
Best,

Phil Saparov",13

I've only been using this method a couple of months, but it is nicer. Some hypnotists recommended to me that I get an older edition of this book, one that has not been messed with by any other additional authors, so I got this one.

Martin Zakostelsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Classic masterpiece still shining,"After reading quite a few self-help and self-examination books, this is the book I was waiting for. Although at first I was quite skeptical because of the age of the book (I though ""Would there be something new for me, would the ideas be still valid?""), after first several pages doubts dissolved and I was entirely caught.

I believe all the reviews have said already enough, so I'll keep my review short. This book has all that I want from it:
- Down-to-earth style without exaggerations. Yet very strong and moving content, explaining how human brain works, what brings us happiness/more life, and how to achieve it.
- Positive :o). Gives reader so much energy into his life.
- No easy-read. Should be read definitely more times than once.

Simply put, this is a must read in the area of self-help/psychology books.

Some of favorite quotes:

""The self-image is changed, for better or worse, not by intellect alone, nor by intellectual knowledge alone, but by ""experiencing."" Wittingly or unwittingly you developed your self-image by your creative experiencing in the past. You can change it by the same method. "" (page x)
""One of the most pleasant thoughts to any human being is the thought that he is needed, that he is important enough to help and add to the happiness of some other human being."" (page 97)

""Since man is a goal striving being, he is functioning naturally and normally when he is oriented toward some positive goal and striving toward some desirable goal. Happiness is a symptom of normal, natural functioning and when man is functioning as a goal-striver, he tends to feel fairly happy, regardless of circumstances."" (page 101)

""Our habits are not accidental, or happenstance. We have them because they fit us. They are consistent with our self-image and our entire personality pattern. When we consciously and deliberately develop new and better habits, our self-image tends to outgrow the old habits and grow into the new pattern. "" (page 108)

""To give the other person credit for being sincere, if mistaken, rather than willful and malicious, can do much to smooth out human relations and bring about better understanding between people. Ask yourself, ""How does this appear--to him?"" ""How does he interpret this situation?"" ""How does he feel about it?"" Try to understand why he might ""act the way he does."""" (page 115)

""Man maintains his balance, poise, and sense of security only as he is moving forward--or seeking. When you think of yourself as having attained the goal, you become static, and you lose the security and equilibrium you had when you were moving towards something. The man who is convinced that he is ""good"" in the absolute sense, not only has no incentive to do better, but he feels insecure because he must defend the sham and pretense."" (page 137)

""Regardless of your feelings, force yourself to mix and mingle with other people. After the first cold plunge, you will find yourself warming up and enjoying it if you persist. Develop some social skill that will add to the happiness of other people: dancing, bridge, playing the piano, tennis, conversation. It is an old psychological axiom that constant exposure to the object of fear immunizes against the fear. As the lonely person continues to force himself into social relations with other human beings--not in a passive way, but as an active contributor--he will gradually find that most people are friendly, and that he is accepted. His shyness and timidity begin to disappear. He feels more comfortable in the presence of other people and with himself. The experience of their acceptance of him enables him to accept himself.""

""If responding and reacting to negative feedback does not take us further down the road to our own goal--or serve our ends, then there is no need to respond at all. And, if response of any kind gets us off course, or works against us--then no response is the appropriate response."" (page 199)

""If life adapts itself in so many varied forms to act as a means toward an end, is it not reasonable to assume that if we place ourselves in the sort of goal-situation where more life is needed, that we will receive more life?"" (page 261)",7

Just put your doubts aside and BUY THIS BOOK today.
Right now while you are thinking about it. The sooner you get it, the sooner you will benefit from its simple effective techniques.
Whatever you do, don't put it off for tomorrow. You know you will just forget about it and then it will be a MAJOR OPPORTUNITY LOST.
Just make the simple effort right now to order a copy and you will be buying a lotto ticket that is virtually certain to PAY OFF BIG for you.
It costs [very little money] and if applied even a little bit, it is likely to change your life. How many other things that cost [this little] can you say that about.
The original edition DID change MY life about 10 years ago and I know at least 5 other people who point to this book (and another classic-Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill) as major keys to their personal philosophy and success in life.
This revised edition is even better than the original due to the care put into it by Dan Kennedy, who is keeping Dr. Maltz's work alive for the present generation with this timely update.
I liked it so much I have bought 5 more copies for some great business associates as gifts.

Put the techniques that have made many ordinary people appear to be extraordinary to work for you. You don't have to work harder, you just need to apply these amazing principals to your current methods and your will be so much more effective.
I also highly recommended ""Zero Resistance Selling"" for sales persons as a companion to this book which specializes the same techniques to Sales careers.",9

J. K. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,This book is different`,"It's so easy to see how this book has sold over 30,000,000 copies. I can honestly say that I think this book has ended my search for the ""perfect"" self-help book.
After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to buy this book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I've had the book for one week now and I am already seeing results.
About 3 years ago I entered into the world of sales and all of a sudden I became painfully aware of my self-image or my self-esteem as others call it. I became very self-conscious and started down a slippery slope into the world of negative thinking and emotions that weren't helping me at all.
So I did what any person would do who wants to overcome their limiting beliefs and learn how to overcome negative thinking and I started buying self-help litereature. my library is chocked full of books from all the greats. Well I learned something from all the books that I read, but I just felt there was always something missing. I didn't feel like I had the information that I needed to really turn it all around. I tried ""Affirmations"" etc. with marginal results.
Then I found this book. Maxwell talks about how we act, feel and perform is in direct relation to how we imagine ourselves to be. You may need to read that last sentence again because it's what helped me to start putting it all together. He then gives techniques for changing your self-image and overcoming your negative thinking that really works.
I'm very grateful to Maxwell for writing this book. He really put his heart into it and made a masterpiece!
Please don't make the mistake of not buying this book. It could well be the best money you ever spent! God Bless!",21

I bought the new psycho-cybernetics and am greatly disappointed with it. It tries to be too much, almost like they've tried to add several unrelated ""books"" of unrelated info to psycho-cybernetics. There are stories and additional paragraphs of information that you're not quite sure what to do with and it clouds the original ideas. Anyone can make a book longer with lots of extra info but a nicely summarized and boiled down series of thoughts is difficult to do so get the original because that's what it is; I just ordered the original again and will leave this ""updated"" copy in the hotel I'm staying in right now.",22

LindaT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,A Good Thing Made Even Better,"I heard about the first PSYCHO CYBERNETICS book in the 60's (yes, I am over 21 years old) and when I read it I thought it was wonderful. In fact, I thought that if I only would be able to have one self-help book, it would be this one.
THE NEW PSYCHO CYBERNETICS has taken a good book and made it even better. The masterful editing and adapting by Dan Kennedy is great. It still is done in the voice of the original author, Dr. Maxwell Maltz, but it has up to date examples of people most of us know from this time in history, yet it still includes the examples Dr. Maltz wrote about in his original book.
The theme hasn't changed -- Dr. Maltz claimed that the human mind has a ""servo-mechanism"" which can help us accomplish what we desire, but we must let it do its work once the desire is ""fed into"" the mind. He drew upon his knowledge of the then fledgling work of computers. And now in the 21st century, computers have advanced in an unbelievable manner, and yet the principle behind which they work is still the same; the goal-striving mechanism which works towards its teleological end by negative feedback, correction, and positive feedback.
I have other self help books, but for me, this one is the basis on which all the others are carried out.
I can't recommend it highly enough.",23

N/A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,"Solid, Disciplined ""Self-Improvement"" Book","Unlike many other New Age type books which talks about self-elevating, self-magnificating, self-actualising, self-meditative and all that crap, this book gives some good solid ground rules on creating a strong positive mindset that will help one better oneself with practice.
This book is a modern treatment of Maltz's original book and has made it even more palatable and applicable in daily life. The exercises are simple, straightforward and effective. One just needs to practice.
You're not reading this book to be enlightened to salvation or something (which you can read the Holy Bible for!) but rather, this book prepares your mind to set goals in the daily routine of life. It is about setting goals, and consciously thinking how you could achieve them, letting your subconscious autopilot ""servo-mechanism"" help you on the way there through deliberate practical exercises. This book is even more readable than the original.
Very readable, very practical, and no ""mind power"" mystical nonsense. Just straight cut practical tips to sharpen the mind.",12
Ramon Acosta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,The first and foremost,"Without a doubt, Dr. Maltz' classic is still on top of the heap of self-help books, tapes and seminars available. Everything that was relevant in late 1950 and early 1960 is still relevant today. Unless humans fundamentally change the way the brain operates, this book will be a classic text on the process of communicating with and reprogramming the inner self.

There's only one downside about this book. If you don't try the mental techniques, nothing will change. You might manufacture a new line of thinking after absorbing the material, but if you don't practice and apply it on a near daily basis, then you've merely read one of the greatest psychology texts of all time. A bit of mental elbow grease will instead allow you to experience this book and the profound change you and your loved ones can all potentially benefit from.",7

Rubin Wald,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Great Update of a Classic!,"Dan Kennedy has done a brilliant job of giving Dr. Maltz's classic text a contemporary feel while remaining true to the original version.
I still have my 1974 Pocket Book edition of Psycho-Cybernetics and its ideas and insights helped me a lot in understanding life and success and how I could control my own destiny.
This updated version is even better! I especially liked the PRESCRIPTION and MENTAL TRAINING EXERCISE boxes that Mr. Kennedy has strategically placed throughout the book. They contain very clear suggestions and practical exercises for living an abundant and fulfilling life. For example, he prescribes keeping a ""success diary"" as a tool for building a stronger self-image. And on page 201, there is an powerful exercise for developing the all important habit of forgiveness.
One of the insights Dr. Maltz gave me that helped clarify my own life journey was his understanding that our unconscious minds cannot distinguish between a real experience and the same experience vividly imagined. Years later I found confirmation for this idea in Quantum Physics.
Nobel Prize winning Physicist Niels Bohr's Complementarity Principle shows us that the mental aspect of an imagined experience is complementary to its physical aspect. Both are equally 'real'. No wonder imagination and visualization are such valuable skills to master for anyone who wants to transform their dreams into physcial reality.
I wonder if Dr. Maltz and Dr. Bohr ever had a conversation!
Dan Kennedy has done a tremendous favor for anyone who wants knowledge and practical applications for being more successful. I applaud his efforts.",38

Ken Nuehs,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Unlocked My Success Mechanism,"As of last night, I finished the most amazing book called Psycho Cybernetics, by Maxwell Maltz. I am proud to say this is the first book that I have completed all the way through in over a year. I bought this book back in 2009 when I was fighting the boredom in Iraq and remember only reading a few chapters. After I learned that it was a recommended reading by some of the leaders in Empower Network, I decided to dust it off and see how the top earners have used this book to unlock their success mechanisms and start living a more fulfilling life.

And boy, I'm glad I did!

This powerful book has provided so much value to my life. I now know the power of imagination and have started to imagine successful outcomes when going through a sales presentation, public speaking presentations, and any areas of my life that I'm not completely comfortable and confident in.

And let me tell you the concepts in Psycho Cybernetics works!

I've had my best month in personal training sales at the gym with over $3,000 in sales in just the first 3 weeks. One sale worth $1,950. My previous best was $1,800 for the full month.

Today's psychology calls Dr. Maltz proven psychological theories ""Positive Psychology"", and it is the most used therapy method used today!

Ken McCarthy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,A masterpiece made even better,"The original Psycho-Cybernetics had a massive impact on my life.

This new edition is, amazingly enough, even better than the original. It's clearer, easier to follow, and even more compelling. I'll always be grateful to the person who recommended this to me when I was 20 years old. Twenty two years later, I'm living a life most people only dream of. I owe it all to my outlook and this book was where I began to make the connection between outlook and happiness and results in life. Essential reading.",390

A User,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Better Than the Original; Max Would Have Been Proud,"Greetings:
Join us at the Psycho-Cybernetics discussion group on [...]
To date, I have bought three hardcover editions of the New Psycho-Cybernetics (NPC): one I gave to a friend, one I take with me to read during the day, and one I keep in my home office to work with on those days when I work at home. I have found it a significant improvement upon the original. (I have used up three paperback versions of the original over the last 10 years.)
I remember when I first read the original version of PC, in around 1990. I thought it was somewhat hokey. I used to be an engineer, and I thought it somewhat strange to try to apply feedback control systems theory to people. We are not machines, after all.
The strange thing, though, was that the system worked for me. Still, I was somewhat embarrassed about the whole thing, so I sort of kept my dabbling to myself.
Then, in the mid-late nineties, I read Fritjof Capra's book, The Web of Life. In that book, Capra talks a lot about systems theory, and he also goes into the history of the original cybernetics group (not Psycho cybernetics, but rather a group of mathematicians, psychologists, biologists, and physicists who collaborated in WWII to create anti-aircraft guns that could effectively track and destroy enemy aircraft). In his discussion, Capra explains that the original cybernetics group's goal was to try to make machines that could do what people and animals do naturally and easily, without conscious thought. They tried to do this, in part, by observing the actions of animals and people. Based on such observation, the group devised the early foundation of what became our modern science of systems control as used in almost every modern electrical/mechanical system.
What Maltz tried to do was take a bit of the science and art of systems control and apply it back to people, in an attempt to improve their functioning. I think one of the original cyberneticists, Norbert Weiner, also tried to do this in his book, The Human Use of Human Beings, but I could be wrong.
Anyway, because Psycho-Cybernetics is based on systems theory, in contrast to other types of ""self help"" or positive thinking books, it recognizes that a person trying to achieve her goals is going to fail, and miss what she is pursuing, probably many times on her way to her destination. Rather than candy coating this fact and suggesting ""positive thinking,"" PC suggests feedback control system oriented techniques to use, deal with, and not be completely stymied by such failures.
It also provides techniques to help one deal with ""drama queen"" co-workers and supervisors who seem to go out of their way to provide damaging negative feedback (e.g., ignoring negative feedback in ch. 11, ""How to Unlock Your Real Personality""), or retarding how fast responds to negative feed back (e.g., delaying the response, as in ch. 12 ""Do It Yourself Tranquilizers that Bring Peace of Mind."").

Now, on to the new version of PC: my own opinion is that it is better than the original. Dan follows the original structure of the PC book, and much of the text is in common. However, Dan has buttressed that text with additional examples taken from the many hours of recordings and reams of Maltz' notes that Dan owns. In addition, Dan also provides many practical examples of the successful application of PC techniques that have arisen since the original version of the book was published in 1960.
Try NPC. If, like me, you have areas in your life where you would like to do better, I think you will find it useful.",48

Susil Manchanayaka,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Understand Yourself,"I bought this book and read it. It is interesting for many reasons. I am a lover of books and I am married to books (metaphorically). Why I say that this book is interesting is that it is life changing. The few dollars I spent on this book is worth and I learnt a lot by reading this book. The chapters are shorter and easy to grasp. Some ideas may be unfamiliar to a novice reader but if you are an experienced and an avid reader, you can get at the gist of the book.

Many people have complexes (psychological) and they struggle to come out of the shell they live in. This book helps you to see the world as it is and you can transform your life with ideas from the book. The ideas in the book are worth remembering and practicing. If you are into understanding the nature of human mentality, behavior and why people do certain things but why they are afraid of doing certain things is interesting. In our lives we undergo numerous pains and we sometimes become depressed and helpless. This book helps anyone to see the world as it is.

The writer is an experienced professional in his field and particularly this book helps one to be motivated, enthusiastic in anything she does and develop confidence. He is a leading scholar and a much respected counselor. I read about his biography on the net and I was very impressed. He is an authority on his subject. I can say that this book is a booster - it boosts your performance. It is light reading.

Maltz takes the reader into an unexplored area of human mentality, how to overcome fears, the basis of fear and personal development. He helps the reader overcome fears. He argues that most of the fears we have are all baseless and unscientific. Fears come out of ignorance. Fears come out of wrong perceptions we have. Fears come out of not being exposed to the world we live in. That is what he says.

The book is pocket sized and you can carry it when you travel. It is like a handbook on personal development. If you have any interest in mentoring, counseling, public speaking or teaching, this is the next book you may consider reading.

I personally like the ideas in the book. The time you may spend will be worth the trouble you take to read this book. The chapters in it are short and run into a couple of pages and at a single sitting you can read a chapter. Make this book a partner in your life. It is worth buying and keeping in your private library. In life one may experience ups and downs. Tribulations in life are part of human existence on this planet. We seek advice from others, counselors, teachers or if you belong to a profession of respect - mentors. This book is a companion mentor. If you are in need of some expert advice, consult this book. Discuss what is in it. It will pay rich dividends.

The final verdict on the book is that it is a book of interesting ideas for us to be human. It is a book that teaches us how to face life. It is a book that teaches us live happily. It is a book that teaches us how to help others in need. My friends, read it. You will soon see a dramatic transformation in your life. It is life changing and mind changing. The contents of the book are to be digested (metaphorically). The ideas in the book by Maltz (the writer) will enlighten you all.

N/A,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,bizzare...,"My big problem with this book is the material that Dan Kennedy added. While it provides useful background and some updated examples, Kennedy weaves it in seemlessly into the old material. What you get is confusion. The first person of Kennedy is mixed in with the first person of Maltz, without being differentiated in any way! So in the same section, you have someone speaking of ""my patients"" in the '40's or '50's, and then the same voice speaking of ""my experiences"" with a Kevin Costner movie or a Michael Jordan anecdote. There is no change in typeface, or paragraph structure to indicate that different people are writing, one long-dead, the other alive and ""editing"" this book. Why didn't Kennedy's editor make him place his commentary separately?
This was enough to spoil most of the usefulness of this edition for me. I suggest noting the boxed exercises that Kennedy includes, which are useful, and then reading the original of the book.",53

Jon Torodash,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,A pioneer in the field still standing strong,"I don't make it a habit to read self-help books, but the off-color fitness guru Matt Furey has made a killing on selling a program based off of Maltz's work, and most other ""motivational speakers"" usually bend a knee in respect to Maltz as a forerunner. So I picked up a cheap used copy and read it cover to cover. The only question I have left is why anyone would bother with any of the other crap. This book effectively condenses the entirety of the self-help field. As far as I can tell, this is as good as it gets by the standards of the genre, is enjoyably accessible to a general audience, and has weathered time's attack on its relevance stunningly well.

Firstly, Maltz had the raw clinical experience necessary to write this kind of book. As a crackerjack plastic surgeon he saw immediately and firsthand the life-changing or life-stalling power of self-image at work in the faces of his patients. (And anyone who scoffs at unorthodox contributors to a research field ought to know that Albert Einstein was working for the Swiss patent office when he submitted the Theory of Special Relativity.) Yet Maltz also admits where exactly the limits of his knowledge lie rather than try to convince the reader of his omniscience.

Secondly, Maltz was receptive to many fundamental tenets of psychology and philosophy and works them into Psycho Cybernetics clearly and without contradiction. Nor does he try to repackage ancient metaphysical hokum with inane and feeble examples.

Thirdly, there are no workshops, special reports, live phone help, or products to buy. (Though I cannot speak for the organization that has cropped up around Maltz's name.) All pretense and exaggeration for marketing purposes seem absent from his book.

Maltz was definitive and unequivocal in his ideas, quick to set a standard and stick to it. He took seriously some very fundamental issues of life and makes clear statements. This book rises high above the haphazard pop philosophy/ethics smeared all over mass media which are either shallow and weak or imperiously stupid. Maltz simply faced the truth of his own convictions. Psycho Cybernetics by no means outlines life management skills as an exact science, but its frank suggestions are intellectually compelling. Overall, the book is worthwhile because Maltz' honest and non-condescending style at least earns your respect, if not your belief.",467

Jay Johnson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Horribly Boring Book,"This book will put you to sleep. Unfortunately I bought it based on all the high reviews. I guess I missed something.

Each chapter seemed to ramble on and on. It is a lengthy book and it seems like a lot of the chapter content was redundant saying the same thing over. The book discusses one's self image, happiness, success and how to evaluate it in life.

The author has a section about SUCCESS (sense of direction, understanding, courage, charity, esteem, self confidence and self acceptance). However each of these bullet points were very basic principles. Same applies to his chapter on FAILURE (frustration, aggressiveness, insecurity, lonliness, uncertainty, resentment and emptiness). Again, very basic material.

For me the last third of the book was more boring than the other two-thirds. It was a hard book to finish being so uninteresting. I can't recommend this book.",6

Christian Rosenkreutz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Outdated psuedo-science,"I consider myself to be pretty open-minded, especially in regards to the potentials of the human mind, but this book actually reads like a laundry list of little ""fixes"" to do with your life, and reads more like a precursor to infomercial formats than to gaining any kind of insight whatsoever.

The author declares right away that he is not a psychologist, but considers himself qualified (and believe me, I am not a fan of the word ""qualified"" by any means) and continues to compare himself to Einstein, Madam Curie, Wright Brothers (should I have to mention all of their minds actually created advances that changes the entire world without question?) all in the preface, before you even get to the table of contents, which I will briefly list a few entries:

""your key to a better life""

""the success mechanism within you""

""first key to success mechanism""

""dehypnotize yourself""

""let your success mechanism work for you""

""habit of happiness""

""success-type personality""

""failure mechanism""

""how to give yourself an emotional facelift""

""do-it-yourself tranquilizers that bring peace of mind""

I won't go any further, although there are more. My problem is that not only is this self-proclaimed ""scientist/psychologist"" coining new terms, he does it in a very QVC way. I am all for understanding the programming we submit ourselves to, and ways to understand the mind, and patterns of thought, however this book is a waste of time, only for the mindless reader that in fact turns off their brain to read this book (the author actually asks you to do that while reading, its in one of the first chapters, right after he tries to convince the reader that ""telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition have been established by scientific laboratory experiments."" That is the actual sentence from page 24. I would be delighted by nothing more than to get ahold of these ""scientific laboratory experiments"" data records to see this for myself.

Instead of posing questions about what needs to come and pondering on the advancements that will be achieved by science he just simply states ""God made you this way now be happy with it.""

J. West,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho Cybernetics 2000,DON'T get the WRONG book! Get ISBN 0671700758,"There are two versions of the book that look almost exactly the same on the outside but their contents are very different:
#1) ""Psycho-Cybernetics"" by Maxwell Maltz, M.D.,F.I.C.S [1960 ISBN 0671700758]
#2) ""Psycho-Cybernetics"" by Maxwell Maltz FOUNDATION & Bobbe Sommer [1993 ISBN 156731306X].

Make sure you get the original 1960 written by Maxwell himself. The 1993 ""update"" is so painful to read because the new author, Bobbe Sommer literally QUOTES Maxwell Maltz repeatedly while trying to add her own insightful messages. For example, on page 3 of her ""update"", she states:

""Whether we realize it or not,"" Maltz wrote, ""each of us carries...""

Well, if you just read the original 1960's book, your eyeballs don't waste time on the ""Maltz wrote"" phrase altogether... duh!...because Maxwell was the one who wrote it!

The only reasons to endure Bobbe Sommer's endless ""Maltz said....; Maltz learned that...; Maltz studied...; Maltz wrote...; Maltz realized..."" is if she added some totally mindblowing ideas OR contradicted his work. In my opinion she didn't.

BTW, I was not prejudiced by reading the original first and then reading the 1993 update to see if it was any better; I actually (and unfortunately) read the 1993 book first. I thought the 1960 original was out of print but I accidentally stumbled on the original copy at Border's Books. I read a chapter and realized his true words were so much more inspirational. Not dry and academic like Bobbe Sommer's version. I think the publisher of the new book was deliberately trying to confuse the public by making the cover look the same as the old one. I think it's borderline unethical...buyer beware!

Apparently, Amazon's algorithm to link up user reviews with books is heavily based on the book's title. Most of the time, this works great when there's a paperback and a hardcopy version of the same book. But in this case, the 1960's book and the 1993 are completely different and should not point to the same user reviews! All the glowing reviews listed below? They are the same for both titles. You really don't know which book the reviewers were praising. I'm going to guess it's the 1960's version. See for yourself, plug in either ISBN #s and you'll get the identical list of user reviews.

BTW, this Amazon loophole gives me a great idea: I can write a new book about how to become a master at appraising and certifying jewelry like wedding bands and title it ""Lord of the Rings""--and shazam--Amazon's engine will give my book the 5 stars and all the wonderful reviews of Tolkien's classic.

I give 5 stars for Maltz's 1960 original. I give 2 stars for Bobbe Sommer's update. Again, if the ISBN is 0671700758 click ""add to cart"". If it says ISBN 156731306X, try again.",218

Davidicus,2.0 out of 5 stars,Programming the Human Biocomputer,Not the Lilly I Remember and Revered -- Been Hairy Potter'd,"[...]. I originally read this great book in 1974, under its original title and highly recommend that edition (or 1987), or even the original paper (Always Go To the Source!). Lilly could write in very clear and concise prose, albeit 'scientific' in aspect, but this edition is really a travesty. I know how good he was, and detected something 'wrong' with this edition right away. Only later did I realize that Doctor (Beverly) Potter had butchered it and added chapters, and changed meanings (and terms), and NO, did NOT make it clear what was changed and/or edited, and poorly at that (inside cover says ""translated by"" -- translated, my butt -- this is one of the only books I've ever marked up with a pen because it was so poorly edited). You're still going to get something out of it, maybe, if you can get past the cute watermark illustrations and the ""New Age"" synthesis (lousy cover art too, DocP), which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 (and out of deference to the great John Cunningham Lilly). But why drink urine when the beer is just a click away? Not this edition, please. Poor Lilly must be spinning in alternity -- trust me, he would not have approved. Do your homework. As for Doc Potter, she specializes in ""Job Burnout"" therapy. If you ask me, too late. How did she get the rights (shame on Ronin Publishing)? That's what I want to know. Again, go to the originals if at all possible. I'm giving this copy away -- to the jailhouse (can't hurt). But the earlier (authentic, J.C. Lilly himself) editions are priceless, which is why I remembered them after 30-plus years and wanted to read them again. This one just don't cut the mustard. It cuts the cheese.",29

Enough said...",4
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Beginning of Heaven and Earth Has No Name: Seven Days with Second-Order Cybernetics (Meaning Systems (FUP)),The Cybernetics of Cybernetics,"It’s appropriate that the first sentence of this review is about its own first sentence and that the first paragraph will tell you more about the reviewer than the self-reference-themed work under review. Before I get to the review, I have a disclaimer to make: I sit on the board of the Meaning Systems book series, of which The Beginning of Heaven and Earth Has No Name is part, a circumstance which should dispose me toward a favorable review. However, I actually come to this work via a branch of the system theory family that has remained somewhat aloof to von Foerster’s group, so I was prepared to be critical. The reasons for the lack of interest in von Foerster among some in related fields seems to me now, after having gotten to know von Foerster a bit better, to be based mostly on lack of familiarity. His works sets up important questions about the meaning of meaning, which later researchers ignored, for practical reasons. But now we have come full circle, and we must address such questions before we can make any further progress in epistemology or biology.

After reading this book, I still have a bit of a quarrel with him, or rather a difference in emphasis, over the issue of constructivism. I still think he takes too radical a view. But I think many of my colleagues don’t take self-reference seriously enough, and there are lessons to be learned on all sides of this many-sided extended family. Clearly, the causality of living beings is circular, as von Foerster believes, but the wheel does get some traction in reality, usually with biological representations, less often with mental representations, which are biological representations of biological representations. If it were not the case that representations have contact with (ever-changing) reality, living beings would not appear to be purposeful, would not be adapted to their environments. But enough about my argument.

The book represents a series of discussions that von Foerster had with the editors over a period of six days. (On the seventh day they rested.) Throughout the “trialogue,” von Foerster likes to throw statements back at his interlocutors. For example, he says that when a scientist espouses a Big Bang theory, the astrophysicist tells us more about himself than the conditions of the early universe. I suspect that von Foerster overstates his case to make a point. His style of argumentation is nothing if not playful. He likes to turn our general assumptions inside-out to get us thinking in productive ways. To say the Big Bang theory says something about its promoters and something about the possible conditions of the early universe isn’t quite strange enough a statement to generate new ideas. Von Foerster was not interested in being right so much as getting people to think, and this makes for very refreshing reading, once you accept his methods.

Like this book reviewer, the editors of The Beginning of Heaven and Earth Has No Name, Karl Muller and Albert Muller, begin by writing about their own first sentence, their own first paragraph and self-referentiality. It’s a fun way to begin a scholarly book, and the Mullers reminded me of John Shade’s editor. The Mullers’ contributions add significantly to the overall success of the communication. The humor and the conversational mode make this volume informative without being dull. Von Foerster tends to represent concepts visually rather than abstractly. This is nice. He provides many anecdotal illustrations, a couple of which I made use of last week when trying to explain self-organization to a general audience. I will be quoting from this book for years to come. It’s a trove of pithy statements and pertinent examples, largely because he apparently understands how people understand. Consequently, he doesn’t teach; he helps the reader learn.

Von Foerster’s work dealt with eignenvalues, bistable functions, and recursive functions a decade or so before my mentors, complexity science workers, came along and renamed these “attractors,” “catastrophe” and “chaos theory,” respectively. He is rather good natured about the fact that these workers followed Picaso’s example. Von Foerster’s names are more accurate, less misleading. Clarity in nomenclature reveals clarity in concepts. In an English translation, eigen can mean one’s “own” or one’s particular/peculiar characteristics. It is inherent characteristics or formal qualities of a system that tend to constrain the equations that describe its behavior: nothing pulls or attracts. Listening in on his conversations with his friends and colleagues, the reader is struck by how sensible and down-to-earth this sleight-of-hand logician can be.

The novice will enjoy reading this as much as a specialist will. No prior understanding of cybernetics or constructivism is required to get the humor and the wisdom. Von Foerster’s work is still alive today and propagating itself throughout the theories of various thinkers. In sum, this is a useful book.",11

Dylan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Boundaries: The New Neuroscience of Connecting Brains with Machines---and How It Will Change Our Lives,Neuroscience: You're doing it wrong!,"Miguel Nicolelis is a Brazilian born, world-renowned neuroscientist working out of Duke University in North Carolina. He is seen as the public face of the recently begun and rapidly expanding field of Brain-Machine Interfaces, and has done much to bring widespread attention to not only that field, but to neuroscience in general. Part of why Nicolelis is seen as the representative of this field is because he brings academic research into a human context, making the ambitious claim that his research has led to a “human-to-human brain” interface, as well as giving a quadriplegic youth the ability to deliver the opening kick in the 2014 world cup held in Nicolelis’ own Brazil. This theme of bringing science, particularly neuroscience, into a more public and relevant context is one underlying his recent book, Beyond Boundaries.
The author starts his historical narrative by describing the two camps of thought in neuroscience, which he terms “localizationist” and “distributionist.” Localizationists are interested in showing how the brains spatial organization is both largely pre-determined and that there is a strong connection between spatial organization and function of brain regions. They also aim to reduce this connection to the individual neuron, imparting emergent physiological capabilities to the single cell. Distributionists, on the other hand, are more interested in how the neuronal “symphonies”, his term for the aggregate of brain activity across multiple regions, each composed of neuronal with constantly plastic and changeable functions. Dr. Nicolelis is unabashedly in the distributionist camp and this loyalty, which often borders on ranting about the ideas he opposes, is apparent throughout the book.
Dr. Nicolelis then spends much of the next several chapters going through a history of early and formative neuroscience research, invoking several of its well-known early researchers such as Cajal and Sherrington. Throughout this he shows how distributionist and localizationist thought battled for control over our understanding of the brain, and localizationist interpretations dominated for much of the time. In Nicolelis’ mind, however, the truth of the matter ultimately lies with a more holistic and systemic, rather than individual-cellular, view of the brain. The metaphor he uses is a symphony, like how a large group of instruments can indeed be described as many individual parts, the symphony cannot be simply reduced to them. The whole of the music a symphony creates is encoded as something greater than the sum of its parts; the same is true for the brain operations are greater than the sum of actions of individual neurons.
For the second half of the book, Nicolelis goes through a nonlinear history of Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs), jumping back and forth in time to serve the point of both furthering distributionist ideas but also showing the ways research across disparate geographical locations and temporal periods has been connected to make something more than just the sum of several academic papers. Continuing the distributionist metaphor and theme of the book, he shows how modern BMI research is an emergent phenomenon that is greater than just the compilation of its history, that there are gains made through original thought and in the connections between seemingly unconnected research.
Miguel Nicolelis’ book, while an extremely useful text for those academically interested in neuroscience and in Brain Machine Interfaces, shines most as a book made for those who lack exposure to science in general and neuroscience in particular. It does require some foundational knowledge of biology however, including the knowledge that the body is made up of units known as cells, and that the brain is made up of specialized cells known as neurons. While further knowledge of neurobiology would be helpful, like how neurons “signal” to each other using a combination of electrical and chemical signals, which is not absolutely necessary to get meaning from the book.
Nicolelis weaves an autobiographical narrative throughout the text, frequently connecting ideas and research to his own life experiences. Often he explains complex scientific achievements alongside powerful and understandable human metaphors to his own life, like his experience with a conductor during medical school, an experience that served as his foundation for comparing the brain to a collection of musicians. He also explains his multiple intended and pursued career paths, including once dreaming of becoming a Brazilian soccer star, prior to becoming the renowned researcher he is now. With this connection of the text and its subjects to his own life, Dr. Nicolelis both the scientific process and the researchers who utilize the scientific method. He takes what, at first blush, seems an overwhelmingly complex topic, studying the brain and eventually having the brain and computers communicate with one another, and then makes himself and the topics of the book relatable and understandable to most any reader who has the type of interests to seek out a popular press book on science. If a reader seeks out this book, they likely already possess the requisite knowledge to understand it.
Making the scientific process more human is only the start of it however-he then goes on to explain important aspects of science as an institution which aren’t often seen by the public, which the reader can now understand because of his aforementioned humanizing. Interwoven through much of his book are the conflicting ideals of localizationist and distributionist thought, a debate that has gone on for well over a century and continues to this day. This is a part of science not often understood even by those within it-that of competing and equally viable and “proven” ideas and narratives that, unfortunately, contradict one another. Science is often seen as uncovering facts and truth, but often there is a long period of competing facts and competing truths. For example, in the history of thought on the development of organisms, widespread acceptance of Darwin’s ideas is only a recent phenomenon, one preceded by intense and impassioned debates. Nicolelis gives us an insider’s view on such a debate still raging within neuroscience-if he is right, then future neuroscientists will see what is now called “distributionist” thought as factually correct, but the meaning to most people will be his insight into the process of competing ideas within science.
Miguel Nicolelis weaves three histories into his book-the history of neuroscience, and within that the history of Brain Machine Interfaces, and within even that, the history of Miguel Nicolelis. The book relates all three to one another, and then makes Nicolelis someone we can all find a bit of ourselves in, allowing a more publicly accessible understanding of him, his work, and science in general. He draws us in with this attractive idea of connecting our brains to computers, but then shows us the impassioned history and modern practice of neuroscience. It is for these reasons-the book’s popular appeal, accessibility, and educational value that I give it 5 stars. To anyone who is academically interested in Brain-Machine interfaces, mystified by the scientific process, or just wants to know the fascinating life story of this now famous Brazilian, I recommend this book to you!",5
M. Lavin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Boundaries: The New Neuroscience of Connecting Brains with Machines---and How It Will Change Our Lives,"Monkeys, tools, and boundaries","Great read for this previous friend of a Capuchin monkey years ago in LaPaz, Bolivia. I can attest that monkeys eagerly interface with tools e.g., put on lipstick with or without a mirror; without any human intervention, selectively [apparently based on empirical experience] choose and to all appearances thoroughly enjoy pharmacoactive plants of the psychodelic variety, ride pet cats like horses, and guard patios better than any watch dog. It is not surprising to me that their cousins, the Rheusus, partner with others in neuroscience labs in the study of the use of robotic tools.

My only objection is the title ""'Beyond' Boundaries."" If my understanding of what the author is saying is correct, then, once incorporated into my neural circuitry, a robot I am using to pick up tools in New York from my office in St. Louis is as much a part of me as my grabber is when I am picking up an object lying on the floor, or as much as a modern artificial limb is to an athlete who has lost his/her birth limb. It is all tool-using capacity, in which we have gone from

6. directing the robotic use of tools at a distance, not by an intermediary program, but only by means of neural networks in the brain...

I agree, it is a giant step forward, even an evolutionary step forward. But, I am not sure it is 'beyond' boundaries. To me, it is more like the very first time event of riding a bike, with..., ""Look, Mom, no hands!"" --

In this book, Nicolelis shares with us his adventure of learning how to use our brains to use tools with no hands! Breathtaking, explosive, an evolutionary leap, but not beyond boundaries: If we can envision something, we can do it. Some, like Dr. Nicolelis, have enormous vision, the capacity to bring that vision to life, and recount it beautifully.",2
Jeff Briggs,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Boundaries: The New Neuroscience of Connecting Brains with Machines---and How It Will Change Our Lives,Connecting brain orchestra to machines,"Nicolelis describes complicated scientific problems in the way understandable to broad audience. His major idea is that information is processed by distributed neural architecture (brain ""orchestra""). He developed neural implants that record from different brain regions. Nicolelis and his colleagues conducted experiments in rats and monkeys. They discovered how these animals sense and move, and they created interfaces that convert neural activities into computer codes of sense and movement, which can be then sent to robots and prostheses for the paralyzed. Nicolelis also suggests sending messages from brain to brain. In the last chapter a new treatment for Parkinson's disease is introduced. The book is well illustrated. I wish these were color illustrations. I found especially entertaining the story of Aurora monkey who controlled a robotic gripper by its own thoughts. Another monkey learned to walk on a treadmill and controlled a walking Japanese robot. I wonder if this technology can be implemented to repair the nuclear plant damaged by the earthquake. There are interesting parallels between the brain science and relativity theory. Overall, an excellent book, and thought provoking.",17
Randall,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Boundaries: The New Neuroscience of Connecting Brains with Machines---and How It Will Change Our Lives,Interesting read,"I have been a fan of this scientist/author since his ""monkey arm"" experiments. This book was amazing and I am looking forward to reading his future works.

I gave it four stars rather than five, because the music analogies were a bit distracting in my personal opinion.

In general, the book covers past, present, and projected future for the field of BMI (brain machine interfaces)and neuroprosthetics. It is written and presented in a manner that does not require overly specialized knowledge about the field, but rather could be used as an introduction for curious individuals. However, even people that have kept up with the field's growth will likely enjoy it as much as I did.",8
J. Brew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Boundaries: The New Neuroscience of Connecting Brains with Machines---and How It Will Change Our Lives,BMI for the Man in the Street,"Nicolelis uses his pioneering work on brain-machine interfaces (BMI) to educate the reader on the state of the art. In addition, he provides some valuable extrapolation of what may be possible with BMI in the future. This book is accessible to the layman who wants to learn more about the development of BMI. I highly recommend it.",1
O. Mikse,2.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Boundaries: The New Neuroscience of Connecting Brains with Machines---and How It Will Change Our Lives,Neurorobotics is finally boring... even to a scientist.,"I'm 2/3 of the way through this book and am having a hard time figuring out how I'm going to finish it. The main problem being that the author focuses on such minute and boring details to explain the findings that had such a large impact of neurorobotics. This makes for a very frustrating read. Especially, when all you're thinking about is how the book could have been a tenth of the length that it is now and conveyed the same ideas. In addition, the author is so focused on talking about himself, his findings, his acheivements, and his life, that one cannot help but think of this book as an ego stroke to himself.

Also, who is this book written for? The irony here being that it's trying to bring these complex and fundamental neurological concepts to the masses by using complex neurological jargon. In other words, the book is trying to break things down in a language that the average reader doesn't understand. The only way I understood some parts of this book is to dig deep into my brain and remember what I had learned in my Neurobiology and Animal Physiology classes in undergrad. More frustratingly, the author seems to use this heavily scientific jargon while he goes on and on about how they set up the experiments. One struggles to get through these parts only to find a very measly payoff: the experiment worked. That's good to know.

There are some parts where this book succeeds however, but as I said these are mostly the parts where the author is explaining the findings throughout history that contributed to our current understanding of the brain (these are by people other than himself). An example of this is the chapter that discusses Phantom Limb: very interesting! Also, bless the author for including pictures to go along with the scientific setups. They help tremendously when going through the boring segments.

In short, it's hard for me to recommend this book to anyone, because it's more often torturous to read than fun. Also, Dr. Nicolelis, you're Brazilian. We get it. No need to bombard us with so many pointless anecdotes about it.",6

Lee Gillette,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,"You've done it again, Mr. Maltz.","One of the first copies of Maxwell Maltz's book, Psycho-Cybernetics is still, to this day, on my bookshelf.

In 1961, It did much more than just put me on my quest for self-improvement. For the very first time, someone connected the mind to the body and brought home the old, simple adage ... ""Change your Mind and you change your life!""

That was Psycho-Cybernetics. That was the principle of Self Image Psychology ... proven and verified by science itself as an irresistible and powerful no nonsense psychology of happiness and fulfillment.

From there on ... for decades ... everything else that was printed in the Self Help Industry became supporting commentary for the principles in this book.

An now ... the new ""enhanced"" version of Psycho-Cybernetics just arrived. And Yesssss!!! I enjoyed this one as much as the original. If not more so!

Comparing the two, the new authors kept the voice and the insights of the original text intact, integrating only the updates needed for new generations to come to experience and cherish the joy of reading this old, new classic for the first time. And experience it, you will. You cannot do otherwise.

Indeed, it gives me great pleasure to recommend this new version of the book that's been around for over a half century. If you are not among the 35 million+ people who read the older one ... please, do yourself a favor ... get a copy now and read it!

You will find that Psycho-Cybernetics will do it to you, as it did it to us, decades ago. True to its kind, the new Enhanced version of Psycho-Cybernetics is still the only book that scientifically proves the principle of Self Image Psychology and makes it the new foundation for a new century's hope, success and the dream of a better life.

And the beat goes on!",43
Richard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,I've come across and read a lot from people like Jack Canfield,"I've been on a self-help reading kick for about the past year. Between issues in my finances, health, relationships, career, I was being weighed down by it all. I've come across and read a lot from people like Jack Canfield, Joel Osteen, Law of Attraction - Teachings of Abraham, etc. They were all good, uplifting and helpful works in their own right, but something was missing. I was listening to a podcast and the host mentioned this book, which was something I've never heard about - ever or anywhere. I looked it up on Amazon and decided to order it. I am sure glad I did. For me, it brought all of the other ideas, concepts and practices together. Things like affirmations, burning desires, faith, action - they all are great, as long as they're operating in conjunction with the way you see yourself and want to see yourself. This book really stresses the importance of focusing on your self-image, which is something I've found many of the other works glossed over or lacked. It's a good work, laced with some biblical references which aren't overwhelming. If you can spend the money on it, it is certainly a great addition to your library. I've recommended it to everyone.",36
Andrei,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,That which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger... it's just a matter of how you choose to see things.,"One of the best self help books I've ever read... written in the 60's by a plastic surgeon to help those still disfigured after reconstructive surgery get on with life, it will give you skills to accept and be at peace with almost anything life will ever dump on you. Once you read this you will realize how many recent best sellers just regurgitate knowledge and wisdom that was already available 50 years to centuries ago, now for the sake of making a buck.

This was recommended to me back in 1976 when I was 19, has made all the difference in the world, has also made a profound difference to everyone I have ever suggested this to and helped through crisis (and still do now, 2016.) When everyone is running around with their heads cut off you'll be the calm one wondering what the fuss is all about... able to maintain perspective and focused on what's important and needs to be done personally and professionally when either or both worlds seem to be falling in on you... I've more than survived brain damage (more than once) , divorce, career ending disability, cancer, premature death of those closest to me.. things I never expected... and can say that which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger if you happen to have the right set of coping skills in your bag of tricks. When people marvel how I just keep on going and wonder how I do it.... and I say... read this book... Every moment you are alive is a gift, that's why its called the present. be happy, be well... make the most of what you do have.",11
Brian Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Funny name. Great book!," “Creative striving for a goal that is important to you as a result of your own deep felt needs, aspirations and talents (and not the symbols which the ‘Joneses’ expect you to display) brings happiness as well as success because you will be functioning as you were meant to function. Man is by nature a goal-striving being. And because man is ‘built that way’ he is not happy unless he is functioning the way he was made to function—as a goal-striver. Thus true success and true happiness not only go together but each enhances the other.”

“Every human being has been literally ‘engineered for success’ by his Creator. Every human being has access to a power greater than himself.”

~ Maxwell Maltz from Psycho-Cybernetics

Psycho-Cybernetics. Funny name.

Great book! Maxwell Maltz was a world-renowned plastic surgeon who discovered that, while some people’s lives changed dramatically after he altered their appearance through plastic surgery, some people’s lives *didn’t*. He deduced that the primary factor that differentiated these groups was their self-image—not what they saw in the mirror but the images they had of themselves in their MINDS. Cool stuff.

He spent the second half of his career merging this self-image psychology with the then-popular science of “cybernetics”—which studies how things like guided missiles or “servo-mechanisms” hit their targets through a clear goal and constant adjustment of their course.

Here are some of the Big Ideas:

1. Cybernetics - Servo-mechanisms & you.
2. The Success Instinct - We’ve all got it!
3. Imagination - The first key.
4. Dehypnotize Yourself! - Starting now. :)
5. Rational Thought - How to use it.

Here’s to getting our Psycho-Cybernetic on as we set inspired goals, imagine our ideals, take action as we correct inevitable mistakes and practice FEELING our success. :)

Elias,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,"Self Image, the true success book","I have had many obstacles throughout life. The reasons for my obstacles finally dawned upon me through the wise words of Bob Proctor, as he mentioned the self image. He recommended a book on it, by Maxwell Maltz. Anyone who wants to make a change, a true change, this book is for you. If it's losing that weight for real, or getting that confidence, or daring to do amazing & out of the comfort zone things, then as mentioned THIS IS FOR YOU! Changing your self image and having an honest look on your self, will not only improve the quality of your life but those around you as well.

Nafiz Elgun,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,The best self book on mindset EVER!,"This book was recommended by a millionaire mentor of mine. This book has already started to help me immensely turn my brain and thoughts into an asset instead of it being a battlefield of negative thoughts and having the self image of myself as being unworthy and not believing in myself.

I remember reading reviews for this book only 2 months ago and trying to convince myself not to take the plunge despite all of the people saying this book changed their life.

Well...it was one of the best decisions I have made. And i confidently know I will use the practices in this book for the rest of my life to be a happy, confident, and strong goal-attacking person. Dr. Maltz's guidance is already starting to ring in my head almost daily.

I value the mental benefits of this book in the thousands honestly.

Just get it. Start. Do the practice exercises. Don't be judgmental of it and it will work for you.",2
WWF,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Salesmen and sports,"This Dan Kennedy revision of Maxwell Maltz's original Pscyho-cybernetics is in my opinion so geared towards salesmen and sports that if you're not a salesman, athlete, sports fan or an avid golfer, the text can be hard to get through. Sadly, Maltz's original version of Psycho-cybernetics is not offered as a Kindle book, which is why I bought this one.
Maltz's original, which I read as a teenager in the 70s, also featured athletes and salespeople, but Maltz was more inclusive in his approach. This new version should be entitled something like ""Psycho-cybernetics for Salesmen and Sports."" Salesmen and sports are great and important, but potential readers should at least be given some indication that Kennedy has taken Maltz's book so heavily in that direction so that they can decide whether or not it's really for them.",13
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Top 10 of all time.,"This is one of those few books that put forth a new idea that has not only stood the test of time but has been woven into the fabric of the entire self development industry. It's up there with ""Think and Grow Rich"" and "" How to win friends and influence people"".

It starts slow and after 2 or 3 chapters I was beginning to question the purchase. ""There is nothing to DO"" I thought. Then after it got going I felt there was TOO MUCH to do. Lots of excersises.

Of course, like so many things, the crux is in the application. Will you use it?

I think the thing I liked best is that you can really hear Dr Maltzs' passion for humanity and sincere desire to help. He seems like a wonderful man.

Also that he isn't in the pie-in-the-sky ""anyone can do anything"" camp. He teaches us to be truthful about our actual limitations, which do have limits, but are far above what most people do or even aspire to.

I put this on a short Must Read list of a handful of classics and consider it a must for anyone pursuing their full potential.

I bough this book for less than 10 dollars and I must say, this is one of the best investments I have ever made. Easy to read, this book's ideas MAKE SENSE and are profound. I'd like to save my biggest reviews for one chapter only: Unlock your personality. I read this chapter at time when I was depressed, because I didn't get along with people too well. I was reserved, shy and was a social dud. My entire college years, I've been a social dud. My social life sucked. It sucked because I didn't know how to get along with people - I was irritable with people and might have appeared mean to many. The chapter: Unlock your personality might have changed my life. To follow the chapter and its advices precisely requires faith in yourself. A great leap indeed. Don't think, says the late Dr. Maltz -and act. Thinking only complicates things further. Don't think, don't over analyze yourself and just BE. It might as well be a magic bullet. It was for me, I think. Read that chapter over, and over, and over and it will eventually click. Be yourself is the message - and don't think. In social situations, don't think - and just be. Just be. Read the chapter, and you will understand what I mean. ;)",14

Guillermo Velez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Worth the try for the cost,"Facts: It rook me months to do a decent job to relax and use the techniques described in the book. More than one reading and reading into details were necessary for me to grasp the right way to visualize what I wanted. The essentials of the book probably could me summarized in one chapter but the book includes a lot of examples, typical of this type of books. I did not achieve much the first couple of months on my first goal of reach my ideal weight. Then, my wife got me into a weight loss program and now I am well on my way to reach my goal. I keep doing the relaxation and visualization of reaching my ideal weight.

Opinion: I seek for a way to ""program"" the subconscious for a long time and this is the closest thing I have found. I started with a goal and the right tool just came along and I do not believe in coincidences. The weight loss program is making me loss weight. The techniques described in the book makes me follow the program with a very high level of discipline. The desire to reach my target weight is so high that I am able to sort almost all challenges I face to deviate from the weight loss program. I think that for the cost of the book is worth the try if you believe that you are a person of habit, that you behavior is ruled by your subconscious and you need to program that subconscious mind to change your behavior and achieve your goal",1

I knew it was a good book the minute I read ""You are not inferior. You are not superior. You are YOU"". I knew it was a good book when I read about how Maltz dismisses obtaining positive self image through ""willpower"". How many of you have heard well-meaning friends and coworkers say ""think positive"" about something that troubles you? How many of you have wondered why this well-meaning advice seldom helps? Maltz hits the nail on the head when he tells, and illustrates, why willpower and forcing positive thoughts into your head does not work. AND....he specifically tells you how to change your thought process so the positive thoughts come naturally. He gives you simple (but important) exercises to help you obtain and use the concepts he teaches.

I am a firm believe that once you have a positive image, life seems to turn out better. Not only does it look better through clear (instead of mud-shaded) glasses....but your new found self image will help you get the things you want. It will give you the power to go after what you want because you finally feel worthy. Instead of brainwashings and piecemeal advice, Maltz lays a solid groundwork using pure logic as to why YOU are worthy, and how you can convince yourself of this fact. He even gives concrete visuals to aid his lessons (healing emotional scars, much like facial scars). Emotional facelift.

The sooner in life you can get these perspectives, the better for you and your loved ones. The theme in each chapter tends to develop somewhat slowly. Maltz tends to gather various points, from many different authors and sources, and takes some pages so that they coalesce into very significant and meaningful approaches to life that have immense practical value. And this is a workbook, meant to be used as a guide for your own personal work, which we all need to do very much of. Just reading it quickly through and moving on to the next book would be a huge waste.

Now I will always have one and extras for several friends! It's great for ocassional reference. I believe I would recommend it to anyone 12 years or older, who are prepared to improve their lives.",4

Little Commandlet,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,A Life Transformed,"I'm barely on page 66 and couldn't wait to write a review. After only 66 pages my life is starting to turn around for the better. I've gotten a promotion at work and praises from family and friends over my willingness to act and striving for success. The principles applied in this book will change anyone open enough listen. Effort, willpower, man on the street white knuckling your way through is not the way. One must have a sense of surrender and instead of letting fear stand in tour way, put that fear behind you and let it push you forward. I can personally atest that this book works!",1
J,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,one of the most powerful books you will ever read,"honestly, quit wasting your money on cheesy current generation self help books like ""the secret"" or ""the power of now"". i'm only 26 and this book has helped me profoundly, increased my levels of happiness, self confidence, pretty much curbed my general anxiety levels, and has me looking at life from a whole new perspective. the author maxwell maltz wrote a book like this from the bottom of his heart, and you feel how contagious it is coming off the pages. i also have it on audiobook and listen to it going to and from work. it makes a difference trust me, because i NEVER write book reviews on amazon. i've only read it three times in the past month since i've had it and am now reading ""zero resistance selling"" by the same author and will also be purchasing ""zero resistance living"", the 90 day program, from the psycho-cybernetics.com site. if you want to understand why you act the way you do, why you perceive yourself the way you do, how you can gradually change that and KEEP it that way, and have plenty of aha moments about yourself, get this book. don't misunderstand, you will have to put in the work like anything else in life, but you WILL end up recommending it to everyone you know after you read it, believe me. my mom and my brother have now both read it and have both wondered why they didn't stumble upon this sooner, and they are practically non-readers. you are worth it, get on this already.",5
Mr H,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,A great book.,"Before ""The Law Of Attraction"", there was simply this book.

A great book.",1
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Still A Great Book,"I originally read this as a condensed book in Reader's Digest magazine back in the early 1960's, and then bought the book itself. After several moves, it was lost. I recently repurchased it due to it's past impact on my thinking. A primary point that the late Dr. Maltz emphasized was his observation that plastic surgery had unexpected results with different people. For some, a minor correction caused a major personality change for the better. For others, even where the cosmetic change was more pronounced, the person's personality changed little, if at all. He attributed this to the person's innner / self image. Another key point was the power of visualization, that, if vivid / realistic enough, can have the same effect on the brain as if actually seeing / doing, a point now used regularly in sports training, et al. Both these points and others helped me immensely through my teen years and into early adulthood to break out of my ""shell"", and minimize the tendency to prejudge outcomes or approach change / the unknown negatively. The fact that his book continues to sell, and that there are several spin-offs, is testimony to the timelessness of these points.",4

Shantel Ruiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Straight Shooter,"In an effort to understand why I have a strong tendency to ""doubt"" myself in many situations where I rationally know I excel, I bought this book and read it cover to cover.
I found the author Dr. Maltz to be incredibly insightful and the no nonsense way he delivered the information was rather refreshing. I've read my fair share of ""self help"" books and I can honestly
say that most of them carry on a lot about psychological mumbo jumbo, but NOT this one! Dr Maltz is a serious straight shooter and he really just says it like it is. I found many of the ideas he presented to cause ""ah ha"" moments inside me and the information is also very relevant, even in todays world which at first I thought might be an issue since this book was written many years ago. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a way to better understand their self-image and in essence make it better.
By far my favorite part of the book is the idea he delivers that we don't need to dredge up our past and relive it and ""figure it out"" in order to get over it. He just basically says, forget it, and move on! I LOVED THAT!! It makes me feel free from past baggage that I thought may have been holding me back. Really a great book!
If i had to say something negative, it would be that the font was kind of small ;)",3

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Best book for self development I've found,"I have been studying psychology for the past 3 years at least, and have delved into topics such as NLP, hypnosis, destructive patterns etc. I have studied each of these topics and more in great depth and detail, and have to say that this book is by far the most treasured possession I own. This book is what I consider to be the answer, the key to all of self development. If you want to accomplish ANYTHING and you are not, there is a reason for it, and this book can help you. If you will read it, and then re-read it, and then re-read it, until you begin to fully understand and comprehend the principles and concepts presented, it will change your life....dramatically.

The book's whole premise is that we all behave not according to how things actually are, but how we perceive them to be. As a result of this, our beliefs can be very skewed, and thus our behavior will be as well. It is the task of this book to teach and instruct the reader in how to recognize irrational beliefs, use rational conscious thought to determine what they want to believe instead, and then use principles such as ""theater in the mind"" and ""acting as if"" to create a new reality experienced by your mind, which will program your self image, and thus create a new objective reality around you.

My personal opinion is that this book contains the key, the solution to any problem you are currently having, which you want to change but don't know how to, or are unsure of where to start. I highly recommend it.",8
Gadgeteer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,"Written decades ago, but still pertinent","Dr. Maltz, originally a face surgeon, came to recognize in his patients a need for a positive self image, which need transcended the physical characteristics that patients wanted improved.

He compares the methodology of achieving a desired improvement in one's self image with that used in the design of modern physical automatic control systems (he uses the term ""Cybernetics"" to describe the servomechanism systems of his day, such as those used in military fire control systems).

The concept is imaginative, and Dr. Maltz uses most of his book to describe various methods for helping change one's self image to the one that is desired, presumably by using negative feedback control to minimize the difference between one's current self image and one's desired self image, similar in concept to how military fire control systems operate.

While the basic ideas presented by Dr. Maltz are intriguing the human brain is so much more complex than the design of a military fire control system that the basic concepts presented must be taken with this important limitation in mind.

The fact that book is still in print after many decades and has sold many millions of copies, however, is a tribute to some validity of Dr. Maltz's basic concepts.",3

Gina Battiste,4.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Very good and intetesting book,Very good and intetesting book. I would give it a ive if it got to the point quicker. Felt like there was a little filler fluff. But not nearly as much as many other self help books.,2
Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Great book,"I purchased the updated version of this book first (edited by Dan Kennedy), and then bought this one. I would definitely recommend this one, because although Dan Kennedy means well, the updated version just has too much stuff in it, and it's easy to lose sight of the forest for all the trees, so to speak. This book has all the nuts and bolts of psycho cybernetics in it, and you won't need another one if you really study and read it.
If you're really trying to change your life, or a certain habit, or any other kind of personal change, this is the book for you. It's the science of how the mind works - and it's more fundamental than anything by Tony Robbins, The Secret, Hypnosis, and NLP. This book is extravagant and foundational for personal change and I'd recommend it with the highest level I possibly could for everyone. I've bought 5 extra copies, and gave them away to friends and family; that's how impressed I am with it.",9

Psychocybernetics doesn't teach you what to think, but HOW to think in such a way that your entire life will be transformed. Improve yourself in any area, sports, your job, your love life, simply by readjusting your approach to the world. Maxwell Maltz exposes the secrets of how powerful our thoughts are. And he offers scientific proof to back it up. Maxwell Maltz tells it better than most anybody else I've read.

I first encountered this book back in the early 80's. I didn't know it then but my life was being transformed into something pretty amazing and this was one of the books that helped me change the entire course of my life.

Phil Saparov,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Life-changing read,"I used the advice presented in this book to bring about major change with great results at least twice.
First, when I sprained my knee and tore my ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament), I used the concept of striving towards a goal and thinking of my physical body as a servo-mechanism to heal myself. Where I got the method of healing is a whole 'nother story. But the concept of driving yourself towards an image of Health instead of trying to get away from disease really helped.

It no longer mattered what exactly was wrong with my knee - whether it was a partial or complete tear, or whether one or two menisci had been torn, and to which degree. The idea was to focus on the solution instead of the problem. It took me about 3 months to get back to living a normal life, where I could dance, run, and even do heavy squats again.

The second time I used this concept was when I had completely exhausted my system as a result of emotionally and physically draining work that I had been doing for a long time and for too many hours per week. At some point, all of a sudden, I got a whole host of physical and emotional problems, the worst of which was a pretty severe case of depression.

I changed my job, and went in for different therapies, some of which helped to a degree. But I attribute most of the success, especially in the emotional part, to Psychocybernetics. You see, different therapists analyzed my condition and tried to heal each of the causes that might have had an ill effect on me. This made me focus too much on the causes, which were the problem, instead of focusing on the solution.

Once again, I armed myself with Psychocybernetics and went to work. It took me about 3-4 months to feel almost 100% again. But the most important thing that I remember was that as soon I started to focus on the image of health and think about all the things I would do as soon as I was better, that's when my healing really took off.

Buy it. Use it.
Best,

Phil Saparov",13

I've only been using this method a couple of months, but it is nicer. Some hypnotists recommended to me that I get an older edition of this book, one that has not been messed with by any other additional authors, so I got this one.

Arwen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,This is the one!,"After spending some years on intense personal development ,I finally got this book. I'd heard about it since I was young. But, never read it. I should have.

It is the granddaddy of personal development books. Truly an inspired, powerful piece of writing. BUT, do get the original version. Despite the years and social changes, this is the one to read.",1
dr_shock,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Classic book to get your sh$% together.,"It is important to get one's stuff together. This is a timeless book written by a very perceptive individual. Many paths lead to his conclusions. I'm not a religious person and it is clear that Maltz is, which would normally irritate me. However, the content of this book is very pragmatic and refreshing.

I don't think anyone can get much out of this book if they don't do the exercises and re-visit these ideas on a regular basis. It is a great book for gaining awareness of one's self image. For the price, I recommend this book to anyone. And I do so frequently.",1

Reynaldo Vasquez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Five Stars,Love this book! It is now one of my right living text books!,1
Martin Zakostelsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Classic masterpiece still shining,"After reading quite a few self-help and self-examination books, this is the book I was waiting for. Although at first I was quite skeptical because of the age of the book (I though ""Would there be something new for me, would the ideas be still valid?""), after first several pages doubts dissolved and I was entirely caught.

I believe all the reviews have said already enough, so I'll keep my review short. This book has all that I want from it:
- Down-to-earth style without exaggerations. Yet very strong and moving content, explaining how human brain works, what brings us happiness/more life, and how to achieve it.
- Positive :o). Gives reader so much energy into his life.
- No easy-read. Should be read definitely more times than once.

Simply put, this is a must read in the area of self-help/psychology books.

Some of favorite quotes:

""The self-image is changed, for better or worse, not by intellect alone, nor by intellectual knowledge alone, but by ""experiencing."" Wittingly or unwittingly you developed your self-image by your creative experiencing in the past. You can change it by the same method. "" (page x)
""One of the most pleasant thoughts to any human being is the thought that he is needed, that he is important enough to help and add to the happiness of some other human being."" (page 97)

""Since man is a goal striving being, he is functioning naturally and normally when he is oriented toward some positive goal and striving toward some desirable goal. Happiness is a symptom of normal, natural functioning and when man is functioning as a goal-striver, he tends to feel fairly happy, regardless of circumstances."" (page 101)

""Our habits are not accidental, or happenstance. We have them because they fit us. They are consistent with our self-image and our entire personality pattern. When we consciously and deliberately develop new and better habits, our self-image tends to outgrow the old habits and grow into the new pattern. "" (page 108)

""To give the other person credit for being sincere, if mistaken, rather than willful and malicious, can do much to smooth out human relations and bring about better understanding between people. Ask yourself, ""How does this appear--to him?"" ""How does he interpret this situation?"" ""How does he feel about it?"" Try to understand why he might ""act the way he does."""" (page 115)

""Man maintains his balance, poise, and sense of security only as he is moving forward--or seeking. When you think of yourself as having attained the goal, you become static, and you lose the security and equilibrium you had when you were moving towards something. The man who is convinced that he is ""good"" in the absolute sense, not only has no incentive to do better, but he feels insecure because he must defend the sham and pretense."" (page 137)

""Regardless of your feelings, force yourself to mix and mingle with other people. After the first cold plunge, you will find yourself warming up and enjoying it if you persist. Develop some social skill that will add to the happiness of other people: dancing, bridge, playing the piano, tennis, conversation. It is an old psychological axiom that constant exposure to the object of fear immunizes against the fear. As the lonely person continues to force himself into social relations with other human beings--not in a passive way, but as an active contributor--he will gradually find that most people are friendly, and that he is accepted. His shyness and timidity begin to disappear. He feels more comfortable in the presence of other people and with himself. The experience of their acceptance of him enables him to accept himself."" (page 139)

""If responding and reacting to negative feedback does not take us further down the road to our own goal--or serve our ends, then there is no need to respond at all. And, if response of any kind gets us off course, or works against us--then no response is the appropriate response."" (page 199)

""If life adapts itself in so many varied forms to act as a means toward an end, is it not reasonable to assume that if we place ourselves in the sort of goal-situation where more life is needed, that we will receive more life?"" (page 261)",7

Just put your doubts aside and BUY THIS BOOK today.
Right now while you are thinking about it. The sooner you get it, the sooner you will benefit from its simple effective techniques.
Whatever you do, don't put it off for tomorrow. You know you will just forget about it and then it will be a MAJOR OPPORTUNITY LOST.
Just make the simple effort right now to order a copy and you will be buying a lotto ticket that is virtually certain to PAY OFF BIG for you.
It costs [very little money] and if applied even a little bit, it is likely to change your life. How many other things that cost [this little] can you say that about.
The original edition DID change MY life about 10 years ago and I know at least 5 other people who point to this book (and another classic-Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill) as major keys to their personal philosophy and success in life.
This revised edition is even better than the original due to the care put into it by Dan Kennedy, who is keeping Dr. Maltz's work alive for the present generation with this timely update.
I liked it so much I have bought 5 more copies for some great business associates as gifts.

Put the techniques that have made many ordinary people appear to be extraordinary to work for you. You don't have to work harder, you just need to apply these amazing principals to your current methods and your will be so much more effective.
I also highly recommended ""Zero Resistance Selling"" for sales persons as a companion to this book which specializes the same techniques to Sales careers.",9

J. K. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,This book is different`,"It's so easy to see how this book has sold over 30,000,000 copies. I can honestly say that I think this book has ended my search for the ""perfect"" self-help book.
After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to buy this book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I've had the book for one week now and I am already seeing results.
About 3 years ago I entered into the world of sales and all of a sudden I became painfully aware of my self-image or my self-esteem as others call it. I became very self-conscious and started down a slippery slope into the world of negative thinking and emotions that weren't helping me at all.
So I did what any person would do who wants to overcome their limiting beliefs and learn how to overcome negative thinking and I started buying self-help litereature. my library is chocked full of books from all the greats. Well I learned something from all the books that I read, but I just felt there was always something missing. I didn't feel like I had the information that I needed to really turn it all around. I tried ""Affirmations"" etc. with marginal results.
Then I found this book. Maxwell talks about how we act, feel and perform is in direct relation to how we imagine ourselves to be. You may need to read that last sentence again because it's what helped me to start putting it all together. He then gives techniques for changing your self-image and overcoming your negative thinking that really works.
I'm very grateful to Maxwell for writing this book. He really put his heart into it and made a masterpiece!
Please don't make the mistake of not buying this book. It could well be the best money you ever spent! God Bless!",21

I bought the new psycho-cybernetics and am greatly disappointed with it. It tries to be too much, almost like they've tried to add several unrelated ""books"" of unrelated info to psycho-cybernetics. There are stories and additional paragraphs of information that you're not quite sure what to do with and it clouds the original ideas. Anyone can make a book longer with lots of extra info but a nicely summarized and boiled down series of thoughts is difficult to do so get the original because that's what it is; I just ordered the original again and will leave this ""updated"" copy in the hotel I'm staying in right now.",22

LindaT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,A Good Thing Made Even Better,"I heard about the first PSYCHO CYBERNETICS book in the 60's (yes, I am over 21 years old) and when I read it I thought it was wonderful. In fact, I thought that if I only would be able to have one self-help book, it would be this one.
THE NEW PSYCHO CYBERNETICS has taken a good book and made it even better. The masterful editing and adapting by Dan Kennedy is great. It still is done in the voice of the original author, Dr. Maxwell Maltz, but it has up to date examples of people most of us know from this time in history, yet it still includes the examples Dr. Maltz wrote about in his original book.
The theme hasn't changed -- Dr. Maltz claimed that the human mind has a ""servo-mechanism"" which can help us accomplish what we desire, but we must let it do its work once the desire is ""fed into"" the mind. He drew upon his knowledge of the then fledgling work of computers. And now in the 21st century, computers have advanced in an unbelievable manner, and yet the principle behind which they work is still the same; the goal-striving mechanism which works towards its teleological end by negative feedback, correction, and positive feedback.
I have other self help books, but for me, this one is the basis on which all the others are carried out.
I can't recommend it highly enough.",23

N/A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,"Solid, Disciplined ""Self-Improvement"" Book","Unlike many other New Age type books which talks about self-elevating, self-magnificating, self-actualising, self-meditative and all that crap, this book gives some good solid ground rules on creating a strong positive mindset that will help one better oneself with practice.
This book is a modern treatment of Maltz's original book and has made it even more palatable and applicable in daily life. The exercises are simple, straightforward and effective. One just needs to practice.
You're not reading this book to be enlightened to salvation or something (which you can read the Holy Bible for!) but rather, this book prepares your mind to set goals in the daily routine of life. It is about setting goals, and consciously thinking how you could achieve them, letting your subconscious autopilot ""servo-mechanism"" help you on the way there through deliberate practical exercises. This book is even more readable than the original.
Very readable, very practical, and no ""mind power"" mystical nonsense. Just straight cut practical tips to sharpen the mind.",12
Ramon Acosta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,The first and foremost,"Without a doubt, Dr. Maltz' classic is still on top of the heap of self-help books, tapes and seminars available. Everything that was relevant in late 1950 and early 1960 is still relevant today. Unless humans fundamentally change the way the brain operates, this book will be a classic text on the process of communicating with and reprogramming the inner self.

There's only one downside about this book. If you don't try the mental techniques, nothing will change. You might manufacture a new line of thinking after absorbing the material, but if you don't practice and apply it on a near daily basis, then you've merely read one of the greatest psychology texts of all time. A bit of mental elbow grease will instead allow you to experience this book and the profound change you and your loved ones can all potentially benefit from.",7

Rubin Wald,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Great Update of a Classic!,"Dan Kennedy has done a brilliant job of giving Dr. Maltz's classic text a contemporary feel while remaining true to the original version.
I still have my 1974 Pocket Book edition of Psycho-Cybernetics and its ideas and insights helped me a lot in understanding life and success and how I could control my own destiny.
This updated version is even better! I especially liked the PRESCRIPTION and MENTAL TRAINING EXERCISE boxes that Mr. Kennedy has strategically placed throughout the book. They contain very clear suggestions and practical exercises for living an abundant and fulfilling life. For example, he prescribes keeping a ""success diary"" as a tool for building a stronger self-image. And on page 201, there is an powerful exercise for developing the all important habit of forgiveness.
One of the insights Dr. Maltz gave me that helped clarify my own life journey was his understanding that our unconscious minds cannot distinguish between a real experience and the same experience vividly imagined. Years later I found confirmation for this idea in Quantum Physics.
Nobel Prize winning Physicist Niels Bohr's Complementarity Principle shows us that the mental aspect of an imagined experience is complementary to its physical aspect. Both are equally 'real'. No wonder imagination and visualization are such valuable skills to master for anyone who wants to transform their dreams into physcial reality.
I wonder if Dr. Maltz and Dr. Bohr ever had a conversation!
Dan Kennedy has done a tremendous favor for anyone who wants knowledge and practical applications for being more successful. I applaud his efforts.",38

I am proud to say this is the first book that I have completed all the way through in over a year. I bought this book back in 2009 when I was fighting the boredom in Iraq and remember only reading a few chapters. After I learned that it was a recommended reading by some of the leaders in Empower Network, I decided to dust it off and see how the top earners have used this book to unlock their success mechanisms and start living a more fulfilling life.

And boy, I'm glad I did!

This powerful book has provided so much value to my life. I now know the power of imagination and have started to imagine successful outcomes when going through a sales presentation, public speaking presentations, and any areas of my life that I'm not completely comfortable and confident in.

And let me tell you the concepts in Psycho Cybernetics works!

I've had my best month in personal training sales at the gym with over $3,000 in sales in just the first 3 weeks. One sale worth $1,950. My previous best was $1,800 for the full month.

Individualic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,I was IN it. It changed my views,"My mind was turned, and given a direct mention.
There are parts that give clarity to what most parents, or coaches don't tell you that well.

The advice on happiness and forgiveness are something of a new-age, but conventional, as well.
I understood every part of it, and it is a book I look back into.

1) After reading, I took a different approach to my world
2) Before reading, I hadn't known some of the topics, and their expenditure
3) While reading, I was hooked. I could keep going for its lessons

I'm a scientific theorist who ranks as a ""genius"", and has published his own book.

This new edition is, amazingly enough, even better than the original. It's clearer, easier to follow, and even more compelling. I'll always be grateful to the person who recommended this to me when I was 20 years old. Twenty two years later, I'm living a life most people only dream of.

A User,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Better Than the Original; Max Would Have Been Proud,"Greetings:
Join us at the Psycho-Cybernetics discussion group on [...]
To date, I have bought three hardcover editions of the New Psycho-Cybernetics (NPC): one I gave to a friend, one I take with me to read during the day, and one I keep in my home office to work with on those days when I work at home. I have found it a significant improvement upon the original. (I have used up three paperback versions of the original over the last 10 years.)
I remember when I first read the original version of PC, in around 1990. I thought it was somewhat hokey. I used to be an engineer, and I thought it somewhat strange to try to apply feedback control systems theory to people. We are not machines, after all.
The strange thing, though, was that the system worked for me. Still, I was somewhat embarrassed about the whole thing, so I sort of kept my dabbling to myself.
Then, in the mid-late nineties, I read Fritjof Capra's book, The Web of Life. In that book, Capra talks a lot about systems theory, and he also goes into the history of the original cybernetics group (not Psycho cybernetics, but rather a group of mathematicians, psychologists, biologists, and physicists who collaborated in WWII to create anti-aircraft guns that could effectively track and destroy enemy aircraft). In his discussion, Capra explains that the original cybernetics group's goal was to try to make machines that could do what people and animals do naturally and easily, without conscious thought. They tried to do this, in part, by observing the actions of animals and people. Based on such observation, the group devised the early foundation of what became our modern science of systems control as used in almost every modern electrical/mechanical system.
What Maltz tried to do was take a bit of the science and art of systems control and apply it back to people, in an attempt to improve their functioning. I think one of the original cyberneticists, Norbert Weiner, also tried to do this in his book, The Human Use of Human Beings, but I could be wrong.
Anyway, because Psycho-Cybernetics is based on systems theory, in contrast to other types of ""self help"" or positive thinking books, it recognizes that a person trying to achieve her goals is going to fail, and miss what she is pursuing, probably many times on her way to her destination. Rather than candy coating this fact and suggesting ""positive thinking,"" PC suggests feedback control system oriented techniques to use, deal with, and not be completely stymied by such failures.
It also provides techniques to help one deal with ""drama queen"" co-workers and supervisors who seem to go out of their way to provide damaging negative feedback (e.g., ignoring negative feedback in ch. 11, ""How to Unlock Your Real Personality""), or retarding how fast responds to negative feed back (e.g., delaying the response, as in ch. 12 ""Do It Yourself Tranquilizers that Bring Peace of Mind."").

Now, on to the new version of PC: my own opinion is that it is better than the original. Dan follows the original structure of the PC book, and much of the text is in common. However, Dan has buttressed that text with additional examples taken from the many hours of recordings and reams of Maltz' notes that Dan owns. In addition, Dan also provides many practical examples of the successful application of PC techniques that have arisen since the original version of the book was published in 1960.
Try NPC. If, like me, you have areas in your life where you would like to do better, I think you will find it useful.",48

Picklegirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,This book was recommended...,"If you are familiar with the writings of Jane Roberts who channeled an entity called Seth, there is a set of books called the deleted sessions.

It's apparent that this book was written before drugs were prevelant in our society because there's no outlandish statements, no grey area, and it's actually down to earth and makes sense. If you lack confidence, or have a low self opion, this is by far the best self help book available...buy it.",11

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Life Changing,"Its easy to mock ""self help"" books like this. I do so regularly; but not this one.

Get this book it will change your life and the way you think. You want to change your life start working on changing the way you think.,1
Susil Manchanayaka,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Understand Yourself,"I bought this book and read it. It is interesting for many reasons. I am a lover of books and I am married to books (metaphorically). Why I say that this book is interesting is that it is life changing. The few dollars I spent on this book is worth and I learnt a lot by reading this book. The chapters are shorter and easy to grasp. Some ideas may be unfamiliar to a novice reader but if you are an experienced and an avid reader, you can get at the gist of the book.

Many people have complexes (psychological) and they struggle to come out of the shell they live in. This book helps you to see the world as it is and you can transform your life with ideas from the book. The ideas in the book are worth remembering and practicing. If you are into understanding the nature of human mentality, behavior and why people do certain things but why they are afraid of doing certain things is interesting. In our lives we undergo numerous pains and we sometimes become depressed and helpless. This book helps anyone to see the world as it is.

The writer is an experienced professional in his field and particularly this book helps one to be motivated, enthusiastic in anything she does and develop confidence. He is a leading scholar and a much respected counselor. I read about his biography on the net and I was very impressed. He is an authority on his subject. I can say that this book is a booster - it boosts your performance. It is light reading.

Maltz takes the reader into an unexplored area of human mentality, how to overcome fears, the basis of fear and personal development. He helps the reader overcome fears. He argues that most of the fears we have are all baseless and unscientific. Fears come out of ignorance. Fears come out of wrong perceptions we have. Fears come out of not being exposed to the world we live in. That is what he says.

The book is pocket sized and you can carry it when you travel. It is like a handbook on personal development. If you have any interest in mentoring, counseling, public speaking or teaching, this is the next book you may consider reading.

I personally like the ideas in the book. The time you may spend will be worth the trouble you take to read this book. The chapters in it are short and run into a couple of pages and at a single sitting you can read a chapter. Make this book a partner in your life. It is worth buying and keeping in your private library. In life one may experience ups and downs. Tribulations in life are part of human existence on this planet. We seek advice from others, counselors, teachers or if you belong to a profession of respect - mentors. This book is a companion mentor. If you are in need of some expert advice, consult this book. Discuss what is in it. It will pay rich dividends.

The final verdict on the book is that it is a book of interesting ideas for us to be human. It is a book that teaches us how to face life. It is a book that teaches us live happily. It is a book that teaches us how to help others in need. My friends, read it. You will soon see a dramatic transformation in your life. It is life changing and mind changing. The contents of the book are to be digested (metaphorically). The ideas in the book by Maltz (the writer) will enlighten you all.

N/A,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,bizzare...,"My big problem with this book is the material that Dan Kennedy added. While it provides useful background and some updated examples, Kennedy weaves it in seemlessly into the old material. What you get is confusion. The first person of Kennedy is mixed in with the first person of Maltz, without being differentiated in any way! So in the same section, you have someone speaking of ""my patients"" in the '40's or '50's, and then the same voice speaking of ""my experiences"" with a Kevin Costner movie or a Michael Jordan anecdote. There is no change in typeface, or paragraph structure to indicate that different people are writing, one long-dead, the other alive and ""editing"" this book. Why didn't Kennedy's editor make him place his commentary separately?
This was enough to spoil most of the usefulness of this edition for me. I suggest noting the boxed exercises that Kennedy includes, which are useful, and then reading the original of the book.",53

Jon Torodash,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,A pioneer in the field still standing strong,"I don't make it a habit to read self-help books, but the off-color fitness guru Matt Furey has made a killing on selling a program based off of Maltz's work, and most other ""motivational speakers"" usually bend a knee in respect to Maltz as a forerunner. So I picked up a cheap used copy and read it cover to cover. The only question I have left is why anyone would bother with any of the other crap. This book effectively condenses the entirety of the self-help field. As far as I can tell, this is as good as it gets by the standards of the genre, is enjoyably accessible to a general audience, and has weathered time's attack on its relevance stunningly well.

Firstly, Maltz had the raw clinical experience necessary to write this kind of book. As a crackerjack plastic surgeon he saw immediately and firsthand the life-changing or life-stalling power of self-image at work in the faces of his patients. (And anyone who scoffs at unorthodox contributors to a research field ought to know that Albert Einstein was working for the Swiss patent office when he submitted the Theory of Special Relativity.) Yet Maltz also admits where exactly the limits of his knowledge lie rather than try to convince the reader of his omniscience.

Secondly, Maltz was receptive to many fundamental tenets of psychology and philosophy and works them into Psycho Cybernetics clearly and without contradiction. Nor does he try to repackage ancient metaphysical hokum with inane and feeble examples.

Thirdly, there are no workshops, special reports, live phone help, or products to buy. (Though I cannot speak for the organization that has cropped up around Maltz's name.) All pretense and exaggeration for marketing purposes seem absent from his book.

Maltz was definitive and unequivocal in his ideas, quick to set a standard and stick to it. He took seriously some very fundamental issues of life and makes clear statements. This book rises high above the haphazard pop philosophy/ethics smeared all over mass media which are either shallow and weak or imperiously stupid. Maltz simply faced the truth of his own convictions. Psycho Cybernetics by no means outlines life management skills as an exact science, but its frank suggestions are intellectually compelling. Overall, the book is worthwhile because Maltz' honest and non-condescending style at least earns your respect, if not your belief.",467

Jay Johnson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Horribly Boring Book,"This book will put you to sleep. Unfortunately I bought it based on all the high reviews. I guess I missed something.

Each chapter seemed to ramble on and on. It is a lengthy book and it seems like a lot of the chapter content was redundant saying the same thing over. The book discusses one's self image, happiness, success and how to evaluate it in life.

The author has a section about SUCCESS (sense of direction, understanding, courage, charity, esteem, self confidence and self acceptance). However each of these bullet points were very basic principles. Same applies to his chapter on FAILURE (frustration, aggressiveness, insecurity, lonliness, uncertainty, resentment and emptiness). Again, very basic material.

For me the last third of the book was more boring than the other two-thirds. It was a hard book to finish being so uninteresting. I can't recommend this book.",6

Christian Rosenkreutz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics,Outdated psuedo-science,"I consider myself to be pretty open-minded, especially in regards to the potentials of the human mind, but this book actually reads like a laundry list of little ""fixes"" to do with your life, and reads more like a precursor to infomercial formats than to gaining any kind of insight whatsoever.

The author declares right away that he is not a psychologist, but considers himself qualified (and believe me, I am not a fan of the word ""qualified"" by any means) and continues to compare himself to Einstein, Madam Curie, Wright Brothers (should I have to mention all of their minds actually created advances that changes the entire world without question?) all in the preface, before you even get to the table of contents, which I will briefly list a few entries:

""your key to a better life""

""the success mechanism within you""

""first key to success mechanism""

""dehypnotize yourself""

""let your success mechanism work for you""

""habit of happiness""

""success-type personality""

""failure mechanism""

""how to give yourself an emotional facelift""

""do-it-yourself tranquilizers that bring peace of mind""

I won't go any further, although there are more. My problem is that not only is this self-proclaimed ""scientist/psychologist"" coining new terms, he does it in a very QVC way. I am all for understanding the programming we submit ourselves to, and ways to understand the mind, and patterns of thought, however this book is a waste of time, only for the mindless reader that in fact turns off their brain to read this book (the author actually asks you to do that while reading, its in one of the first chapters, right after he tries to convince the reader that ""telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition have been established by scientific laboratory experiments."" That is the actual sentence from page 24. I would be delighted by nothing more than to get ahold of these ""scientific laboratory experiments"" data records to see this for myself. Considering this was written over 45 years ago... well, everyone draws their own conclusions but please save your time and money.",45

The rest is filled with case studies that have bee refuted, ideas that are no longer valid and lots, and lots of God talk. When the author runs up against the wall of lack of evidence he just simply states ""and this is where science runs out so we need to turn to religion"". Instead of posing questions about what needs to come and pondering on the advancements that will be achieved by science he just simply states ""God made you this way now be happy with it."" You wouldn't consult a 2,000 year old medical journal for proper surgical procedures, so why would you try to apply the workings of 2,000 year old brains who thought the earth was flat and rain could be obtained with animal sacrifices and dances to modern brains?

Mindy Machanic,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I, Cyborg","Mostly about the guy, not much about the experiment","Don't bother. This guy is a systems and process engineer, a robotics genius - and a megalomaniac who thinks he does real science. Surprise! He went to do his experiment and discovered that there are rules to real science, like Human Subjects Protection laws. This is a guy who thinks that if you feed each group of 10 schoolkids a different breakfast for a month and find a 3 point difference in IQ in the group that ate bacon sandwches, that proves that bacon raises IQ. He mixes up his psychological, biological and philosophical concepts, mostly because he really doesn't seem to have much grounding beyond the logic of systems - and his own desire to become the first cyborg. That huge book, and 95% is ""me, I, me, I"" about his papers, his trips, his projects, his jobs, his TV appearances, his publicity.

The experiment isn't much. Big deal, he implanted a small array of electrodes in his lower arm with some wires attached, wore it around for 3 months, connected it to a computer once in a while, and then he ran some simple tests on it, the most important of which, in my estimation, was making the virtual hand work at a distance by moving his own hand - a nice future worth developing for robotics working in dangerous environments, something that didn't seem to have occured to him. The part about sending electrical currents from his hand to his wife's hand was interesting, but he imbued it with semi-mythical power. My question is, does it count as brain-to-brain electrical communication if the nerve stimulation doesn't pass through the brain but only works in the arm and spinal column, or just the arm to the implant? Issues he didn't consider because of his limited knowledge in anatomy, neuroanatomy (he had to open a textbook at every step of his experiment), etc.

I think cyborgs are coming, and I think neural control of objects is a good thing. I want to be able to write and make art from my brain directly, when that is possible, and would even be willing to volunteer to help along the way. But I don't think Warwick counts as the first real cyborg. He wasn't even the first implant - the first and second implants were done in 1996 by a group in Atlanta, headed up by Philip Kennedy (Science News, 1/29/05, p. 73). I think Warwick's effort was an engineer-being-a-science-dilettante publicity-hound's quick-and-dirty effort to grab a lot of ink and a Nobel Prize, which he thought to deny in the book - why bother to mention it if you're not thinking about it?

Read the news stories about his experiments, they get to the point faster. Read his books about robotics, which is where his expertise lies, if you're interested in his real work and significant ideas. Read other people's work on cyborgs. Check out the good work being done with blind people and paraplegics by different groups, work that goes into serious scientific looks at what Warwick just played with. They just don't write self-aggrandizing books about things, they go through peer review first!",29

Dr. Lee W. Bailey,3.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Human: Living with Robots and Cyborgs,"good condition book, terrible ideas","This book's thesis is a beastly, dangerous idea, to think that machines can someday exceed humans. It is a narrow, materialistic, mechanistic worldview that ignores basic human factors, such as a conscience. Do you think that a computer in a robot programmed to kill would reflect on the moral issue and refuse to kill? Or would you marry a robot? It could be programmed to say ""I love you,"" but would you believe it or think it sincere? Robot fans are projecting their own thinly veiled fantasy life, especially when they get into human desires such as sex and power.
This philosophy reflects a narrow consciousness in its believers. Robots are puppets, high-tech Pinocchios, not more than snazzy dolls and teddy bears, not serious models for humanity.

Mark Howells,2.0 out of 5 stars,Avatars of the Word: From Papyrus to Cyberspace,Interesting ideas in a mixed-up presentation,"There are without a doubt some brilliant ideas in this book. However, reading the book is a bit like mining for precious ore, you have to go through a lot of uninteresting rocks to get to the good stuff.
It would appear that the author had some serious ideas he wanted to publish and chose book format as conventional and lucrative. However, the book is a mish-mash of ideas that don't necessarily string together to form anything like a cohesive argument or narrative. While this non-linear presentation works well in cyberspace, it is a frustrating thing to deal with in book format.
It is heartening that a classics professor would tackle a subject like the change from print to electronic technology. His comparisons between the coming of the Internet and the rise of the codex in late antiquity are interesting. He clearly ""gets"" the Internet and doesn't consider it the big bad book-slayer.
The author sprinkles in some of his theories on education, particularly post-secondary. He poses interesting questions but provides no answers to those questions about the purpose of post-secondary education in the modern world.
Some of the ideas presented were compelling, the style of the book was difficult to handle, and his final comparisons between himself and Cassiodorus were a bit much. I could only give it two stars.",7

The author unfortunately brings a frequently annoying (and often stupid, see mention that Jar Jar Binks is ""blatantly racist"" on page 77 of the paperback for example) academic Leftism to the text. Includes a good treatment of peer to peer file sharing and an excellent discussion of culture as a ""living artifact"" (NOT the author's term).

There is much information to be read in articles, books and in the minds of academics who can give tid-bits of how we got to where we are today in a world of art and technology. But there are few people who can provide us with a rigorous account that actually has (1) depth and substance; and (2) an actual birthing of an era. This book provides us with both.

For the disciplined reader, Roy Ascott and Edward Shanken provide alluring, inventive and down right smart accounts of the time frame in which art evolved into a 21st century discipline; for the lazy reader, Roy Ascott's sentences are a crisp and inviting story of what it could behoove the artist to pay attention to.

David R Manegold,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Mono- and Multivariable Control and Estimation: Linear, Quadratic and LMI Methods (Mathematical Engineering) (English and Basque Edition)","Great Information, difficult to interpret at times","There are some nice pieces of information in this book that anyone with a good understanding of basic MIMO and state space control will appreciate. (the table of context is good and the reader can see if he or she is interested from them). However, the English translation is terrible and at times the text is extremely difficult to read. Virtually every paragraph has a major grammatical error. However, the math is clear and is presented nicely. Examples are good and the authors provide code (MATLAB) for their example work.

I would recommend this book to anyone who already is comfortable with basic state space control and is looking to augment their knowledge with some topics which are hard to find in many state-space control books. These authors consolidate them nicely into one publication.

Michael J. Tresca,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Cybergypsies : A True Tale of Lust, War, & Betrayal on the Electronic Frontier",Fragments,"Back when Indra Sinha was addicted to Shades, I was a kid sneaking into college computer labs to play Ivory Towers. We were both playing Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs). In fact, Ivory Tower players loathed Shades players with a passion, who were a bloodthirsty, violent lot - they came to Ivory Towers in waves when Shades was down and slaughtered everyone in sight with unbridled glee. It didn't give me a good impression of Shades.

That's not the impression Sinha gives in his book, The Cybergypsies. Sinha gives an aura of mystical wonder and beauty to a game in which stealing your opponents' weapon was commonplace--as if combat between medieval knights was all about wresting away your opponents' blade. It comes off as ridiculous as it sounds, but Sinha elevates it to poetic levels.

Cybergypsies isn't really about MUDding though. It's about Sinha's sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden, exemplified by the poor of Bhopal who were poisoned in an industrial disaster. Working in advertising, Sinha is in the unique position of trying to translate real-life suffering into everyday media. He finds the bizarre online reflection of the real world's struggles in Vortex, a role-playing MUSH.

In Vortex, like many MUSHs, the current players set the tone. And Vortex's tone is a decadent, anything-goes free love vibe that has a dark side. Cannibalism, baby sacrifice - you name it, the Vortex denizens have done it, reveling in their freedom to role-play anything and everything.

Somewhere in this contrast between MUDding and MUSHing, real-life oppression and cyber-decadence, Sinha struggles to save his marriage. Which is a bit odd, because Sinha makes almost no mention of his children. Speaking as someone who has a very active two-year-old, there's no way I can stay on the computer for more than a few minutes without him tugging on my arm. Sinha either seriously neglected them or intentionally removed them from the narrative; whatever the case, it's a glaring omission from his story of a family life brought to the brink by cyber-addiction.

The other problem is that Sinha is extremely well educated and enjoys demonstrating his knowledge in various allusions to disparate texts, often in other languages. Cybergypsies makes you feel dumb.

Sinha doesn't seem to have a point. Shades rises and falls. Vortex's appeal fades. Sinha raises awareness of global suffering through his advertising. He may even help a hacker access a nuclear plant, although it's never clear exactly what happened. And we can only guess that he saved his marriage...Sinha just ends the book without any resolution.

The author is a brilliant writer. But this book is a stream-of-consciousness journal made up of at least three other books, each which deserved its own focus. Readers looking for a parable on cyber-addiction, for a dialogue about human rights grievances, or for the wild and wooly history of the Internet will only get tantalizing glimpses.",4

rachel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Success-Cybernetics : Practical Applications of Human-Cybernetics,different,"I love US Anderson. His book, 3 Magic Words, changed my life in a profound way. I read another, The Magic in your Mind, which went a step further. It sounds hokey but it's actually full of unusual perspectives that kind of shake up and wake up your brain on a deeper level. I have referenced both of these books regularly for 30 years now.
Success Cybernetics is my third book.
I was shocked by the difference from the first 2 as it almost negates the validity of some of his previous premises. It was also written from a very hyper-masculine perspective to the point of being boldly sexist, even rationalizing abuse. While that may be a deal breaker for many women, understandably, I am a woman who wasn't quick to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I have been fascinated by the insights of this author and consider the personality and timeframe it was written in (early 70's but with a very 50's mentality.) It was obviously written for men exclusively, geared toward being more aggressive and as a result, more successful, but I still think there is great universal wisdom that applies to anyone that seeks it.
That having been said, the bit that caught my attention the most is the idea that 'people don't think, they react.' and they react in a way that they were programed or programed themselves unwittingly. To think is to be able to auto-correct by stopping bad habits and building new ones at will and he goes on to give you a process to do that. Thinking like this is rare and despite the reminders that it's written by a human being with human opinions, I find it quite valuable.",3

Wes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surviving Cyberwar,Great Reading - Important Reading,"The book was a little different than I expected. It provides a higher layer view of what's happening without going into fine technical detail. Many Americans feel that being security conscious is just being paranoid. This book dispels that myth and does a great job of explaining the types of Cyber Attacks that have occurred around the world. It's an eye opener. Because of this, it is very interesting reading and has the excitement of a novel.

Then the author does a great job of explaining how to protect yourself, your company, and your country from these ever present attacks.
Everyone thinks it won't happen to them - until it does.",2

Lee Gillette,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,"You've done it again, Mr. Maltz.","One of the first copies of Maxwell Maltz's book, Psycho-Cybernetics is still, to this day, on my bookshelf.

In 1961, It did much more than just put me on my quest for self-improvement. For the very first time, someone connected the mind to the body and brought home the old, simple adage ... ""Change your Mind and you change your life!""

That was Psycho-Cybernetics. That was the principle of Self Image Psychology ... proven and verified by science itself as an irresistible and powerful no nonsense psychology of happiness and fulfillment.

From there on ... for decades ... everything else that was printed in the Self Help Industry became supporting commentary for the principles in this book.

An now ... the new ""enhanced"" version of Psycho-Cybernetics just arrived. And Yesssss!!! I enjoyed this one as much as the original. If not more so!

Comparing the two, the new authors kept the voice and the insights of the original text intact, integrating only the updates needed for new generations to come to experience and cherish the joy of reading this old, new classic for the first time. And experience it, you will. You cannot do otherwise.

Indeed, it gives me great pleasure to recommend this new version of the book that's been around for over a half century. If you are not among the 35 million+ people who read the older one ... please, do yourself a favor ... get a copy now and read it!

You will find that Psycho-Cybernetics will do it to you, as it did it to us, decades ago. True to its kind, the new Enhanced version of Psycho-Cybernetics is still the only book that scientifically proves the principle of Self Image Psychology and makes it the new foundation for a new century's hope, success and the dream of a better life.

And the beat goes on!",43
Richard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,I've come across and read a lot from people like Jack Canfield,"I've been on a self-help reading kick for about the past year. Between issues in my finances, health, relationships, career, I was being weighed down by it all. I've come across and read a lot from people like Jack Canfield, Joel Osteen, Law of Attraction - Teachings of Abraham, etc. They were all good, uplifting and helpful works in their own right, but something was missing. I was listening to a podcast and the host mentioned this book, which was something I've never heard about - ever or anywhere. I looked it up on Amazon and decided to order it. I am sure glad I did. For me, it brought all of the other ideas, concepts and practices together. Things like affirmations, burning desires, faith, action - they all are great, as long as they're operating in conjunction with the way you see yourself and want to see yourself. This book really stresses the importance of focusing on your self-image, which is something I've found many of the other works glossed over or lacked. It's a good work, laced with some biblical references which aren't overwhelming. If you can spend the money on it, it is certainly a great addition to your library. I've recommended it to everyone.",36
Andrei,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,That which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger... it's just a matter of how you choose to see things.,"One of the best self help books I've ever read... written in the 60's by a plastic surgeon to help those still disfigured after reconstructive surgery get on with life, it will give you skills to accept and be at peace with almost anything life will ever dump on you. Once you read this you will realize how many recent best sellers just regurgitate knowledge and wisdom that was already available 50 years to centuries ago, now for the sake of making a buck.

This was recommended to me back in 1976 when I was 19, has made all the difference in the world, has also made a profound difference to everyone I have ever suggested this to and helped through crisis (and still do now, 2016.) When everyone is running around with their heads cut off you'll be the calm one wondering what the fuss is all about... able to maintain perspective and focused on what's important and needs to be done personally and professionally when either or both worlds seem to be falling in on you... I've more than survived brain damage (more than once) , divorce, career ending disability, cancer, premature death of those closest to me.. things I never expected... and can say that which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger if you happen to have the right set of coping skills in your bag of tricks. When people marvel how I just keep on going and wonder how I do it.... and I say... read this book... Every moment you are alive is a gift, that's why its called the present. be happy, be well... make the most of what you do have.",11
Brian Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Funny name. Great book!," “Creative striving for a goal that is important to you as a result of your own deep felt needs, aspirations and talents (and not the symbols which the ‘Joneses’ expect you to display) brings happiness as well as success because you will be functioning as you were meant to function. Man is by nature a goal-striving being. And because man is ‘built that way’ he is not happy unless he is functioning the way he was made to function—as a goal-striver. Thus true success and true happiness not only go together but each enhances the other.”

“Every human being has been literally ‘engineered for success’ by his Creator. Every human being has access to a power greater than himself.”

~ Maxwell Maltz from Psycho-Cybernetics

Psycho-Cybernetics. Funny name.

Great book! Maxwell Maltz was a world-renowned plastic surgeon who discovered that, while some people’s lives changed dramatically after he altered their appearance through plastic surgery, some people’s lives *didn’t*. He deduced that the primary factor that differentiated these groups was their self-image—not what they saw in the mirror but the images they had of themselves in their MINDS. Cool stuff.

He spent the second half of his career merging this self-image psychology with the then-popular science of “cybernetics”—which studies how things like guided missiles or “servo-mechanisms” hit their targets through a clear goal and constant adjustment of their course.

Here are some of the Big Ideas:

1. Cybernetics - Servo-mechanisms & you.
2. The Success Instinct - We’ve all got it!
3. Imagination - The first key.
4. Dehypnotize Yourself! - Starting now. :)
5. Rational Thought - How to use it.

Here’s to getting our Psycho-Cybernetic on as we set inspired goals, imagine our ideals, take action as we correct inevitable mistakes and practice FEELING our success. :)

Elias,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,"Self Image, the true success book","I have had many obstacles throughout life. The reasons for my obstacles finally dawned upon me through the wise words of Bob Proctor, as he mentioned the self image. He recommended a book on it, by Maxwell Maltz. Anyone who wants to make a change, a true change, this book is for you. If it's losing that weight for real, or getting that confidence, or daring to do amazing & out of the comfort zone things, then as mentioned THIS IS FOR YOU!

This book has already started to help me immensely turn my brain and thoughts into an asset instead of it being a battlefield of negative thoughts and having the self image of myself as being unworthy and not believing in myself.

I remember reading reviews for this book only 2 months ago and trying to convince myself not to take the plunge despite all of the people saying this book changed their life.

Well...it was one of the best decisions I have made. And i confidently know I will use the practices in this book for the rest of my life to be a happy, confident, and strong goal-attacking person. Dr. Maltz's guidance is already starting to ring in my head almost daily.

I value the mental benefits of this book in the thousands honestly.

WWF,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Salesmen and sports,"This Dan Kennedy revision of Maxwell Maltz's original Pscyho-cybernetics is in my opinion so geared towards salesmen and sports that if you're not a salesman, athlete, sports fan or an avid golfer, the text can be hard to get through. Sadly, Maltz's original version of Psycho-cybernetics is not offered as a Kindle book, which is why I bought this one.
Maltz's original, which I read as a teenager in the 70s, also featured athletes and salespeople, but Maltz was more inclusive in his approach. This new version should be entitled something like ""Psycho-cybernetics for Salesmen and Sports."" Salesmen and sports are great and important, but potential readers should at least be given some indication that Kennedy has taken Maltz's book so heavily in that direction so that they can decide whether or not it's really for them.",13
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Top 10 of all time.,"This is one of those few books that put forth a new idea that has not only stood the test of time but has been woven into the fabric of the entire self development industry. It's up there with ""Think and Grow Rich"" and "" How to win friends and influence people"".

It starts slow and after 2 or 3 chapters I was beginning to question the purchase. ""There is nothing to DO"" I thought. Then after it got going I felt there was TOO MUCH to do. Lots of excersises.

Of course, like so many things, the crux is in the application. Will you use it?

I think the thing I liked best is that you can really hear Dr Maltzs' passion for humanity and sincere desire to help. He seems like a wonderful man.

Also that he isn't in the pie-in-the-sky ""anyone can do anything"" camp. He teaches us to be truthful about our actual limitations, which do have limits, but are far above what most people do or even aspire to.

I put this on a short Must Read list of a handful of classics and consider it a must for anyone pursuing their full potential.

a_man,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Unlock your personality,"I stumbled upon this book by accident, having read a profound article that mentioned this book as one of its sources. I bough this book for less than 10 dollars and I must say, this is one of the best investments I have ever made. Easy to read, this book's ideas MAKE SENSE and are profound. I'd like to save my biggest reviews for one chapter only: Unlock your personality. I read this chapter at time when I was depressed, because I didn't get along with people too well. I was reserved, shy and was a social dud. My entire college years, I've been a social dud. My social life sucked. It sucked because I didn't know how to get along with people - I was irritable with people and might have appeared mean to many. The chapter: Unlock your personality might have changed my life. To follow the chapter and its advices precisely requires faith in yourself. A great leap indeed. Don't think, says the late Dr. Maltz -and act. Thinking only complicates things further. Don't think, don't over analyze yourself and just BE. It might as well be a magic bullet. It was for me, I think. Read that chapter over, and over, and over and it will eventually click. Be yourself is the message - and don't think. In social situations, don't think - and just be. Just be. Read the chapter, and you will understand what I mean. ;)",14

As I told the hundreds of individuals to whom I referred this book.....THIS IS A BOOK TO EXPERIENCE, NOT JUST READ!

Guillermo Velez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Worth the try for the cost,"Facts: It rook me months to do a decent job to relax and use the techniques described in the book. More than one reading and reading into details were necessary for me to grasp the right way to visualize what I wanted. The essentials of the book probably could me summarized in one chapter but the book includes a lot of examples, typical of this type of books. I did not achieve much the first couple of months on my first goal of reach my ideal weight. Then, my wife got me into a weight loss program and now I am well on my way to reach my goal. I keep doing the relaxation and visualization of reaching my ideal weight.

Opinion: I seek for a way to ""program"" the subconscious for a long time and this is the closest thing I have found. I started with a goal and the right tool just came along and I do not believe in coincidences. The weight loss program is making me loss weight. The techniques described in the book makes me follow the program with a very high level of discipline. The desire to reach my target weight is so high that I am able to sort almost all challenges I face to deviate from the weight loss program. I think that for the cost of the book is worth the try if you believe that you are a person of habit, that you behavior is ruled by your subconscious and you need to program that subconscious mind to change your behavior and achieve your goal",1

enya1978,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,A Book Ahead of its Time (and Ours),"This is the only book you need to read to be happy. I want to thank Mr. Maltz for this book, and express my regret that I did not find it when I was like, 12.

I knew it was a good book the minute I read ""You are not inferior. You are not superior. You are YOU"". I knew it was a good book when I read about how Maltz dismisses obtaining positive self image through ""willpower"". How many of you have heard well-meaning friends and coworkers say ""think positive"" about something that troubles you? How many of you have wondered why this well-meaning advice seldom helps? Maltz hits the nail on the head when he tells, and illustrates, why willpower and forcing positive thoughts into your head does not work. AND....he specifically tells you how to change your thought process so the positive thoughts come naturally. He gives you simple (but important) exercises to help you obtain and use the concepts he teaches.

I am a firm believe that once you have a positive image, life seems to turn out better. Not only does it look better through clear (instead of mud-shaded) glasses....but your new found self image will help you get the things you want. It will give you the power to go after what you want because you finally feel worthy. Instead of brainwashings and piecemeal advice, Maltz lays a solid groundwork using pure logic as to why YOU are worthy, and how you can convince yourself of this fact. He even gives concrete visuals to aid his lessons (healing emotional scars, much like facial scars). Emotional facelift.

This man is a genius. Do yourself a huge favor, buy this book and read it. Then read it again.",5

The sooner in life you can get these perspectives, the better for you and your loved ones. The theme in each chapter tends to develop somewhat slowly. Maltz tends to gather various points, from many different authors and sources, and takes some pages so that they coalesce into very significant and meaningful approaches to life that have immense practical value. And this is a workbook, meant to be used as a guide for your own personal work, which we all need to do very much of. Just reading it quickly through and moving on to the next book would be a huge waste.

I personally found much of the material to be ... not dense ... but dry. I hate to say that because Maltz is clearly such an intelligent man with an important message and helpful advice. But, it is true, in my opinion.

After several moves, it was lost. I recently repurchased it due to it's past impact on my thinking. A primary point that the late Dr. Maltz emphasized was his observation that plastic surgery had unexpected results with different people. For some, a minor correction caused a major personality change for the better. For others, even where the cosmetic change was more pronounced, the person's personality changed little, if at all. He attributed this to the person's innner / self image. Another key point was the power of visualization, that, if vivid / realistic enough, can have the same effect on the brain as if actually seeing / doing, a point now used regularly in sports training, et al. Both these points and others helped me immensely through my teen years and into early adulthood to break out of my ""shell"", and minimize the tendency to prejudge outcomes or approach change / the unknown negatively.

The original Psycho-Cybernetics is likely the best personal development book ever written. Used by the Lombardi era Green Bay Packers in their championship run. Used by many professional athletes and used by business people who earn over a million dollars a year. Has changed my life the most out of any personal development book I have read.

Shantel Ruiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Straight Shooter,"In an effort to understand why I have a strong tendency to ""doubt"" myself in many situations where I rationally know I excel, I bought this book and read it cover to cover.
I found the author Dr. Maltz to be incredibly insightful and the no nonsense way he delivered the information was rather refreshing. I've read my fair share of ""self help"" books and I can honestly
say that most of them carry on a lot about psychological mumbo jumbo, but NOT this one! Dr Maltz is a serious straight shooter and he really just says it like it is. I found many of the ideas he presented to cause ""ah ha"" moments inside me and the information is also very relevant, even in todays world which at first I thought might be an issue since this book was written many years ago. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a way to better understand their self-image and in essence make it better.
By far my favorite part of the book is the idea he delivers that we don't need to dredge up our past and relive it and ""figure it out"" in order to get over it. He just basically says, forget it, and move on! I LOVED THAT!! It makes me feel free from past baggage that I thought may have been holding me back. Really a great book!
If i had to say something negative, it would be that the font was kind of small ;)",3

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Best book for self development I've found,"I have been studying psychology for the past 3 years at least, and have delved into topics such as NLP, hypnosis, destructive patterns etc. I have studied each of these topics and more in great depth and detail, and have to say that this book is by far the most treasured possession I own. This book is what I consider to be the answer, the key to all of self development. If you want to accomplish ANYTHING and you are not, there is a reason for it, and this book can help you. If you will read it, and then re-read it, and then re-read it, until you begin to fully understand and comprehend the principles and concepts presented, it will change your life....dramatically.

The book's whole premise is that we all behave not according to how things actually are, but how we perceive them to be. As a result of this, our beliefs can be very skewed, and thus our behavior will be as well. It is the task of this book to teach and instruct the reader in how to recognize irrational beliefs, use rational conscious thought to determine what they want to believe instead, and then use principles such as ""theater in the mind"" and ""acting as if"" to create a new reality experienced by your mind, which will program your self image, and thus create a new objective reality around you.

My personal opinion is that this book contains the key, the solution to any problem you are currently having, which you want to change but don't know how to, or are unsure of where to start. I highly recommend it.",8
Gadgeteer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,"Written decades ago, but still pertinent","Dr. Maltz, originally a face surgeon, came to recognize in his patients a need for a positive self image, which need transcended the physical characteristics that patients wanted improved.

He compares the methodology of achieving a desired improvement in one's self image with that used in the design of modern physical automatic control systems (he uses the term ""Cybernetics"" to describe the servomechanism systems of his day, such as those used in military fire control systems).

The concept is imaginative, and Dr. Maltz uses most of his book to describe various methods for helping change one's self image to the one that is desired, presumably by using negative feedback control to minimize the difference between one's current self image and one's desired self image, similar in concept to how military fire control systems operate.

While the basic ideas presented by Dr. Maltz are intriguing the human brain is so much more complex than the design of a military fire control system that the basic concepts presented must be taken with this important limitation in mind.

The fact that book is still in print after many decades and has sold many millions of copies, however, is a tribute to some validity of Dr. Maltz's basic concepts.",3

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Great book,"I purchased the updated version of this book first (edited by Dan Kennedy), and then bought this one. I would definitely recommend this one, because although Dan Kennedy means well, the updated version just has too much stuff in it, and it's easy to lose sight of the forest for all the trees, so to speak. This book has all the nuts and bolts of psycho cybernetics in it, and you won't need another one if you really study and read it.
If you're really trying to change your life, or a certain habit, or any other kind of personal change, this is the book for you. It's the science of how the mind works - and it's more fundamental than anything by Tony Robbins, The Secret, Hypnosis, and NLP. This book is extravagant and foundational for personal change and I'd recommend it with the highest level I possibly could for everyone. I've bought 5 extra copies, and gave them away to friends and family; that's how impressed I am with it.",9

Reggie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Nothing psycho about ths book,"Not for the novice reader. Psycho-Cybernetics: A new technique for using your subconscious power should not be read in one sitting. You should take time to absorb and personally relate to every page. Do not expect to accept or even understand the subconsciously presented concepts of the human mind.

Sharon Delarose,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Maltz exposes the true power of the mind,"Everything is possible if you believe... the power of the mind is incredible. Amaze yourself. We are capable of so much more than we are taught to believe. If only they taught this in school. This is what we should be teaching our kids. Psychocybernetics doesn't teach you what to think, but HOW to think in such a way that your entire life will be transformed. Improve yourself in any area, sports, your job, your love life, simply by readjusting your approach to the world. Maxwell Maltz exposes the secrets of how powerful our thoughts are. And he offers scientific proof to back it up. Maxwell Maltz tells it better than most anybody else I've read.

I first encountered this book back in the early 80's. I didn't know it then but my life was being transformed into something pretty amazing and this was one of the books that helped me change the entire course of my life. Many books passed thru my hands but this was a keeper. I sent my sister a copy nearly 20 years later in the hopes that she could restart her life in a happier new direction.",2

Phil Saparov,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Life-changing read,"I used the advice presented in this book to bring about major change with great results at least twice.
First, when I sprained my knee and tore my ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament), I used the concept of striving towards a goal and thinking of my physical body as a servo-mechanism to heal myself. Where I got the method of healing is a whole 'nother story. But the concept of driving yourself towards an image of Health instead of trying to get away from disease really helped.

It no longer mattered what exactly was wrong with my knee - whether it was a partial or complete tear, or whether one or two menisci had been torn, and to which degree. The idea was to focus on the solution instead of the problem. It took me about 3 months to get back to living a normal life, where I could dance, run, and even do heavy squats again.

The second time I used this concept was when I had completely exhausted my system as a result of emotionally and physically draining work that I had been doing for a long time and for too many hours per week. At some point, all of a sudden, I got a whole host of physical and emotional problems, the worst of which was a pretty severe case of depression.

I changed my job, and went in for different therapies, some of which helped to a degree. But I attribute most of the success, especially in the emotional part, to Psychocybernetics. You see, different therapists analyzed my condition and tried to heal each of the causes that might have had an ill effect on me. This made me focus too much on the causes, which were the problem, instead of focusing on the solution.

Once again, I armed myself with Psychocybernetics and went to work. It took me about 3-4 months to feel almost 100% again. But the most important thing that I remember was that as soon I started to focus on the image of health and think about all the things I would do as soon as I was better, that's when my healing really took off.

Buy it. Use it.
Best,

Phil Saparov",13

I've only been using this method a couple of months, but it is nicer. Some hypnotists recommended to me that I get an older edition of this book, one that has not been messed with by any other additional authors, so I got this one.

Although at first I was quite skeptical because of the age of the book (I though ""Would there be something new for me, would the ideas be still valid?""), after first several pages doubts dissolved and I was entirely caught.

I believe all the reviews have said already enough, so I'll keep my review short. This book has all that I want from it:
- Down-to-earth style without exaggerations. Yet very strong and moving content, explaining how human brain works, what brings us happiness/more life, and how to achieve it.
- Positive :o). Gives reader so much energy into his life.
- No easy-read. Should be read definitely more times than once.

Simply put, this is a must read in the area of self-help/psychology books.

Some of favorite quotes:

""The self-image is changed, for better or worse, not by intellect alone, nor by intellectual knowledge alone, but by ""experiencing."" Wittingly or unwittingly you developed your self-image by your creative experiencing in the past. You can change it by the same method. "" (page x)
""One of the most pleasant thoughts to any human being is the thought that he is needed, that he is important enough to help and add to the happiness of some other human being."" (page 97)

""Since man is a goal striving being, he is functioning naturally and normally when he is oriented toward some positive goal and striving toward some desirable goal. Happiness is a symptom of normal, natural functioning and when man is functioning as a goal-striver, he tends to feel fairly happy, regardless of circumstances."" (page 101)

""Our habits are not accidental, or happenstance. We have them because they fit us. They are consistent with our self-image and our entire personality pattern. When we consciously and deliberately develop new and better habits, our self-image tends to outgrow the old habits and grow into the new pattern. "" (page 108)

""To give the other person credit for being sincere, if mistaken, rather than willful and malicious, can do much to smooth out human relations and bring about better understanding between people. Ask yourself, ""How does this appear--to him?"" ""How does he interpret this situation?"" ""How does he feel about it?"" Try to understand why he might ""act the way he does."""" (page 115)

""Man maintains his balance, poise, and sense of security only as he is moving forward--or seeking. When you think of yourself as having attained the goal, you become static, and you lose the security and equilibrium you had when you were moving towards something. The man who is convinced that he is ""good"" in the absolute sense, not only has no incentive to do better, but he feels insecure because he must defend the sham and pretense."" (page 137)

""Regardless of your feelings, force yourself to mix and mingle with other people. After the first cold plunge, you will find yourself warming up and enjoying it if you persist. Develop some social skill that will add to the happiness of other people: dancing, bridge, playing the piano, tennis, conversation. It is an old psychological axiom that constant exposure to the object of fear immunizes against the fear. As the lonely person continues to force himself into social relations with other human beings--not in a passive way, but as an active contributor--he will gradually find that most people are friendly, and that he is accepted. His shyness and timidity begin to disappear. He feels more comfortable in the presence of other people and with himself. The experience of their acceptance of him enables him to accept himself."" (page 139)

""If responding and reacting to negative feedback does not take us further down the road to our own goal--or serve our ends, then there is no need to respond at all. And, if response of any kind gets us off course, or works against us--then no response is the appropriate response."" (page 199)

""If life adapts itself in so many varied forms to act as a means toward an end, is it not reasonable to assume that if we place ourselves in the sort of goal-situation where more life is needed, that we will receive more life?"" (page 261)",7

Just put your doubts aside and BUY THIS BOOK today.
Right now while you are thinking about it. The sooner you get it, the sooner you will benefit from its simple effective techniques.

It costs [very little money] and if applied even a little bit, it is likely to change your life. How many other things that cost [this little] can you say that about.
The original edition DID change MY life about 10 years ago and I know at least 5 other people who point to this book (and another classic-Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill) as major keys to their personal philosophy and success in life.
This revised edition is even better than the original due to the care put into it by Dan Kennedy, who is keeping Dr. Maltz's work alive for the present generation with this timely update.
I liked it so much I have bought 5 more copies for some great business associates as gifts.

Put the techniques that have made many ordinary people appear to be extraordinary to work for you. You don't have to work harder, you just need to apply these amazing principals to your current methods and your will be so much more effective.
I also highly recommended ""Zero Resistance Selling"" for sales persons as a companion to this book which specializes the same techniques to Sales careers.",9

J. K. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,This book is different`,"It's so easy to see how this book has sold over 30,000,000 copies. I can honestly say that I think this book has ended my search for the ""perfect"" self-help book.
After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to buy this book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I've had the book for one week now and I am already seeing results.
About 3 years ago I entered into the world of sales and all of a sudden I became painfully aware of my self-image or my self-esteem as others call it. I became very self-conscious and started down a slippery slope into the world of negative thinking and emotions that weren't helping me at all.
So I did what any person would do who wants to overcome their limiting beliefs and learn how to overcome negative thinking and I started buying self-help litereature. my library is chocked full of books from all the greats. Well I learned something from all the books that I read, but I just felt there was always something missing. I didn't feel like I had the information that I needed to really turn it all around. I tried ""Affirmations"" etc. with marginal results.
Then I found this book. Maxwell talks about how we act, feel and perform is in direct relation to how we imagine ourselves to be. You may need to read that last sentence again because it's what helped me to start putting it all together. He then gives techniques for changing your self-image and overcoming your negative thinking that really works.
I'm very grateful to Maxwell for writing this book. He really put his heart into it and made a masterpiece!
Please don't make the mistake of not buying this book. It could well be the best money you ever spent! God Bless!",21

I bought the new psycho-cybernetics and am greatly disappointed with it. It tries to be too much, almost like they've tried to add several unrelated ""books"" of unrelated info to psycho-cybernetics. There are stories and additional paragraphs of information that you're not quite sure what to do with and it clouds the original ideas. Anyone can make a book longer with lots of extra info but a nicely summarized and boiled down series of thoughts is difficult to do so get the original because that's what it is; I just ordered the original again and will leave this ""updated"" copy in the hotel I'm staying in right now.",22

LindaT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,A Good Thing Made Even Better,"I heard about the first PSYCHO CYBERNETICS book in the 60's (yes, I am over 21 years old) and when I read it I thought it was wonderful. In fact, I thought that if I only would be able to have one self-help book, it would be this one.
THE NEW PSYCHO CYBERNETICS has taken a good book and made it even better. The masterful editing and adapting by Dan Kennedy is great. It still is done in the voice of the original author, Dr. Maxwell Maltz, but it has up to date examples of people most of us know from this time in history, yet it still includes the examples Dr. Maltz wrote about in his original book.
The theme hasn't changed -- Dr. Maltz claimed that the human mind has a ""servo-mechanism"" which can help us accomplish what we desire, but we must let it do its work once the desire is ""fed into"" the mind. He drew upon his knowledge of the then fledgling work of computers. And now in the 21st century, computers have advanced in an unbelievable manner, and yet the principle behind which they work is still the same; the goal-striving mechanism which works towards its teleological end by negative feedback, correction, and positive feedback.
I have other self help books, but for me, this one is the basis on which all the others are carried out.
I can't recommend it highly enough.",23

I think that there is something for everyone in this book and I have started to buy the book for friends and family members. I highly recommend this book to anyone.

N/A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,"Solid, Disciplined ""Self-Improvement"" Book","Unlike many other New Age type books which talks about self-elevating, self-magnificating, self-actualising, self-meditative and all that crap, this book gives some good solid ground rules on creating a strong positive mindset that will help one better oneself with practice.
This book is a modern treatment of Maltz's original book and has made it even more palatable and applicable in daily life. The exercises are simple, straightforward and effective. One just needs to practice.
You're not reading this book to be enlightened to salvation or something (which you can read the Holy Bible for!) but rather, this book prepares your mind to set goals in the daily routine of life. It is about setting goals, and consciously thinking how you could achieve them, letting your subconscious autopilot ""servo-mechanism"" help you on the way there through deliberate practical exercises. This book is even more readable than the original.
Very readable, very practical, and no ""mind power"" mystical nonsense. Just straight cut practical tips to sharpen the mind.",12
Ramon Acosta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,The first and foremost,"Without a doubt, Dr. Maltz' classic is still on top of the heap of self-help books, tapes and seminars available. Everything that was relevant in late 1950 and early 1960 is still relevant today. Unless humans fundamentally change the way the brain operates, this book will be a classic text on the process of communicating with and reprogramming the inner self.

There's only one downside about this book. If you don't try the mental techniques, nothing will change. You might manufacture a new line of thinking after absorbing the material, but if you don't practice and apply it on a near daily basis, then you've merely read one of the greatest psychology texts of all time. A bit of mental elbow grease will instead allow you to experience this book and the profound change you and your loved ones can all potentially benefit from.",7

Rubin Wald,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Great Update of a Classic!,"Dan Kennedy has done a brilliant job of giving Dr. Maltz's classic text a contemporary feel while remaining true to the original version.
I still have my 1974 Pocket Book edition of Psycho-Cybernetics and its ideas and insights helped me a lot in understanding life and success and how I could control my own destiny.
This updated version is even better! I especially liked the PRESCRIPTION and MENTAL TRAINING EXERCISE boxes that Mr. Kennedy has strategically placed throughout the book. They contain very clear suggestions and practical exercises for living an abundant and fulfilling life. For example, he prescribes keeping a ""success diary"" as a tool for building a stronger self-image. And on page 201, there is an powerful exercise for developing the all important habit of forgiveness.
One of the insights Dr. Maltz gave me that helped clarify my own life journey was his understanding that our unconscious minds cannot distinguish between a real experience and the same experience vividly imagined. Years later I found confirmation for this idea in Quantum Physics.
Nobel Prize winning Physicist Niels Bohr's Complementarity Principle shows us that the mental aspect of an imagined experience is complementary to its physical aspect. Both are equally 'real'. No wonder imagination and visualization are such valuable skills to master for anyone who wants to transform their dreams into physcial reality.
I wonder if Dr. Maltz and Dr. Bohr ever had a conversation!
Dan Kennedy has done a tremendous favor for anyone who wants knowledge and practical applications for being more successful. I applaud his efforts.",38

Ken Nuehs,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Unlocked My Success Mechanism,"As of last night, I finished the most amazing book called Psycho Cybernetics, by Maxwell Maltz. I am proud to say this is the first book that I have completed all the way through in over a year. I bought this book back in 2009 when I was fighting the boredom in Iraq and remember only reading a few chapters. After I learned that it was a recommended reading by some of the leaders in Empower Network, I decided to dust it off and see how the top earners have used this book to unlock their success mechanisms and start living a more fulfilling life.

And boy, I'm glad I did!

This powerful book has provided so much value to my life. I now know the power of imagination and have started to imagine successful outcomes when going through a sales presentation, public speaking presentations, and any areas of my life that I'm not completely comfortable and confident in.

And let me tell you the concepts in Psycho Cybernetics works!

I've had my best month in personal training sales at the gym with over $3,000 in sales in just the first 3 weeks. One sale worth $1,950. My previous best was $1,800 for the full month.

There are parts that give clarity to what most parents, or coaches don't tell you that well.

The advice on happiness and forgiveness are something of a new-age, but conventional, as well.
I understood every part of it, and it is a book I look back into.

1) After reading, I took a different approach to my world
2) Before reading, I hadn't known some of the topics, and their expenditure
3) While reading, I was hooked. I could keep going for its lessons

This new edition is, amazingly enough, even better than the original. It's clearer, easier to follow, and even more compelling. I'll always be grateful to the person who recommended this to me when I was 20 years old. Twenty two years later, I'm living a life most people only dream of.

A User,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Better Than the Original; Max Would Have Been Proud,"Greetings:
Join us at the Psycho-Cybernetics discussion group on [...]
To date, I have bought three hardcover editions of the New Psycho-Cybernetics (NPC): one I gave to a friend, one I take with me to read during the day, and one I keep in my home office to work with on those days when I work at home. I have found it a significant improvement upon the original. (I have used up three paperback versions of the original over the last 10 years.)
I remember when I first read the original version of PC, in around 1990. I thought it was somewhat hokey. I used to be an engineer, and I thought it somewhat strange to try to apply feedback control systems theory to people. We are not machines, after all.
The strange thing, though, was that the system worked for me. Still, I was somewhat embarrassed about the whole thing, so I sort of kept my dabbling to myself.
Then, in the mid-late nineties, I read Fritjof Capra's book, The Web of Life. In that book, Capra talks a lot about systems theory, and he also goes into the history of the original cybernetics group (not Psycho cybernetics, but rather a group of mathematicians, psychologists, biologists, and physicists who collaborated in WWII to create anti-aircraft guns that could effectively track and destroy enemy aircraft). In his discussion, Capra explains that the original cybernetics group's goal was to try to make machines that could do what people and animals do naturally and easily, without conscious thought. They tried to do this, in part, by observing the actions of animals and people. Based on such observation, the group devised the early foundation of what became our modern science of systems control as used in almost every modern electrical/mechanical system.
What Maltz tried to do was take a bit of the science and art of systems control and apply it back to people, in an attempt to improve their functioning. I think one of the original cyberneticists, Norbert Weiner, also tried to do this in his book, The Human Use of Human Beings, but I could be wrong.
Anyway, because Psycho-Cybernetics is based on systems theory, in contrast to other types of ""self help"" or positive thinking books, it recognizes that a person trying to achieve her goals is going to fail, and miss what she is pursuing, probably many times on her way to her destination. Rather than candy coating this fact and suggesting ""positive thinking,"" PC suggests feedback control system oriented techniques to use, deal with, and not be completely stymied by such failures.
It also provides techniques to help one deal with ""drama queen"" co-workers and supervisors who seem to go out of their way to provide damaging negative feedback (e.g., ignoring negative feedback in ch. 11, ""How to Unlock Your Real Personality""), or retarding how fast responds to negative feed back (e.g., delaying the response, as in ch. 12 ""Do It Yourself Tranquilizers that Bring Peace of Mind."").

Now, on to the new version of PC: my own opinion is that it is better than the original. Dan follows the original structure of the PC book, and much of the text is in common. However, Dan has buttressed that text with additional examples taken from the many hours of recordings and reams of Maltz' notes that Dan owns. In addition, Dan also provides many practical examples of the successful application of PC techniques that have arisen since the original version of the book was published in 1960.
Try NPC. If, like me, you have areas in your life where you would like to do better, I think you will find it useful.",48

It's apparent that this book was written before drugs were prevelant in our society because there's no outlandish statements, no grey area, and it's actually down to earth and makes sense.

Susil Manchanayaka,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Understand Yourself,"I bought this book and read it. It is interesting for many reasons. I am a lover of books and I am married to books (metaphorically). Why I say that this book is interesting is that it is life changing. The few dollars I spent on this book is worth and I learnt a lot by reading this book. The chapters are shorter and easy to grasp. Some ideas may be unfamiliar to a novice reader but if you are an experienced and an avid reader, you can get at the gist of the book.

Many people have complexes (psychological) and they struggle to come out of the shell they live in. This book helps you to see the world as it is and you can transform your life with ideas from the book. The ideas in the book are worth remembering and practicing. If you are into understanding the nature of human mentality, behavior and why people do certain things but why they are afraid of doing certain things is interesting. In our lives we undergo numerous pains and we sometimes become depressed and helpless. This book helps anyone to see the world as it is.

The writer is an experienced professional in his field and particularly this book helps one to be motivated, enthusiastic in anything she does and develop confidence. He is a leading scholar and a much respected counselor. I read about his biography on the net and I was very impressed. He is an authority on his subject. I can say that this book is a booster - it boosts your performance. It is light reading.

Maltz takes the reader into an unexplored area of human mentality, how to overcome fears, the basis of fear and personal development. He helps the reader overcome fears. He argues that most of the fears we have are all baseless and unscientific. Fears come out of ignorance. Fears come out of wrong perceptions we have. Fears come out of not being exposed to the world we live in. That is what he says.

The book is pocket sized and you can carry it when you travel. It is like a handbook on personal development. If you have any interest in mentoring, counseling, public speaking or teaching, this is the next book you may consider reading.

I personally like the ideas in the book. The time you may spend will be worth the trouble you take to read this book. The chapters in it are short and run into a couple of pages and at a single sitting you can read a chapter. Make this book a partner in your life. It is worth buying and keeping in your private library. In life one may experience ups and downs. Tribulations in life are part of human existence on this planet. We seek advice from others, counselors, teachers or if you belong to a profession of respect - mentors. This book is a companion mentor. If you are in need of some expert advice, consult this book. Discuss what is in it. It will pay rich dividends.

The final verdict on the book is that it is a book of interesting ideas for us to be human. It is a book that teaches us how to face life. It is a book that teaches us live happily. It is a book that teaches us how to help others in need. My friends, read it. You will soon see a dramatic transformation in your life. It is life changing and mind changing. The contents of the book are to be digested (metaphorically). The ideas in the book by Maltz (the writer) will enlighten you all.

N/A,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,bizzare...,"My big problem with this book is the material that Dan Kennedy added. While it provides useful background and some updated examples, Kennedy weaves it in seemlessly into the old material. What you get is confusion. The first person of Kennedy is mixed in with the first person of Maltz, without being differentiated in any way! So in the same section, you have someone speaking of ""my patients"" in the '40's or '50's, and then the same voice speaking of ""my experiences"" with a Kevin Costner movie or a Michael Jordan anecdote. There is no change in typeface, or paragraph structure to indicate that different people are writing, one long-dead, the other alive and ""editing"" this book. Why didn't Kennedy's editor make him place his commentary separately?
This was enough to spoil most of the usefulness of this edition for me. I suggest noting the boxed exercises that Kennedy includes, which are useful, and then reading the original of the book.",53

Jon Torodash,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,A pioneer in the field still standing strong,"I don't make it a habit to read self-help books, but the off-color fitness guru Matt Furey has made a killing on selling a program based off of Maltz's work, and most other ""motivational speakers"" usually bend a knee in respect to Maltz as a forerunner. So I picked up a cheap used copy and read it cover to cover. The only question I have left is why anyone would bother with any of the other crap. This book effectively condenses the entirety of the self-help field. As far as I can tell, this is as good as it gets by the standards of the genre, is enjoyably accessible to a general audience, and has weathered time's attack on its relevance stunningly well.

Firstly, Maltz had the raw clinical experience necessary to write this kind of book. As a crackerjack plastic surgeon he saw immediately and firsthand the life-changing or life-stalling power of self-image at work in the faces of his patients. (And anyone who scoffs at unorthodox contributors to a research field ought to know that Albert Einstein was working for the Swiss patent office when he submitted the Theory of Special Relativity.) Yet Maltz also admits where exactly the limits of his knowledge lie rather than try to convince the reader of his omniscience.

Secondly, Maltz was receptive to many fundamental tenets of psychology and philosophy and works them into Psycho Cybernetics clearly and without contradiction. Nor does he try to repackage ancient metaphysical hokum with inane and feeble examples.

Thirdly, there are no workshops, special reports, live phone help, or products to buy. (Though I cannot speak for the organization that has cropped up around Maltz's name.) All pretense and exaggeration for marketing purposes seem absent from his book.

Maltz was definitive and unequivocal in his ideas, quick to set a standard and stick to it. He took seriously some very fundamental issues of life and makes clear statements. This book rises high above the haphazard pop philosophy/ethics smeared all over mass media which are either shallow and weak or imperiously stupid. Maltz simply faced the truth of his own convictions. Psycho Cybernetics by no means outlines life management skills as an exact science, but its frank suggestions are intellectually compelling. Overall, the book is worthwhile because Maltz' honest and non-condescending style at least earns your respect, if not your belief.",467

Each chapter seemed to ramble on and on. It is a lengthy book and it seems like a lot of the chapter content was redundant saying the same thing over. The book discusses one's self image, happiness, success and how to evaluate it in life.

The author has a section about SUCCESS (sense of direction, understanding, courage, charity, esteem, self confidence and self acceptance). However each of these bullet points were very basic principles. Same applies to his chapter on FAILURE (frustration, aggressiveness, insecurity, lonliness, uncertainty, resentment and emptiness). Again, very basic material.

For me the last third of the book was more boring than the other two-thirds. It was a hard book to finish being so uninteresting. I can't recommend this book.",6

Christian Rosenkreutz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Technique for Using Your Subconscious Power,Outdated psuedo-science,"I consider myself to be pretty open-minded, especially in regards to the potentials of the human mind, but this book actually reads like a laundry list of little ""fixes"" to do with your life, and reads more like a precursor to infomercial formats than to gaining any kind of insight whatsoever.

The author declares right away that he is not a psychologist, but considers himself qualified (and believe me, I am not a fan of the word ""qualified"" by any means) and continues to compare himself to Einstein, Madam Curie, Wright Brothers (should I have to mention all of their minds actually created advances that changes the entire world without question?) all in the preface, before you even get to the table of contents, which I will briefly list a few entries:

""your key to a better life""

""the success mechanism within you""

""first key to success mechanism""

""dehypnotize yourself""

""let your success mechanism work for you""

""habit of happiness""

""success-type personality""

""failure mechanism""

""how to give yourself an emotional facelift""

""do-it-yourself tranquilizers that bring peace of mind""

I won't go any further, although there are more. My problem is that not only is this self-proclaimed ""scientist/psychologist"" coining new terms, he does it in a very QVC way. I am all for understanding the programming we submit ourselves to, and ways to understand the mind, and patterns of thought, however this book is a waste of time, only for the mindless reader that in fact turns off their brain to read this book (the author actually asks you to do that while reading, its in one of the first chapters, right after he tries to convince the reader that ""telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition have been established by scientific laboratory experiments."" That is the actual sentence from page 24. I would be delighted by nothing more than to get ahold of these ""scientific laboratory experiments"" data records to see this for myself.

The rest is filled with case studies that have bee refuted, ideas that are no longer valid and lots, and lots of God talk. When the author runs up against the wall of lack of evidence he just simply states ""and this is where science runs out so we need to turn to religion"". Instead of posing questions about what needs to come and pondering on the advancements that will be achieved by science he just simply states ""God made you this way now be happy with it."" You wouldn't consult a 2,000 year old medical journal for proper surgical procedures, so why would you try to apply the workings of 2,000 year old brains who thought the earth was flat and rain could be obtained with animal sacrifices and dances to modern brains?

Gregory A.

The authors focus on what appears to be the likely path for human evolution in the next century. Although Paul and Cox indulge in some heavy-handed treatment of contemporary social and political issues, they snipe equally at all political parties and conventional belief systems without prejudice. They really drop a bomb on religion in general - seems they have some personal ax to grind here. The authors overestimate the intellectual maturity of our species on this issue ignoring the important stabilizing affect of religion in a society recently descended from the trees. Humanity is not ready to cast off the warm blanket of religion and face the cold nausea of a morally inert universe. Overall, an excellent and thought-provoking text that should stimulate a lot of dialog in the future.",15

What I can't figure out is why the Churchlands were asked to write a preface to the book, I wish they had at least done their homework or just checked their facts; mistaking William Church (a relative unknown in spite of a patent on typesetting machine dating back to early 1800's) for Alonzo Church, a towering figure in the foundations of computing is plain unacceptable.

While PC has many stories to flesh out its point so they penetrate deep into your heart, this book builds upon that and offers the most succinct information (and motivation) possible. The Question and Answer section in each chapter is an amazing resource!

Regardless of the size or mission, every organization will benefit from his clear definitions of accountability and responsibility.

Robert David STEELE Vivas,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Holistic Darwinism: Synergy, Cybernetics, and the Bioeconomics of Evolution",Beyond 6 Stars--And a Seventh for Accessible Pricing,"I could spend a lifetime reading and re-reading this book, and each of the cited sources, and not waste the time at all. This is one of the most extraordinary works I have encountered, and while I cannot do it justice, I will summarize it. Four other books that join this one in framing my third and last stage of life:
Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge
Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny
A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility--Report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change
The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, Revised and Updated 5th Anniversary Edition: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits

Bottom line: Humanity can evolve, must evolve, and the Whole Earth, Co-Evolution concepts that Stewart Brand and others pioneered (not mentioned here), that indigenous people's everywhere have understood for centuries, are a natural path for us all. We *can* create a prosperous world at peace.

Short version of the book: Synergy is cool again, synergy and self-organization complement each other and are distinct; bioeconomics is hugely important and supports the premise that the whole is larger than the sum of the parts and that interactions and exchanges can and should be done for the whole, ""beyond selfishness,"" cybernetics rules, information is the space between, and ethics is both a form of cybernetics and a cultural adaptation that helps the whole evolve and persist.

The author earned an inter-disciplinary PhD in social and life sciences, and went on to be the director of the Institute for the Study of Complex Systems and has been active in: International Society for the Systems Sciences; International Society for Bioeconomics; Association for Politics and the Life Sciences; Epic of Evolution Society; International Society for Human Ethology; Human Behavior and Evolution Society; International Society for Endocytobiology; European Sociobiological Society, and International Association for Cybernetics.

I've never heard of any of these, but mention them to both praise the author's inter-disciplinary background, and point out that it is not all that inter-disciplinary (see the Web of Knowledge at the Phi Beta Iota Public Intelligence Blog version of this review). Four books from a world that is NOT covered by this extraordinary book:
The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for All
Conscious Evolution: Awakening Our Social Potential
Integral Consciousness and the Future of Evolution
Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming

This book is easier to read than E. O. Wilson's CONSILIENCE, and every bit as erudite. Within each chapter I absolutely marveled at the history and the homework that went into summarizing the history of the ideas developed therein.

This is such a complex and deep book I would have preferred the notes on their respective page, and chapter-specific bibliographies in addition to the consolidated one. This book needs its own web page, and would be extremely interesting as a Wiki-book with infinite branching.

QUOTE: Holistic Darwinism is not a different theory; it involves a different perspective on the evolutionary process.

QUOTE: Holistic Darwinism is distinctive in that it is concerned especially with the bioeconomics--the functional costs and benefits--of cooperative phenomena of all kinds.

I smile for two reasons: first, Tom Atlee's new book, Reflections on Evolutionary Activism, will be on Amazon shortly (is at Phi Beta Iota now); and second, having just read a book that taught me we now have neuro-economists, I marvel at how an entire fraudulent discipline is finally finding respectability by devolving back to the real world.

This book by itself is a PhD if fully exploited, which I cannot. A few high points:

+ Sociobiology favors democracy, those who says it does not are in error. I agree.

+ Recognizing inter-dependence is an ""aha"" moment (the Republican word is epiphany).

+ Genes alone don't cut it. Culture and cybernetics are integral to human consciousness and evolution and outcome.

BIG INSIGHT FOR ME: The more complex a society or superorganism becomes, the more vital it is that it develop faster, better, cheaper feedback loops with less and less corruption of signal. This is consistent with all of my reading on the collapse of complex societies, and the author covers that literature. He does not, however, mention Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems or other related books on resilience.

+ Bioeconomics first written about in 1913 (that the author can determine). Focuses on the acquisition of resources by living beings, the author concluding that humanity is a collective survival enterprise.

KEYWORDS: network theory, network dynamics, niche construction, emergence theory, evolutionary developmental systems theory, systems biology, gene-culture co-evolution theory, and many more.

+ Politics is badly formed and badly executed human cybernetics.

+ Political ecosystem is ready for Evolutionary Activism (my conclusion)

+ Richard Dawkins made a huge contribution but was a reductionist. Holistic Darwinism is a segue to neo-Darwinism and inspired by Dawkins.

+ Cooperation and complexity go together--Tom Atlee would say that competition and cooperation go together. Both Atlee and this author discuss non-zero, win-win and related strategies.

+ Prime mover theories don't stand up, convergences do.

+ In his review of the collapse literature, I keep coming back to inadequate responses, and the reality that inadequate responses are tied to corruption and the loss of integrity in feedback loops.

QUOTE: ""In short, a global superorganism will succeed only as a cooperative process in which the pooling of sovereignty on a global level is viewed as mutualistic and is not seen as the imposition of a regime that serves the interests of only one power, or one segment of the world community, namely the rich countries and multinational firms.""

+ The author speaks of a need for integrating anthropology with economics and the life sciences, in my view he does not go nearly far enough, some of us are already at Web 4.0 and thinking about how Cognitive Science on the one side (this book being part of that side) and Collective Intelligence on the other (see Collective Intelligence: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace) must inevitably integrate all information in all languages all the time, and connect all human minds to all of that information in near-real-time. I won't like to my books, they are easily found.

The author concludes that the social sciences have failed, and I quite agree.",11
Jake Keenan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Holistic Darwinism: Synergy, Cybernetics, and the Bioeconomics of Evolution",Keeps getting better,"This work states the case for the importance of synergy across biology and economics much more solidly than his prior work. It is surprising that the book has not gotten a review until now. I wish that works like this were getting more attention than the intelligent design vs. evolution debate. Corning assembles a lot of evidence to point towards the ""new evolutionary paradigm."" I cannot think of another work which marshalls so many parallel lines of research to where a new synthesis might be coming. Readable, sometimes polemical, informative, and clear. At some point, though, there is almost too much thrown into his case. Four sections packed in a lot: Synergy and evolution, Bioeconomics, Thermodynamics of life, and Evolutionary ethics. The thermodynamics section was a gem on the often confused subject of how biology meets thermodynamic theory. His idea: ""In sum, the development of novel bioenergetic technologies in the evolutionary process has had little to do with entropy or dissipative structures and much more to do with engineering--design improvements in the ability of living systems to capture and utilize available energy. It is the organized use of available energy in evolved, informed (cybernetic) structures that has been the key, as noted earlier. And the explanation for these changes lies in their economic advantages, as Lotka long ago suggested."" (p. 351)

Since me and my sister are both in Universities, my parents are both busy with their work and they are left all alone at home. They are not really tech-savvy and are still confused on the concept of google and wifi.

The features of Amazon Echo or ""Alexa"" are really high tech and I guess that's good.

Lee Gillette,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,"You've done it again, Mr. Maltz.","One of the first copies of Maxwell Maltz's book, Psycho-Cybernetics is still, to this day, on my bookshelf.

In 1961, It did much more than just put me on my quest for self-improvement. For the very first time, someone connected the mind to the body and brought home the old, simple adage ... ""Change your Mind and you change your life!""

That was Psycho-Cybernetics. That was the principle of Self Image Psychology ... proven and verified by science itself as an irresistible and powerful no nonsense psychology of happiness and fulfillment.

From there on ... for decades ... everything else that was printed in the Self Help Industry became supporting commentary for the principles in this book.

An now ... the new ""enhanced"" version of Psycho-Cybernetics just arrived. And Yesssss!!! I enjoyed this one as much as the original. If not more so!

Comparing the two, the new authors kept the voice and the insights of the original text intact, integrating only the updates needed for new generations to come to experience and cherish the joy of reading this old, new classic for the first time. And experience it, you will. You cannot do otherwise.

Indeed, it gives me great pleasure to recommend this new version of the book that's been around for over a half century. If you are not among the 35 million+ people who read the older one ... please, do yourself a favor ... get a copy now and read it!

You will find that Psycho-Cybernetics will do it to you, as it did it to us, decades ago. True to its kind, the new Enhanced version of Psycho-Cybernetics is still the only book that scientifically proves the principle of Self Image Psychology and makes it the new foundation for a new century's hope, success and the dream of a better life.

I've come across and read a lot from people like Jack Canfield, Joel Osteen, Law of Attraction - Teachings of Abraham, etc. They were all good, uplifting and helpful works in their own right, but something was missing. I was listening to a podcast and the host mentioned this book, which was something I've never heard about - ever or anywhere. I looked it up on Amazon and decided to order it. I am sure glad I did. For me, it brought all of the other ideas, concepts and practices together. Things like affirmations, burning desires, faith, action - they all are great, as long as they're operating in conjunction with the way you see yourself and want to see yourself. This book really stresses the importance of focusing on your self-image, which is something I've found many of the other works glossed over or lacked. It's a good work, laced with some biblical references which aren't overwhelming. If you can spend the money on it, it is certainly a great addition to your library.

This was recommended to me back in 1976 when I was 19, has made all the difference in the world, has also made a profound difference to everyone I have ever suggested this to and helped through crisis (and still do now, 2016.) When everyone is running around with their heads cut off you'll be the calm one wondering what the fuss is all about... able to maintain perspective and focused on what's important and needs to be done personally and professionally when either or both worlds seem to be falling in on you... I've more than survived brain damage (more than once) , divorce, career ending disability, cancer, premature death of those closest to me.. things I never expected... and can say that which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger if you happen to have the right set of coping skills in your bag of tricks. When people marvel how I just keep on going and wonder how I do it.... and I say... read this book...

Brian Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Funny name. Great book!," “Creative striving for a goal that is important to you as a result of your own deep felt needs, aspirations and talents (and not the symbols which the ‘Joneses’ expect you to display) brings happiness as well as success because you will be functioning as you were meant to function. Man is by nature a goal-striving being. And because man is ‘built that way’ he is not happy unless he is functioning the way he was made to function—as a goal-striver. Thus true success and true happiness not only go together but each enhances the other.”

“Every human being has been literally ‘engineered for success’ by his Creator. Every human being has access to a power greater than himself.”

~ Maxwell Maltz from Psycho-Cybernetics

Psycho-Cybernetics. Funny name.

Great book! Maxwell Maltz was a world-renowned plastic surgeon who discovered that, while some people’s lives changed dramatically after he altered their appearance through plastic surgery, some people’s lives *didn’t*. He deduced that the primary factor that differentiated these groups was their self-image—not what they saw in the mirror but the images they had of themselves in their MINDS. Cool stuff.

He spent the second half of his career merging this self-image psychology with the then-popular science of “cybernetics”—which studies how things like guided missiles or “servo-mechanisms” hit their targets through a clear goal and constant adjustment of their course.

Here are some of the Big Ideas:

1. Cybernetics - Servo-mechanisms & you.
2. The Success Instinct - We’ve all got it!
3. Imagination - The first key.
4. Dehypnotize Yourself! - Starting now. :)
5. Rational Thought - How to use it.

Here’s to getting our Psycho-Cybernetic on as we set inspired goals, imagine our ideals, take action as we correct inevitable mistakes and practice FEELING our success. :)

Elias,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,"Self Image, the true success book","I have had many obstacles throughout life. The reasons for my obstacles finally dawned upon me through the wise words of Bob Proctor, as he mentioned the self image. He recommended a book on it, by Maxwell Maltz. Anyone who wants to make a change, a true change, this book is for you. If it's losing that weight for real, or getting that confidence, or daring to do amazing & out of the comfort zone things, then as mentioned THIS IS FOR YOU! Changing your self image and having an honest look on your self, will not only improve the quality of your life but those around you as well.

Nafiz Elgun,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,The best self book on mindset EVER!,"This book was recommended by a millionaire mentor of mine. This book has already started to help me immensely turn my brain and thoughts into an asset instead of it being a battlefield of negative thoughts and having the self image of myself as being unworthy and not believing in myself.

I remember reading reviews for this book only 2 months ago and trying to convince myself not to take the plunge despite all of the people saying this book changed their life.

Well...it was one of the best decisions I have made. And i confidently know I will use the practices in this book for the rest of my life to be a happy, confident, and strong goal-attacking person. Dr. Maltz's guidance is already starting to ring in my head almost daily.

I value the mental benefits of this book in the thousands honestly.

Just get it. Start. Do the practice exercises. Don't be judgmental of it and it will work for you.",2
WWF,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Salesmen and sports,"This Dan Kennedy revision of Maxwell Maltz's original Pscyho-cybernetics is in my opinion so geared towards salesmen and sports that if you're not a salesman, athlete, sports fan or an avid golfer, the text can be hard to get through. Sadly, Maltz's original version of Psycho-cybernetics is not offered as a Kindle book, which is why I bought this one.
Maltz's original, which I read as a teenager in the 70s, also featured athletes and salespeople, but Maltz was more inclusive in his approach. This new version should be entitled something like ""Psycho-cybernetics for Salesmen and Sports."" Salesmen and sports are great and important, but potential readers should at least be given some indication that Kennedy has taken Maltz's book so heavily in that direction so that they can decide whether or not it's really for them.",13
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Top 10 of all time.,"This is one of those few books that put forth a new idea that has not only stood the test of time but has been woven into the fabric of the entire self development industry. It's up there with ""Think and Grow Rich"" and "" How to win friends and influence people"".

It starts slow and after 2 or 3 chapters I was beginning to question the purchase. ""There is nothing to DO"" I thought. Then after it got going I felt there was TOO MUCH to do. Lots of excersises.

Of course, like so many things, the crux is in the application. Will you use it?

I think the thing I liked best is that you can really hear Dr Maltzs' passion for humanity and sincere desire to help. He seems like a wonderful man.

Also that he isn't in the pie-in-the-sky ""anyone can do anything"" camp. He teaches us to be truthful about our actual limitations, which do have limits, but are far above what most people do or even aspire to.

I put this on a short Must Read list of a handful of classics and consider it a must for anyone pursuing their full potential.

I bough this book for less than 10 dollars and I must say, this is one of the best investments I have ever made. Easy to read, this book's ideas MAKE SENSE and are profound. I'd like to save my biggest reviews for one chapter only: Unlock your personality. I read this chapter at time when I was depressed, because I didn't get along with people too well. I was reserved, shy and was a social dud. My entire college years, I've been a social dud. My social life sucked. It sucked because I didn't know how to get along with people - I was irritable with people and might have appeared mean to many. The chapter: Unlock your personality might have changed my life. To follow the chapter and its advices precisely requires faith in yourself. A great leap indeed. Don't think, says the late Dr. Maltz -and act. Thinking only complicates things further. Don't think, don't over analyze yourself and just BE. It might as well be a magic bullet. It was for me, I think. Read that chapter over, and over, and over and it will eventually click. Be yourself is the message - and don't think. In social situations, don't think - and just be. Just be. Read the chapter, and you will understand what I mean. ;)",14

Guillermo Velez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Worth the try for the cost,"Facts: It rook me months to do a decent job to relax and use the techniques described in the book. More than one reading and reading into details were necessary for me to grasp the right way to visualize what I wanted. The essentials of the book probably could me summarized in one chapter but the book includes a lot of examples, typical of this type of books. I did not achieve much the first couple of months on my first goal of reach my ideal weight. Then, my wife got me into a weight loss program and now I am well on my way to reach my goal. I keep doing the relaxation and visualization of reaching my ideal weight.

Opinion: I seek for a way to ""program"" the subconscious for a long time and this is the closest thing I have found. I started with a goal and the right tool just came along and I do not believe in coincidences. The weight loss program is making me loss weight. The techniques described in the book makes me follow the program with a very high level of discipline. The desire to reach my target weight is so high that I am able to sort almost all challenges I face to deviate from the weight loss program. I think that for the cost of the book is worth the try if you believe that you are a person of habit, that you behavior is ruled by your subconscious and you need to program that subconscious mind to change your behavior and achieve your goal",1

enya1978,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,A Book Ahead of its Time (and Ours),"This is the only book you need to read to be happy. I want to thank Mr. Maltz for this book, and express my regret that I did not find it when I was like, 12.

I knew it was a good book the minute I read ""You are not inferior. You are not superior. You are YOU"". I knew it was a good book when I read about how Maltz dismisses obtaining positive self image through ""willpower"". How many of you have heard well-meaning friends and coworkers say ""think positive"" about something that troubles you? How many of you have wondered why this well-meaning advice seldom helps? Maltz hits the nail on the head when he tells, and illustrates, why willpower and forcing positive thoughts into your head does not work. AND....he specifically tells you how to change your thought process so the positive thoughts come naturally. He gives you simple (but important) exercises to help you obtain and use the concepts he teaches.

I am a firm believe that once you have a positive image, life seems to turn out better. Not only does it look better through clear (instead of mud-shaded) glasses....but your new found self image will help you get the things you want. It will give you the power to go after what you want because you finally feel worthy. Instead of brainwashings and piecemeal advice, Maltz lays a solid groundwork using pure logic as to why YOU are worthy, and how you can convince yourself of this fact. He even gives concrete visuals to aid his lessons (healing emotional scars, much like facial scars). Emotional facelift.

This man is a genius. Do yourself a huge favor, buy this book and read it. Then read it again.",5

The sooner in life you can get these perspectives, the better for you and your loved ones. The theme in each chapter tends to develop somewhat slowly. Maltz tends to gather various points, from many different authors and sources, and takes some pages so that they coalesce into very significant and meaningful approaches to life that have immense practical value. And this is a workbook, meant to be used as a guide for your own personal work, which we all need to do very much of. Just reading it quickly through and moving on to the next book would be a huge waste.

I personally found much of the material to be ... not dense ... but dry. I hate to say that because Maltz is clearly such an intelligent man with an important message and helpful advice. But, it is true, in my opinion.

J,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,one of the most powerful books you will ever read,"honestly, quit wasting your money on cheesy current generation self help books like ""the secret"" or ""the power of now"". i'm only 26 and this book has helped me profoundly, increased my levels of happiness, self confidence, pretty much curbed my general anxiety levels, and has me looking at life from a whole new perspective. the author maxwell maltz wrote a book like this from the bottom of his heart, and you feel how contagious it is coming off the pages. i also have it on audiobook and listen to it going to and from work. it makes a difference trust me, because i NEVER write book reviews on amazon. i've only read it three times in the past month since i've had it and am now reading ""zero resistance selling"" by the same author and will also be purchasing ""zero resistance living"", the 90 day program, from the psycho-cybernetics.com site. if you want to understand why you act the way you do, why you perceive yourself the way you do, how you can gradually change that and KEEP it that way, and have plenty of aha moments about yourself, get this book. don't misunderstand, you will have to put in the work like anything else in life, but you WILL end up recommending it to everyone you know after you read it, believe me. my mom and my brother have now both read it and have both wondered why they didn't stumble upon this sooner, and they are practically non-readers. you are worth it, get on this already.",5
Mr H,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,A great book.,"Before ""The Law Of Attraction"", there was simply this book. It works because it uses the same principles and it shows you how to make it work for you.

A great book.",1
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Still A Great Book,"I originally read this as a condensed book in Reader's Digest magazine back in the early 1960's, and then bought the book itself. After several moves, it was lost. I recently repurchased it due to it's past impact on my thinking. A primary point that the late Dr. Maltz emphasized was his observation that plastic surgery had unexpected results with different people. For some, a minor correction caused a major personality change for the better. For others, even where the cosmetic change was more pronounced, the person's personality changed little, if at all. He attributed this to the person's innner / self image. Another key point was the power of visualization, that, if vivid / realistic enough, can have the same effect on the brain as if actually seeing / doing, a point now used regularly in sports training, et al. Both these points and others helped me immensely through my teen years and into early adulthood to break out of my ""shell"", and minimize the tendency to prejudge outcomes or approach change / the unknown negatively. The fact that his book continues to sell, and that there are several spin-offs, is testimony to the timelessness of these points.",4

Shantel Ruiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Straight Shooter,"In an effort to understand why I have a strong tendency to ""doubt"" myself in many situations where I rationally know I excel, I bought this book and read it cover to cover.
I found the author Dr. Maltz to be incredibly insightful and the no nonsense way he delivered the information was rather refreshing. I've read my fair share of ""self help"" books and I can honestly
say that most of them carry on a lot about psychological mumbo jumbo, but NOT this one! Dr Maltz is a serious straight shooter and he really just says it like it is. I found many of the ideas he presented to cause ""ah ha"" moments inside me and the information is also very relevant, even in todays world which at first I thought might be an issue since this book was written many years ago. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a way to better understand their self-image and in essence make it better.
By far my favorite part of the book is the idea he delivers that we don't need to dredge up our past and relive it and ""figure it out"" in order to get over it. He just basically says, forget it, and move on! I LOVED THAT!! It makes me feel free from past baggage that I thought may have been holding me back. Really a great book!

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Best book for self development I've found,"I have been studying psychology for the past 3 years at least, and have delved into topics such as NLP, hypnosis, destructive patterns etc. I have studied each of these topics and more in great depth and detail, and have to say that this book is by far the most treasured possession I own. This book is what I consider to be the answer, the key to all of self development. If you want to accomplish ANYTHING and you are not, there is a reason for it, and this book can help you. If you will read it, and then re-read it, and then re-read it, until you begin to fully understand and comprehend the principles and concepts presented, it will change your life....dramatically.

The book's whole premise is that we all behave not according to how things actually are, but how we perceive them to be. As a result of this, our beliefs can be very skewed, and thus our behavior will be as well. It is the task of this book to teach and instruct the reader in how to recognize irrational beliefs, use rational conscious thought to determine what they want to believe instead, and then use principles such as ""theater in the mind"" and ""acting as if"" to create a new reality experienced by your mind, which will program your self image, and thus create a new objective reality around you.

My personal opinion is that this book contains the key, the solution to any problem you are currently having, which you want to change but don't know how to, or are unsure of where to start. I highly recommend it.",8
Gadgeteer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,"Written decades ago, but still pertinent","Dr. Maltz, originally a face surgeon, came to recognize in his patients a need for a positive self image, which need transcended the physical characteristics that patients wanted improved.

He compares the methodology of achieving a desired improvement in one's self image with that used in the design of modern physical automatic control systems (he uses the term ""Cybernetics"" to describe the servomechanism systems of his day, such as those used in military fire control systems).

The concept is imaginative, and Dr. Maltz uses most of his book to describe various methods for helping change one's self image to the one that is desired, presumably by using negative feedback control to minimize the difference between one's current self image and one's desired self image, similar in concept to how military fire control systems operate.

While the basic ideas presented by Dr. Maltz are intriguing the human brain is so much more complex than the design of a military fire control system that the basic concepts presented must be taken with this important limitation in mind.

The fact that book is still in print after many decades and has sold many millions of copies, however, is a tribute to some validity of Dr. Maltz's basic concepts.",3

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Great book,"I purchased the updated version of this book first (edited by Dan Kennedy), and then bought this one. I would definitely recommend this one, because although Dan Kennedy means well, the updated version just has too much stuff in it, and it's easy to lose sight of the forest for all the trees, so to speak. This book has all the nuts and bolts of psycho cybernetics in it, and you won't need another one if you really study and read it.
If you're really trying to change your life, or a certain habit, or any other kind of personal change, this is the book for you. It's the science of how the mind works - and it's more fundamental than anything by Tony Robbins, The Secret, Hypnosis, and NLP. This book is extravagant and foundational for personal change and I'd recommend it with the highest level I possibly could for everyone.

Reggie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Nothing psycho about ths book,"Not for the novice reader.

Psychocybernetics doesn't teach you what to think, but HOW to think in such a way that your entire life will be transformed. Improve yourself in any area, sports, your job, your love life, simply by readjusting your approach to the world. Maxwell Maltz exposes the secrets of how powerful our thoughts are. And he offers scientific proof to back it up. Maxwell Maltz tells it better than most anybody else I've read.

I first encountered this book back in the early 80's. I didn't know it then but my life was being transformed into something pretty amazing and this was one of the books that helped me change the entire course of my life.

Phil Saparov,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Life-changing read,"I used the advice presented in this book to bring about major change with great results at least twice.
First, when I sprained my knee and tore my ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament), I used the concept of striving towards a goal and thinking of my physical body as a servo-mechanism to heal myself. Where I got the method of healing is a whole 'nother story. But the concept of driving yourself towards an image of Health instead of trying to get away from disease really helped.

It no longer mattered what exactly was wrong with my knee - whether it was a partial or complete tear, or whether one or two menisci had been torn, and to which degree. The idea was to focus on the solution instead of the problem. It took me about 3 months to get back to living a normal life, where I could dance, run, and even do heavy squats again.

The second time I used this concept was when I had completely exhausted my system as a result of emotionally and physically draining work that I had been doing for a long time and for too many hours per week. At some point, all of a sudden, I got a whole host of physical and emotional problems, the worst of which was a pretty severe case of depression.

I changed my job, and went in for different therapies, some of which helped to a degree. But I attribute most of the success, especially in the emotional part, to Psychocybernetics. You see, different therapists analyzed my condition and tried to heal each of the causes that might have had an ill effect on me. This made me focus too much on the causes, which were the problem, instead of focusing on the solution.

Once again, I armed myself with Psychocybernetics and went to work. It took me about 3-4 months to feel almost 100% again. But the most important thing that I remember was that as soon I started to focus on the image of health and think about all the things I would do as soon as I was better, that's when my healing really took off.

Buy it. Use it.
Best,

Phil Saparov",13

I've only been using this method a couple of months, but it is nicer. Some hypnotists recommended to me that I get an older edition of this book, one that has not been messed with by any other additional authors, so I got this one.

Don - Rotterdam NY,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Psycho-Cybernetcs: I Wish I Had Read This When I Was 20 Years Old!!!,"This is a terrific book, filled with concepts that you can put to work right now.

I recommend it highly to everyone.",1

It is the granddaddy of personal development books. Truly an inspired, powerful piece of writing. BUT, do get the original version. Despite the years and social changes, this is the one to read.",1
dr_shock,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Classic book to get your sh$% together.,"It is important to get one's stuff together. This is a timeless book written by a very perceptive individual. Many paths lead to his conclusions. I'm not a religious person and it is clear that Maltz is, which would normally irritate me. However, the content of this book is very pragmatic and refreshing.

I don't think anyone can get much out of this book if they don't do the exercises and re-visit these ideas on a regular basis. It is a great book for gaining awareness of one's self image. For the price, I recommend this book to anyone. And I do so frequently.",1

Martin Zakostelsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Classic masterpiece still shining,"After reading quite a few self-help and self-examination books, this is the book I was waiting for. Although at first I was quite skeptical because of the age of the book (I though ""Would there be something new for me, would the ideas be still valid?""), after first several pages doubts dissolved and I was entirely caught.

I believe all the reviews have said already enough, so I'll keep my review short. This book has all that I want from it:
- Down-to-earth style without exaggerations. Yet very strong and moving content, explaining how human brain works, what brings us happiness/more life, and how to achieve it.
- Positive :o). Gives reader so much energy into his life.
- No easy-read. Should be read definitely more times than once.

Simply put, this is a must read in the area of self-help/psychology books.

Some of favorite quotes:

""The self-image is changed, for better or worse, not by intellect alone, nor by intellectual knowledge alone, but by ""experiencing."" Wittingly or unwittingly you developed your self-image by your creative experiencing in the past. You can change it by the same method. "" (page x)
""One of the most pleasant thoughts to any human being is the thought that he is needed, that he is important enough to help and add to the happiness of some other human being."" (page 97)

""Since man is a goal striving being, he is functioning naturally and normally when he is oriented toward some positive goal and striving toward some desirable goal. Happiness is a symptom of normal, natural functioning and when man is functioning as a goal-striver, he tends to feel fairly happy, regardless of circumstances."" (page 101)

""Our habits are not accidental, or happenstance. We have them because they fit us. They are consistent with our self-image and our entire personality pattern. When we consciously and deliberately develop new and better habits, our self-image tends to outgrow the old habits and grow into the new pattern. "" (page 108)

""To give the other person credit for being sincere, if mistaken, rather than willful and malicious, can do much to smooth out human relations and bring about better understanding between people. Ask yourself, ""How does this appear--to him?"" ""How does he interpret this situation?"" ""How does he feel about it?"" Try to understand why he might ""act the way he does."""" (page 115)

""Man maintains his balance, poise, and sense of security only as he is moving forward--or seeking. When you think of yourself as having attained the goal, you become static, and you lose the security and equilibrium you had when you were moving towards something. The man who is convinced that he is ""good"" in the absolute sense, not only has no incentive to do better, but he feels insecure because he must defend the sham and pretense."" (page 137)

""Regardless of your feelings, force yourself to mix and mingle with other people. After the first cold plunge, you will find yourself warming up and enjoying it if you persist. Develop some social skill that will add to the happiness of other people: dancing, bridge, playing the piano, tennis, conversation. It is an old psychological axiom that constant exposure to the object of fear immunizes against the fear. As the lonely person continues to force himself into social relations with other human beings--not in a passive way, but as an active contributor--he will gradually find that most people are friendly, and that he is accepted. His shyness and timidity begin to disappear. He feels more comfortable in the presence of other people and with himself. The experience of their acceptance of him enables him to accept himself."" (page 139)

""If responding and reacting to negative feedback does not take us further down the road to our own goal--or serve our ends, then there is no need to respond at all. And, if response of any kind gets us off course, or works against us--then no response is the appropriate response."" (page 199)

""If life adapts itself in so many varied forms to act as a means toward an end, is it not reasonable to assume that if we place ourselves in the sort of goal-situation where more life is needed, that we will receive more life?"" (page 261)",7

Just put your doubts aside and BUY THIS BOOK today.
Right now while you are thinking about it. The sooner you get it, the sooner you will benefit from its simple effective techniques.
Whatever you do, don't put it off for tomorrow. You know you will just forget about it and then it will be a MAJOR OPPORTUNITY LOST.
Just make the simple effort right now to order a copy and you will be buying a lotto ticket that is virtually certain to PAY OFF BIG for you.
It costs [very little money] and if applied even a little bit, it is likely to change your life. How many other things that cost [this little] can you say that about.
The original edition DID change MY life about 10 years ago and I know at least 5 other people who point to this book (and another classic-Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill) as major keys to their personal philosophy and success in life.
This revised edition is even better than the original due to the care put into it by Dan Kennedy, who is keeping Dr. Maltz's work alive for the present generation with this timely update.
I liked it so much I have bought 5 more copies for some great business associates as gifts.

Put the techniques that have made many ordinary people appear to be extraordinary to work for you. You don't have to work harder, you just need to apply these amazing principals to your current methods and your will be so much more effective.
I also highly recommended ""Zero Resistance Selling"" for sales persons as a companion to this book which specializes the same techniques to Sales careers.",9

J. K. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,This book is different`,"It's so easy to see how this book has sold over 30,000,000 copies. I can honestly say that I think this book has ended my search for the ""perfect"" self-help book.
After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to buy this book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I've had the book for one week now and I am already seeing results.
About 3 years ago I entered into the world of sales and all of a sudden I became painfully aware of my self-image or my self-esteem as others call it. I became very self-conscious and started down a slippery slope into the world of negative thinking and emotions that weren't helping me at all.
So I did what any person would do who wants to overcome their limiting beliefs and learn how to overcome negative thinking and I started buying self-help litereature. my library is chocked full of books from all the greats. Well I learned something from all the books that I read, but I just felt there was always something missing. I didn't feel like I had the information that I needed to really turn it all around. I tried ""Affirmations"" etc. with marginal results.
Then I found this book. Maxwell talks about how we act, feel and perform is in direct relation to how we imagine ourselves to be. You may need to read that last sentence again because it's what helped me to start putting it all together. He then gives techniques for changing your self-image and overcoming your negative thinking that really works.
I'm very grateful to Maxwell for writing this book. He really put his heart into it and made a masterpiece!
Please don't make the mistake of not buying this book. It could well be the best money you ever spent! God Bless!",21

There are stories and additional paragraphs of information that you're not quite sure what to do with and it clouds the original ideas. Anyone can make a book longer with lots of extra info but a nicely summarized and boiled down series of thoughts is difficult to do so get the original because that's what it is; I just ordered the original again and will leave this ""updated"" copy in the hotel I'm staying in right now.",22

LindaT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,A Good Thing Made Even Better,"I heard about the first PSYCHO CYBERNETICS book in the 60's (yes, I am over 21 years old) and when I read it I thought it was wonderful. In fact, I thought that if I only would be able to have one self-help book, it would be this one.
THE NEW PSYCHO CYBERNETICS has taken a good book and made it even better. The masterful editing and adapting by Dan Kennedy is great. It still is done in the voice of the original author, Dr. Maxwell Maltz, but it has up to date examples of people most of us know from this time in history, yet it still includes the examples Dr. Maltz wrote about in his original book.
The theme hasn't changed -- Dr. Maltz claimed that the human mind has a ""servo-mechanism"" which can help us accomplish what we desire, but we must let it do its work once the desire is ""fed into"" the mind. He drew upon his knowledge of the then fledgling work of computers. And now in the 21st century, computers have advanced in an unbelievable manner, and yet the principle behind which they work is still the same; the goal-striving mechanism which works towards its teleological end by negative feedback, correction, and positive feedback.
I have other self help books, but for me, this one is the basis on which all the others are carried out.
I can't recommend it highly enough.",23

This book is a modern treatment of Maltz's original book and has made it even more palatable and applicable in daily life. The exercises are simple, straightforward and effective. One just needs to practice.
You're not reading this book to be enlightened to salvation or something (which you can read the Holy Bible for!) but rather, this book prepares your mind to set goals in the daily routine of life. It is about setting goals, and consciously thinking how you could achieve them, letting your subconscious autopilot ""servo-mechanism"" help you on the way there through deliberate practical exercises. This book is even more readable than the original.
Very readable, very practical, and no ""mind power"" mystical nonsense. Just straight cut practical tips to sharpen the mind.",12
Ramon Acosta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,The first and foremost,"Without a doubt, Dr. Maltz' classic is still on top of the heap of self-help books, tapes and seminars available. Everything that was relevant in late 1950 and early 1960 is still relevant today. Unless humans fundamentally change the way the brain operates, this book will be a classic text on the process of communicating with and reprogramming the inner self.

There's only one downside about this book. If you don't try the mental techniques, nothing will change. You might manufacture a new line of thinking after absorbing the material, but if you don't practice and apply it on a near daily basis, then you've merely read one of the greatest psychology texts of all time. A bit of mental elbow grease will instead allow you to experience this book and the profound change you and your loved ones can all potentially benefit from.",7

Rubin Wald,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Great Update of a Classic!,"Dan Kennedy has done a brilliant job of giving Dr. Maltz's classic text a contemporary feel while remaining true to the original version.
I still have my 1974 Pocket Book edition of Psycho-Cybernetics and its ideas and insights helped me a lot in understanding life and success and how I could control my own destiny.
This updated version is even better! I especially liked the PRESCRIPTION and MENTAL TRAINING EXERCISE boxes that Mr. Kennedy has strategically placed throughout the book. They contain very clear suggestions and practical exercises for living an abundant and fulfilling life. For example, he prescribes keeping a ""success diary"" as a tool for building a stronger self-image. And on page 201, there is an powerful exercise for developing the all important habit of forgiveness.
One of the insights Dr. Maltz gave me that helped clarify my own life journey was his understanding that our unconscious minds cannot distinguish between a real experience and the same experience vividly imagined. Years later I found confirmation for this idea in Quantum Physics.
Nobel Prize winning Physicist Niels Bohr's Complementarity Principle shows us that the mental aspect of an imagined experience is complementary to its physical aspect. Both are equally 'real'. No wonder imagination and visualization are such valuable skills to master for anyone who wants to transform their dreams into physcial reality.
I wonder if Dr. Maltz and Dr. Bohr ever had a conversation!
Dan Kennedy has done a tremendous favor for anyone who wants knowledge and practical applications for being more successful. I applaud his efforts.",38

Ken Nuehs,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Unlocked My Success Mechanism,"As of last night, I finished the most amazing book called Psycho Cybernetics, by Maxwell Maltz. I am proud to say this is the first book that I have completed all the way through in over a year. I bought this book back in 2009 when I was fighting the boredom in Iraq and remember only reading a few chapters. After I learned that it was a recommended reading by some of the leaders in Empower Network, I decided to dust it off and see how the top earners have used this book to unlock their success mechanisms and start living a more fulfilling life.

And boy, I'm glad I did!

This powerful book has provided so much value to my life. I now know the power of imagination and have started to imagine successful outcomes when going through a sales presentation, public speaking presentations, and any areas of my life that I'm not completely comfortable and confident in.

And let me tell you the concepts in Psycho Cybernetics works!

I've had my best month in personal training sales at the gym with over $3,000 in sales in just the first 3 weeks. One sale worth $1,950. My previous best was $1,800 for the full month.

The advice on happiness and forgiveness are something of a new-age, but conventional, as well.
I understood every part of it, and it is a book I look back into.

1) After reading, I took a different approach to my world
2) Before reading, I hadn't known some of the topics, and their expenditure
3) While reading, I was hooked. I could keep going for its lessons

This new edition is, amazingly enough, even better than the original. It's clearer, easier to follow, and even more compelling. I'll always be grateful to the person who recommended this to me when I was 20 years old. Twenty two years later, I'm living a life most people only dream of.

A User,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Better Than the Original; Max Would Have Been Proud,"Greetings:
Join us at the Psycho-Cybernetics discussion group on [...]
To date, I have bought three hardcover editions of the New Psycho-Cybernetics (NPC): one I gave to a friend, one I take with me to read during the day, and one I keep in my home office to work with on those days when I work at home. I have found it a significant improvement upon the original. (I have used up three paperback versions of the original over the last 10 years.)
I remember when I first read the original version of PC, in around 1990. I thought it was somewhat hokey. I used to be an engineer, and I thought it somewhat strange to try to apply feedback control systems theory to people. We are not machines, after all.
The strange thing, though, was that the system worked for me. Still, I was somewhat embarrassed about the whole thing, so I sort of kept my dabbling to myself.
Then, in the mid-late nineties, I read Fritjof Capra's book, The Web of Life. In that book, Capra talks a lot about systems theory, and he also goes into the history of the original cybernetics group (not Psycho cybernetics, but rather a group of mathematicians, psychologists, biologists, and physicists who collaborated in WWII to create anti-aircraft guns that could effectively track and destroy enemy aircraft). In his discussion, Capra explains that the original cybernetics group's goal was to try to make machines that could do what people and animals do naturally and easily, without conscious thought. They tried to do this, in part, by observing the actions of animals and people. Based on such observation, the group devised the early foundation of what became our modern science of systems control as used in almost every modern electrical/mechanical system.
What Maltz tried to do was take a bit of the science and art of systems control and apply it back to people, in an attempt to improve their functioning. I think one of the original cyberneticists, Norbert Weiner, also tried to do this in his book, The Human Use of Human Beings, but I could be wrong.
Anyway, because Psycho-Cybernetics is based on systems theory, in contrast to other types of ""self help"" or positive thinking books, it recognizes that a person trying to achieve her goals is going to fail, and miss what she is pursuing, probably many times on her way to her destination. Rather than candy coating this fact and suggesting ""positive thinking,"" PC suggests feedback control system oriented techniques to use, deal with, and not be completely stymied by such failures.
It also provides techniques to help one deal with ""drama queen"" co-workers and supervisors who seem to go out of their way to provide damaging negative feedback (e.g., ignoring negative feedback in ch. 11, ""How to Unlock Your Real Personality""), or retarding how fast responds to negative feed back (e.g., delaying the response, as in ch. 12 ""Do It Yourself Tranquilizers that Bring Peace of Mind."").

Now, on to the new version of PC: my own opinion is that it is better than the original. Dan follows the original structure of the PC book, and much of the text is in common. However, Dan has buttressed that text with additional examples taken from the many hours of recordings and reams of Maltz' notes that Dan owns. In addition, Dan also provides many practical examples of the successful application of PC techniques that have arisen since the original version of the book was published in 1960.
Try NPC. If, like me, you have areas in your life where you would like to do better, I think you will find it useful.",48

Dr. Maxwell Maltz's classic has been re-worked and updated several times over the years. Personally, I still like the original best of all.

It's apparent that this book was written before drugs were prevelant in our society because there's no outlandish statements, no grey area, and it's actually down to earth and makes sense.

Get this book it will change your life and the way you think. You want to change your life start working on changing the way you think.,1
Susil Manchanayaka,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Understand Yourself,"I bought this book and read it. It is interesting for many reasons. I am a lover of books and I am married to books (metaphorically). Why I say that this book is interesting is that it is life changing. The few dollars I spent on this book is worth and I learnt a lot by reading this book. The chapters are shorter and easy to grasp. Some ideas may be unfamiliar to a novice reader but if you are an experienced and an avid reader, you can get at the gist of the book.

Many people have complexes (psychological) and they struggle to come out of the shell they live in. This book helps you to see the world as it is and you can transform your life with ideas from the book. The ideas in the book are worth remembering and practicing. If you are into understanding the nature of human mentality, behavior and why people do certain things but why they are afraid of doing certain things is interesting. In our lives we undergo numerous pains and we sometimes become depressed and helpless. This book helps anyone to see the world as it is.

The writer is an experienced professional in his field and particularly this book helps one to be motivated, enthusiastic in anything she does and develop confidence. He is a leading scholar and a much respected counselor. I read about his biography on the net and I was very impressed. He is an authority on his subject. I can say that this book is a booster - it boosts your performance. It is light reading.

Maltz takes the reader into an unexplored area of human mentality, how to overcome fears, the basis of fear and personal development. He helps the reader overcome fears. He argues that most of the fears we have are all baseless and unscientific. Fears come out of ignorance. Fears come out of wrong perceptions we have. Fears come out of not being exposed to the world we live in. That is what he says.

The book is pocket sized and you can carry it when you travel. It is like a handbook on personal development. If you have any interest in mentoring, counseling, public speaking or teaching, this is the next book you may consider reading.

I personally like the ideas in the book. The time you may spend will be worth the trouble you take to read this book. The chapters in it are short and run into a couple of pages and at a single sitting you can read a chapter. Make this book a partner in your life. It is worth buying and keeping in your private library. In life one may experience ups and downs. Tribulations in life are part of human existence on this planet. We seek advice from others, counselors, teachers or if you belong to a profession of respect - mentors. This book is a companion mentor. If you are in need of some expert advice, consult this book. Discuss what is in it. It will pay rich dividends.

The final verdict on the book is that it is a book of interesting ideas for us to be human. It is a book that teaches us how to face life. It is a book that teaches us live happily. It is a book that teaches us how to help others in need. My friends, read it. You will soon see a dramatic transformation in your life. It is life changing and mind changing. The contents of the book are to be digested (metaphorically). The ideas in the book by Maltz (the writer) will enlighten you all.

N/A,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,bizzare...,"My big problem with this book is the material that Dan Kennedy added. While it provides useful background and some updated examples, Kennedy weaves it in seemlessly into the old material. What you get is confusion. The first person of Kennedy is mixed in with the first person of Maltz, without being differentiated in any way! So in the same section, you have someone speaking of ""my patients"" in the '40's or '50's, and then the same voice speaking of ""my experiences"" with a Kevin Costner movie or a Michael Jordan anecdote. There is no change in typeface, or paragraph structure to indicate that different people are writing, one long-dead, the other alive and ""editing"" this book. Why didn't Kennedy's editor make him place his commentary separately?
This was enough to spoil most of the usefulness of this edition for me. I suggest noting the boxed exercises that Kennedy includes, which are useful, and then reading the original of the book.",53

Jon Torodash,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,A pioneer in the field still standing strong,"I don't make it a habit to read self-help books, but the off-color fitness guru Matt Furey has made a killing on selling a program based off of Maltz's work, and most other ""motivational speakers"" usually bend a knee in respect to Maltz as a forerunner. So I picked up a cheap used copy and read it cover to cover. The only question I have left is why anyone would bother with any of the other crap. This book effectively condenses the entirety of the self-help field. As far as I can tell, this is as good as it gets by the standards of the genre, is enjoyably accessible to a general audience, and has weathered time's attack on its relevance stunningly well.

Firstly, Maltz had the raw clinical experience necessary to write this kind of book. As a crackerjack plastic surgeon he saw immediately and firsthand the life-changing or life-stalling power of self-image at work in the faces of his patients. (And anyone who scoffs at unorthodox contributors to a research field ought to know that Albert Einstein was working for the Swiss patent office when he submitted the Theory of Special Relativity.) Yet Maltz also admits where exactly the limits of his knowledge lie rather than try to convince the reader of his omniscience.

Secondly, Maltz was receptive to many fundamental tenets of psychology and philosophy and works them into Psycho Cybernetics clearly and without contradiction. Nor does he try to repackage ancient metaphysical hokum with inane and feeble examples.

Thirdly, there are no workshops, special reports, live phone help, or products to buy. (Though I cannot speak for the organization that has cropped up around Maltz's name.) All pretense and exaggeration for marketing purposes seem absent from his book.

Maltz was definitive and unequivocal in his ideas, quick to set a standard and stick to it. He took seriously some very fundamental issues of life and makes clear statements. This book rises high above the haphazard pop philosophy/ethics smeared all over mass media which are either shallow and weak or imperiously stupid. Maltz simply faced the truth of his own convictions. Psycho Cybernetics by no means outlines life management skills as an exact science, but its frank suggestions are intellectually compelling. Overall, the book is worthwhile because Maltz' honest and non-condescending style at least earns your respect, if not your belief.",467

Jay Johnson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Horribly Boring Book,"This book will put you to sleep. Unfortunately I bought it based on all the high reviews. I guess I missed something.

Each chapter seemed to ramble on and on. It is a lengthy book and it seems like a lot of the chapter content was redundant saying the same thing over. The book discusses one's self image, happiness, success and how to evaluate it in life.

The author has a section about SUCCESS (sense of direction, understanding, courage, charity, esteem, self confidence and self acceptance). However each of these bullet points were very basic principles. Same applies to his chapter on FAILURE (frustration, aggressiveness, insecurity, lonliness, uncertainty, resentment and emptiness). Again, very basic material.

For me the last third of the book was more boring than the other two-thirds. It was a hard book to finish being so uninteresting. I can't recommend this book.",6

Christian Rosenkreutz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics and Self-Fulfillment,Outdated psuedo-science,"I consider myself to be pretty open-minded, especially in regards to the potentials of the human mind, but this book actually reads like a laundry list of little ""fixes"" to do with your life, and reads more like a precursor to infomercial formats than to gaining any kind of insight whatsoever.

The author declares right away that he is not a psychologist, but considers himself qualified (and believe me, I am not a fan of the word ""qualified"" by any means) and continues to compare himself to Einstein, Madam Curie, Wright Brothers (should I have to mention all of their minds actually created advances that changes the entire world without question?) all in the preface, before you even get to the table of contents, which I will briefly list a few entries:

""your key to a better life""

""the success mechanism within you""

""first key to success mechanism""

""dehypnotize yourself""

""let your success mechanism work for you""

""habit of happiness""

""success-type personality""

""failure mechanism""

""how to give yourself an emotional facelift""

""do-it-yourself tranquilizers that bring peace of mind""

I won't go any further, although there are more. My problem is that not only is this self-proclaimed ""scientist/psychologist"" coining new terms, he does it in a very QVC way. I am all for understanding the programming we submit ourselves to, and ways to understand the mind, and patterns of thought, however this book is a waste of time, only for the mindless reader that in fact turns off their brain to read this book (the author actually asks you to do that while reading, its in one of the first chapters, right after he tries to convince the reader that ""telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition have been established by scientific laboratory experiments."" That is the actual sentence from page 24. I would be delighted by nothing more than to get ahold of these ""scientific laboratory experiments"" data records to see this for myself.

The rest is filled with case studies that have bee refuted, ideas that are no longer valid and lots, and lots of God talk. When the author runs up against the wall of lack of evidence he just simply states ""and this is where science runs out so we need to turn to religion"". Instead of posing questions about what needs to come and pondering on the advancements that will be achieved by science he just simply states ""God made you this way now be happy with it.""

Gordon D Sheret,5.0 out of 5 stars,Drums along the Mohawk,An easy read that gives a sense of devastation of the ...,"An easy read that gives a sense of devastation of the Revolutionary War on the New York frontier. Stalin is supposed to have said that a single death is a tragedy, a million deaths a statistic. So when Richard Berleth in ""Bloody Mohawk"" whites: ""Refugees returning to the Mohawk Valley in the period between 1783 and 1784 found hardly a barn or house standing from Fonda to German Flats."" he gives us the statistics, Edmonds provides the tragedy. Chronicled are Gilbert & Lanna (Magdelana) Martin, newlyweds, and their lives through the war. Their homestead is in Deerfield, a community consisting of a handful of settlers near the end of white settlement on the Mohawk River. Their isolation invites an early raid that burns the homes and barns and displaces the entire community to a slightly more secure fort down river. History tends to teach the Revolutionary War as a series of strategic events, however on the frontier the guerilla war was a constant struggle, often fought between former neighbors. Although the Martins and their neighbors are fictional the events closely follow history as do the names, and personalities of leaders. If you are interested in the history of this period I don't think you will be disappointed.",3
F. Davis,4.0 out of 5 stars,Drums along the Mohawk,Way better than the movie.....,"Historically, this book is right on. I never like reading about battles and military strategy, but I have a feeling the accounts are historically accurate to a detail. Some of the language is even archaic enough that I had to use my dictionary, and some of the words weren't in the dictionary at all. The story line is not the best element of the book, but the life of the sometime soldier/sometime pioneer farmers and their wives is what kept me reading. The depiction of the Indians of this area and time would be nothing short of politically incorrect, but probably accurate? The eloquent descriptions of revolutionary, wild New York state countryside, survival in the wilderness, and early pioneer farm life are the best thing about it. Aside from skimming the battle discussions, I really enjoyed this book.",3

Chantel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Soapbox-Momster: Cyber Stalker of the Abyss (Cyber Thrillers),"Great amount of knowledge with a decent story, but had it's fair share of problems.","I was provided a free copy of Soapbox-Momster: Cyber Stalker of the Abyss from the author. After reading the story I had a few concerns. This book follows a cyber stalker who is out to get revenge on all the people she assumes cons people out of money for their own gain. It eventually turns on her and she ends up being the one who is stalked.

Although the story is decent, there are several grammatical errors that, for me, were hard to overlook. Not only were there plenty of grammatical errors, but there were errors in the storyline as well. For example, in a certain chapter, Holbrook is speaking about a family which has the father, mother, and to start with, an 18 year-old daughter and a 10 year-old son. By the end of the chapter, the family has turned into the father, mother, and two daughters. As simple as that may be, it is very important to keep those facts straight.

It was also a bit confusing considering that the author jumped around in the story A LOT. One minute he would be talking from one characters point of view and the next minute it would be in another characters point of view. Had he made some indication that he was moving from one character to another, it may have worked better, but this was from one paragraph to another, causing a jumping effect from the heads of the characters. I was also confused about the major jumps in years. Throughout the entire book, he would jump forward 6 years or so and I felt like I was missing out on so much information.

On the other hand, the story was decent, as mentioned before, and the obvious research Holbrook has done was fantastic. The reader could obviously tell that when technical things were being discussed, Holbrook knew what he was talking about. It is always good to read a book where the author actually knows what he/she wants to say and has a background to say it correctly.",2
Mana G,3.0 out of 5 stars,Soapbox-Momster: Cyber Stalker of the Abyss (Cyber Thrillers),A circle of revenge indeed,"Trolls exist, especially on the internet. Scroll through any YouTube comment feed or popular Facebook post and you’ll find that some of them make it a near full-time job to put others down and ruin reputations.

But more on that later.
The story begins with the murder of Camellia’s mother, who had photos taken while having intercourse with the banker (to later be used as blackmail). This and that happen and Camellia (naming herself after her mother) ends up staging the banker’s suicide of some sorts to avenge her mother’s ‘accident’. She then proceeds to defame the banker through word of mouth and the Internet. As it turns out, the banker is the grandfather of the character ‘Donavan’.

Camellia defames more than just Donavan’s banker throughout the book. She enrages enough people that a father of one of her victims ends up killing her boss. His death seals what she truly is. A snitch. A snipe. A gossip. A troll. To go into more detail would spoil the plotline, but unlike what the one-star review says, this is most definitely a fiction book. It’s written by someone who knows the horrors of an Internet troll, but nonetheless it is fiction.

All in all, it’s an entertaining story. I enjoyed the plotline very much as well as the detail that went into creating the book’s ‘world’.",2

It seems like this book really means a lot to him--it's pretty clear that he's drawn inspiration from similar events in his real life--and I'm glad he opens the book with a discussion about cyber bullying. It's a huge problem, and while the book portrays a fictional event of such an occurrence (and an entertaining one, at that!), I'm happy we're getting some representation of the matter.

Mia Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Soapbox-Momster: Cyber Stalker of the Abyss (Cyber Thrillers),Interesting Tale to Enjoy in Your Leisure Time,"This is a very interesting and enjoyable book and I read this on one sitting. The language is very descriptive and it clearly transfers the author's pure imagination on to reader's mind.

We have seen public figures burnt down because of blackmailing and how they have lost their reputation as well. Some do these for fun and some do these for their own personal gain as well. The story begins with a circus crew taking photos of Townson-a banker having an intercourse with one of their members. Trying to blackmail him he refuses to pay and their plans fail. Later on Carmellia visits Townson and he dies because of the shock caused hearing her big lie. Years later his wife tells about the past incident to her grandson Donovan who is a secret service agent involved in busting cyber crimes. Carmellia has done this kind of blackmailing many times and her gossip articles have even caused loss of the life of her boss Joel as well. The story is well woven around these facts and it captures the reader's mind from the very first page to the last.

This story is fantastic and it provides powerful moral for the reader as well. I found this highly enjoyable in my leisure time. I recommend you to read this.",2

Daisy Jordan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Colony,"""next to colder oceans, in sharper air...""","Colony drew me in from page 1, when the narrator, Maude, paints an eerie picture of sitting alone on a porch in a deserted summer colony on Penobscot Bay, Maine, as the fog rolls in. From there, I couldn't put it down. Colony is mesmerizing. The love story, the sharp, cold beauty of Maine, the weird way in which the story interacts with time. And, of course, the should-have-seen-it-coming-from-the-prologue shocker that probably very few readers actually see coming, that makes you reevaluate the view you've had of the Peter/Maude love story for 600 pages. This book is tragic and beautiful, and the atmosphere created by Anne Rivers Siddons keeps you turning the pages, unable to tear yourself away, just like Maude is unable to tear herself away from those summers in Maine. It's like the fog has surrounded you and won't lift until you finish the book. :)",1

In 1961, It did much more than just put me on my quest for self-improvement. For the very first time, someone connected the mind to the body and brought home the old, simple adage ... ""Change your Mind and you change your life!""

That was Psycho-Cybernetics. That was the principle of Self Image Psychology ... proven and verified by science itself as an irresistible and powerful no nonsense psychology of happiness and fulfillment.

From there on ... for decades ... everything else that was printed in the Self Help Industry became supporting commentary for the principles in this book.

An now ... the new ""enhanced"" version of Psycho-Cybernetics just arrived. And Yesssss!!! I enjoyed this one as much as the original. If not more so!

Comparing the two, the new authors kept the voice and the insights of the original text intact, integrating only the updates needed for new generations to come to experience and cherish the joy of reading this old, new classic for the first time. And experience it, you will. You cannot do otherwise.

Indeed, it gives me great pleasure to recommend this new version of the book that's been around for over a half century. If you are not among the 35 million+ people who read the older one ... please, do yourself a favor ... get a copy now and read it!

You will find that Psycho-Cybernetics will do it to you, as it did it to us, decades ago. True to its kind, the new Enhanced version of Psycho-Cybernetics is still the only book that scientifically proves the principle of Self Image Psychology and makes it the new foundation for a new century's hope, success and the dream of a better life.

And the beat goes on!",43

Between issues in my finances, health, relationships, career, I was being weighed down by it all. I've come across and read a lot from people like Jack Canfield, Joel Osteen, Law of Attraction - Teachings of Abraham, etc. They were all good, uplifting and helpful works in their own right, but something was missing. I was listening to a podcast and the host mentioned this book, which was something I've never heard about - ever or anywhere. I looked it up on Amazon and decided to order it. I am sure glad I did. For me, it brought all of the other ideas, concepts and practices together. Things like affirmations, burning desires, faith, action - they all are great, as long as they're operating in conjunction with the way you see yourself and want to see yourself. This book really stresses the importance of focusing on your self-image, which is something I've found many of the other works glossed over or lacked. It's a good work, laced with some biblical references which aren't overwhelming. If you can spend the money on it, it is certainly a great addition to your library.

Once you read this you will realize how many recent best sellers just regurgitate knowledge and wisdom that was already available 50 years to centuries ago, now for the sake of making a buck.

This was recommended to me back in 1976 when I was 19, has made all the difference in the world, has also made a profound difference to everyone I have ever suggested this to and helped through crisis (and still do now, 2016.) When everyone is running around with their heads cut off you'll be the calm one wondering what the fuss is all about... able to maintain perspective and focused on what's important and needs to be done personally and professionally when either or both worlds seem to be falling in on you... I've more than survived brain damage (more than once) , divorce, career ending disability, cancer, premature death of those closest to me.. things I never expected... and can say that which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger if you happen to have the right set of coping skills in your bag of tricks.

Brian Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Funny name. Great book!," “Creative striving for a goal that is important to you as a result of your own deep felt needs, aspirations and talents (and not the symbols which the ‘Joneses’ expect you to display) brings happiness as well as success because you will be functioning as you were meant to function. Man is by nature a goal-striving being. And because man is ‘built that way’ he is not happy unless he is functioning the way he was made to function—as a goal-striver. Thus true success and true happiness not only go together but each enhances the other.”

“Every human being has been literally ‘engineered for success’ by his Creator. Every human being has access to a power greater than himself.”

~ Maxwell Maltz from Psycho-Cybernetics

Psycho-Cybernetics. Funny name.

Great book! Maxwell Maltz was a world-renowned plastic surgeon who discovered that, while some people’s lives changed dramatically after he altered their appearance through plastic surgery, some people’s lives *didn’t*. He deduced that the primary factor that differentiated these groups was their self-image—not what they saw in the mirror but the images they had of themselves in their MINDS. Cool stuff.

He spent the second half of his career merging this self-image psychology with the then-popular science of “cybernetics”—which studies how things like guided missiles or “servo-mechanisms” hit their targets through a clear goal and constant adjustment of their course.

Here are some of the Big Ideas:

1. Cybernetics - Servo-mechanisms & you.
2. The Success Instinct - We’ve all got it!
3. Imagination - The first key.
4. Dehypnotize Yourself! - Starting now. :)
5. Rational Thought - How to use it.

Here’s to getting our Psycho-Cybernetic on as we set inspired goals, imagine our ideals, take action as we correct inevitable mistakes and practice FEELING our success. :)

The reasons for my obstacles finally dawned upon me through the wise words of Bob Proctor, as he mentioned the self image. He recommended a book on it, by Maxwell Maltz.

If it's losing that weight for real, or getting that confidence, or daring to do amazing & out of the comfort zone things, then as mentioned THIS IS FOR YOU!

This book has already started to help me immensely turn my brain and thoughts into an asset instead of it being a battlefield of negative thoughts and having the self image of myself as being unworthy and not believing in myself.

I remember reading reviews for this book only 2 months ago and trying to convince myself not to take the plunge despite all of the people saying this book changed their life.

Well...it was one of the best decisions I have made. And i confidently know I will use the practices in this book for the rest of my life to be a happy, confident, and strong goal-attacking person. Dr. Maltz's guidance is already starting to ring in my head almost daily.

I value the mental benefits of this book in the thousands honestly.

WWF,1.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Salesmen and sports,"This Dan Kennedy revision of Maxwell Maltz's original Pscyho-cybernetics is in my opinion so geared towards salesmen and sports that if you're not a salesman, athlete, sports fan or an avid golfer, the text can be hard to get through. Sadly, Maltz's original version of Psycho-cybernetics is not offered as a Kindle book, which is why I bought this one.
Maltz's original, which I read as a teenager in the 70s, also featured athletes and salespeople, but Maltz was more inclusive in his approach. This new version should be entitled something like ""Psycho-cybernetics for Salesmen and Sports."" Salesmen and sports are great and important, but potential readers should at least be given some indication that Kennedy has taken Maltz's book so heavily in that direction so that they can decide whether or not it's really for them.",13
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Top 10 of all time.,"This is one of those few books that put forth a new idea that has not only stood the test of time but has been woven into the fabric of the entire self development industry. It's up there with ""Think and Grow Rich"" and "" How to win friends and influence people"".

It starts slow and after 2 or 3 chapters I was beginning to question the purchase. ""There is nothing to DO"" I thought. Then after it got going I felt there was TOO MUCH to do. Lots of excersises.

Of course, like so many things, the crux is in the application. Will you use it?

I think the thing I liked best is that you can really hear Dr Maltzs' passion for humanity and sincere desire to help. He seems like a wonderful man.

Also that he isn't in the pie-in-the-sky ""anyone can do anything"" camp. He teaches us to be truthful about our actual limitations, which do have limits, but are far above what most people do or even aspire to.

I put this on a short Must Read list of a handful of classics and consider it a must for anyone pursuing their full potential.

I bough this book for less than 10 dollars and I must say, this is one of the best investments I have ever made. Easy to read, this book's ideas MAKE SENSE and are profound. I'd like to save my biggest reviews for one chapter only: Unlock your personality. I read this chapter at time when I was depressed, because I didn't get along with people too well. I was reserved, shy and was a social dud. My entire college years, I've been a social dud. My social life sucked. It sucked because I didn't know how to get along with people - I was irritable with people and might have appeared mean to many. The chapter: Unlock your personality might have changed my life. To follow the chapter and its advices precisely requires faith in yourself. A great leap indeed. Don't think, says the late Dr. Maltz -and act. Thinking only complicates things further. Don't think, don't over analyze yourself and just BE. It might as well be a magic bullet. It was for me, I think. Read that chapter over, and over, and over and it will eventually click. Be yourself is the message - and don't think. In social situations, don't think - and just be. Just be. Read the chapter, and you will understand what I mean. ;)",14

Guillermo Velez,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Worth the try for the cost,"Facts: It rook me months to do a decent job to relax and use the techniques described in the book. More than one reading and reading into details were necessary for me to grasp the right way to visualize what I wanted. The essentials of the book probably could me summarized in one chapter but the book includes a lot of examples, typical of this type of books. I did not achieve much the first couple of months on my first goal of reach my ideal weight. Then, my wife got me into a weight loss program and now I am well on my way to reach my goal. I keep doing the relaxation and visualization of reaching my ideal weight.

Opinion: I seek for a way to ""program"" the subconscious for a long time and this is the closest thing I have found. I started with a goal and the right tool just came along and I do not believe in coincidences. The weight loss program is making me loss weight. The techniques described in the book makes me follow the program with a very high level of discipline. The desire to reach my target weight is so high that I am able to sort almost all challenges I face to deviate from the weight loss program. I think that for the cost of the book is worth the try if you believe that you are a person of habit, that you behavior is ruled by your subconscious and you need to program that subconscious mind to change your behavior and achieve your goal",1

I want to thank Mr. Maltz for this book, and express my regret that I did not find it when I was like, 12.

I knew it was a good book the minute I read ""You are not inferior. You are not superior. You are YOU"". I knew it was a good book when I read about how Maltz dismisses obtaining positive self image through ""willpower"". How many of you have heard well-meaning friends and coworkers say ""think positive"" about something that troubles you? How many of you have wondered why this well-meaning advice seldom helps? Maltz hits the nail on the head when he tells, and illustrates, why willpower and forcing positive thoughts into your head does not work. AND....he specifically tells you how to change your thought process so the positive thoughts come naturally. He gives you simple (but important) exercises to help you obtain and use the concepts he teaches.

I am a firm believe that once you have a positive image, life seems to turn out better. Not only does it look better through clear (instead of mud-shaded) glasses....but your new found self image will help you get the things you want. It will give you the power to go after what you want because you finally feel worthy. Instead of brainwashings and piecemeal advice, Maltz lays a solid groundwork using pure logic as to why YOU are worthy, and how you can convince yourself of this fact. He even gives concrete visuals to aid his lessons (healing emotional scars, much like facial scars). Emotional facelift.

This man is a genius. Do yourself a huge favor, buy this book and read it. Then read it again.",5

The sooner in life you can get these perspectives, the better for you and your loved ones. The theme in each chapter tends to develop somewhat slowly. Maltz tends to gather various points, from many different authors and sources, and takes some pages so that they coalesce into very significant and meaningful approaches to life that have immense practical value. And this is a workbook, meant to be used as a guide for your own personal work, which we all need to do very much of.

I personally found much of the material to be ... not dense ... but dry. I hate to say that because Maltz is clearly such an intelligent man with an important message and helpful advice. But, it is true, in my opinion.

J,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,one of the most powerful books you will ever read,"honestly, quit wasting your money on cheesy current generation self help books like ""the secret"" or ""the power of now"". i'm only 26 and this book has helped me profoundly, increased my levels of happiness, self confidence, pretty much curbed my general anxiety levels, and has me looking at life from a whole new perspective. the author maxwell maltz wrote a book like this from the bottom of his heart, and you feel how contagious it is coming off the pages. i also have it on audiobook and listen to it going to and from work. it makes a difference trust me, because i NEVER write book reviews on amazon. i've only read it three times in the past month since i've had it and am now reading ""zero resistance selling"" by the same author and will also be purchasing ""zero resistance living"", the 90 day program, from the psycho-cybernetics.com site. if you want to understand why you act the way you do, why you perceive yourself the way you do, how you can gradually change that and KEEP it that way, and have plenty of aha moments about yourself, get this book. don't misunderstand, you will have to put in the work like anything else in life, but you WILL end up recommending it to everyone you know after you read it, believe me. my mom and my brother have now both read it and have both wondered why they didn't stumble upon this sooner, and they are practically non-readers. you are worth it, get on this already.",5

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Still A Great Book,"I originally read this as a condensed book in Reader's Digest magazine back in the early 1960's, and then bought the book itself. After several moves, it was lost. I recently repurchased it due to it's past impact on my thinking. A primary point that the late Dr. Maltz emphasized was his observation that plastic surgery had unexpected results with different people. For some, a minor correction caused a major personality change for the better. For others, even where the cosmetic change was more pronounced, the person's personality changed little, if at all. He attributed this to the person's innner / self image. Another key point was the power of visualization, that, if vivid / realistic enough, can have the same effect on the brain as if actually seeing / doing, a point now used regularly in sports training, et al. Both these points and others helped me immensely through my teen years and into early adulthood to break out of my ""shell"", and minimize the tendency to prejudge outcomes or approach change / the unknown negatively. The fact that his book continues to sell, and that there are several spin-offs, is testimony to the timelessness of these points.",4

Shantel Ruiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Straight Shooter,"In an effort to understand why I have a strong tendency to ""doubt"" myself in many situations where I rationally know I excel, I bought this book and read it cover to cover.
I found the author Dr. Maltz to be incredibly insightful and the no nonsense way he delivered the information was rather refreshing. I've read my fair share of ""self help"" books and I can honestly
say that most of them carry on a lot about psychological mumbo jumbo, but NOT this one! Dr Maltz is a serious straight shooter and he really just says it like it is. I found many of the ideas he presented to cause ""ah ha"" moments inside me and the information is also very relevant, even in todays world which at first I thought might be an issue since this book was written many years ago. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a way to better understand their self-image and in essence make it better.
By far my favorite part of the book is the idea he delivers that we don't need to dredge up our past and relive it and ""figure it out"" in order to get over it. He just basically says, forget it, and move on! I LOVED THAT!! It makes me feel free from past baggage that I thought may have been holding me back. Really a great book!

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Best book for self development I've found,"I have been studying psychology for the past 3 years at least, and have delved into topics such as NLP, hypnosis, destructive patterns etc. I have studied each of these topics and more in great depth and detail, and have to say that this book is by far the most treasured possession I own. This book is what I consider to be the answer, the key to all of self development. If you want to accomplish ANYTHING and you are not, there is a reason for it, and this book can help you. If you will read it, and then re-read it, and then re-read it, until you begin to fully understand and comprehend the principles and concepts presented, it will change your life....dramatically.

The book's whole premise is that we all behave not according to how things actually are, but how we perceive them to be. As a result of this, our beliefs can be very skewed, and thus our behavior will be as well. It is the task of this book to teach and instruct the reader in how to recognize irrational beliefs, use rational conscious thought to determine what they want to believe instead, and then use principles such as ""theater in the mind"" and ""acting as if"" to create a new reality experienced by your mind, which will program your self image, and thus create a new objective reality around you.

My personal opinion is that this book contains the key, the solution to any problem you are currently having, which you want to change but don't know how to, or are unsure of where to start. I highly recommend it.",8
Gadgeteer,4.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,"Written decades ago, but still pertinent","Dr. Maltz, originally a face surgeon, came to recognize in his patients a need for a positive self image, which need transcended the physical characteristics that patients wanted improved.

He compares the methodology of achieving a desired improvement in one's self image with that used in the design of modern physical automatic control systems (he uses the term ""Cybernetics"" to describe the servomechanism systems of his day, such as those used in military fire control systems).

The concept is imaginative, and Dr. Maltz uses most of his book to describe various methods for helping change one's self image to the one that is desired, presumably by using negative feedback control to minimize the difference between one's current self image and one's desired self image, similar in concept to how military fire control systems operate.

While the basic ideas presented by Dr. Maltz are intriguing the human brain is so much more complex than the design of a military fire control system that the basic concepts presented must be taken with this important limitation in mind.

The fact that book is still in print after many decades and has sold many millions of copies, however, is a tribute to some validity of Dr. Maltz's basic concepts.",3

I would definitely recommend this one, because although Dan Kennedy means well, the updated version just has too much stuff in it, and it's easy to lose sight of the forest for all the trees, so to speak. This book has all the nuts and bolts of psycho cybernetics in it, and you won't need another one if you really study and read it.
If you're really trying to change your life, or a certain habit, or any other kind of personal change, this is the book for you. It's the science of how the mind works - and it's more fundamental than anything by Tony Robbins, The Secret, Hypnosis, and NLP.

Reggie,4.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Nothing psycho about ths book,"Not for the novice reader. Psycho-Cybernetics: A new technique for using your subconscious power should not be read in one sitting. You should take time to absorb and personally relate to every page. Do not expect to accept or even understand the subconsciously presented concepts of the human mind. Your first impression of the book will not be your last and most likely it will not even be correct. Share this book with a friend or better yet buy a second book.

Sharon Delarose,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Maltz exposes the true power of the mind,"Everything is possible if you believe... the power of the mind is incredible. Amaze yourself. We are capable of so much more than we are taught to believe. If only they taught this in school. This is what we should be teaching our kids. Psychocybernetics doesn't teach you what to think, but HOW to think in such a way that your entire life will be transformed. Improve yourself in any area, sports, your job, your love life, simply by readjusting your approach to the world. Maxwell Maltz exposes the secrets of how powerful our thoughts are. And he offers scientific proof to back it up. Maxwell Maltz tells it better than most anybody else I've read.

I first encountered this book back in the early 80's. I didn't know it then but my life was being transformed into something pretty amazing and this was one of the books that helped me change the entire course of my life.

Phil Saparov,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Life-changing read,"I used the advice presented in this book to bring about major change with great results at least twice.
First, when I sprained my knee and tore my ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament), I used the concept of striving towards a goal and thinking of my physical body as a servo-mechanism to heal myself. Where I got the method of healing is a whole 'nother story. But the concept of driving yourself towards an image of Health instead of trying to get away from disease really helped.

It no longer mattered what exactly was wrong with my knee - whether it was a partial or complete tear, or whether one or two menisci had been torn, and to which degree. The idea was to focus on the solution instead of the problem. It took me about 3 months to get back to living a normal life, where I could dance, run, and even do heavy squats again.

The second time I used this concept was when I had completely exhausted my system as a result of emotionally and physically draining work that I had been doing for a long time and for too many hours per week. At some point, all of a sudden, I got a whole host of physical and emotional problems, the worst of which was a pretty severe case of depression.

I changed my job, and went in for different therapies, some of which helped to a degree. But I attribute most of the success, especially in the emotional part, to Psychocybernetics. You see, different therapists analyzed my condition and tried to heal each of the causes that might have had an ill effect on me. This made me focus too much on the causes, which were the problem, instead of focusing on the solution.

Once again, I armed myself with Psychocybernetics and went to work. It took me about 3-4 months to feel almost 100% again. But the most important thing that I remember was that as soon I started to focus on the image of health and think about all the things I would do as soon as I was better, that's when my healing really took off.

Buy it. Use it.
Best,

Phil Saparov",13

on conscious methods of re-programming yourself, not on any kind of self-hypnosis.

I've only been using this method a couple of months, but it is nicer. Some hypnotists recommended to me that I get an older edition of this book, one that has not been messed with by any other additional authors, so I got this one.
It takes time to learn, and even be aware of the negative messages you give yourself, but it's worth it to do it all consciously until it all becomes second nature. I'm still working on it. This book is way better than anything Dale Carnegie ever wrote about positive thinking.",1

Definitely not a once read and put on the shelf. It has a lot to offer anyone who studies it. Reading it once, unless you have a photographic memory, just will not do it for you at all. A must study for improvement of self, motivation, goals and just plain being better at what you want to be. Even use the information and lessons learned on children, co-workers, friends, relatives and everyone you come in contact with (in a positive not manipulative manner). This is the kind of book that you review often to improve all those relationships you have--especially with yourself. Just get the book and study study study.!!

I wish they had taught me these life lessons in school when growing up. I think understanding our minds and ourselves to build a happier future is more useful than math. The beginning was so revolutionary that I expected the rest of the book to just reiterate these findings. I thought the first chapters had so many new insights that there was no way there could be more. I was wrong. I wonder how Maxwell Maltz was able to learn so much about the human mind. Each chapter is a pleasant surprise. I plan on reading it over every year.,1

Martin Zakostelsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Classic masterpiece still shining,"After reading quite a few self-help and self-examination books, this is the book I was waiting for. Although at first I was quite skeptical because of the age of the book (I though ""Would there be something new for me, would the ideas be still valid?""), after first several pages doubts dissolved and I was entirely caught.

I believe all the reviews have said already enough, so I'll keep my review short. This book has all that I want from it:
- Down-to-earth style without exaggerations. Yet very strong and moving content, explaining how human brain works, what brings us happiness/more life, and how to achieve it.
- Positive :o). Gives reader so much energy into his life.
- No easy-read. Should be read definitely more times than once.

Simply put, this is a must read in the area of self-help/psychology books.

Some of favorite quotes:

""The self-image is changed, for better or worse, not by intellect alone, nor by intellectual knowledge alone, but by ""experiencing."" Wittingly or unwittingly you developed your self-image by your creative experiencing in the past. You can change it by the same method. "" (page x)
""One of the most pleasant thoughts to any human being is the thought that he is needed, that he is important enough to help and add to the happiness of some other human being."" (page 97)

""Since man is a goal striving being, he is functioning naturally and normally when he is oriented toward some positive goal and striving toward some desirable goal. Happiness is a symptom of normal, natural functioning and when man is functioning as a goal-striver, he tends to feel fairly happy, regardless of circumstances."" (page 101)

""Our habits are not accidental, or happenstance. We have them because they fit us. They are consistent with our self-image and our entire personality pattern. When we consciously and deliberately develop new and better habits, our self-image tends to outgrow the old habits and grow into the new pattern. "" (page 108)

""To give the other person credit for being sincere, if mistaken, rather than willful and malicious, can do much to smooth out human relations and bring about better understanding between people. Ask yourself, ""How does this appear--to him?"" ""How does he interpret this situation?"" ""How does he feel about it?"" Try to understand why he might ""act the way he does."""" (page 115)

""Man maintains his balance, poise, and sense of security only as he is moving forward--or seeking. When you think of yourself as having attained the goal, you become static, and you lose the security and equilibrium you had when you were moving towards something. The man who is convinced that he is ""good"" in the absolute sense, not only has no incentive to do better, but he feels insecure because he must defend the sham and pretense."" (page 137)

""Regardless of your feelings, force yourself to mix and mingle with other people. After the first cold plunge, you will find yourself warming up and enjoying it if you persist. Develop some social skill that will add to the happiness of other people: dancing, bridge, playing the piano, tennis, conversation. It is an old psychological axiom that constant exposure to the object of fear immunizes against the fear. As the lonely person continues to force himself into social relations with other human beings--not in a passive way, but as an active contributor--he will gradually find that most people are friendly, and that he is accepted. His shyness and timidity begin to disappear. He feels more comfortable in the presence of other people and with himself. The experience of their acceptance of him enables him to accept himself."" (page 139)

""If responding and reacting to negative feedback does not take us further down the road to our own goal--or serve our ends, then there is no need to respond at all. And, if response of any kind gets us off course, or works against us--then no response is the appropriate response."" (page 199)

""If life adapts itself in so many varied forms to act as a means toward an end, is it not reasonable to assume that if we place ourselves in the sort of goal-situation where more life is needed, that we will receive more life?"" (page 261)",7

Just put your doubts aside and BUY THIS BOOK today.
Right now while you are thinking about it. The sooner you get it, the sooner you will benefit from its simple effective techniques.
Whatever you do, don't put it off for tomorrow. You know you will just forget about it and then it will be a MAJOR OPPORTUNITY LOST.
Just make the simple effort right now to order a copy and you will be buying a lotto ticket that is virtually certain to PAY OFF BIG for you.
It costs [very little money] and if applied even a little bit, it is likely to change your life. How many other things that cost [this little] can you say that about.
The original edition DID change MY life about 10 years ago and I know at least 5 other people who point to this book (and another classic-Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill) as major keys to their personal philosophy and success in life.
This revised edition is even better than the original due to the care put into it by Dan Kennedy, who is keeping Dr. Maltz's work alive for the present generation with this timely update.
I liked it so much I have bought 5 more copies for some great business associates as gifts.

Put the techniques that have made many ordinary people appear to be extraordinary to work for you. You don't have to work harder, you just need to apply these amazing principals to your current methods and your will be so much more effective.
I also highly recommended ""Zero Resistance Selling"" for sales persons as a companion to this book which specializes the same techniques to Sales careers.",9

I can honestly say that I think this book has ended my search for the ""perfect"" self-help book.
After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to buy this book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I've had the book for one week now and I am already seeing results.
About 3 years ago I entered into the world of sales and all of a sudden I became painfully aware of my self-image or my self-esteem as others call it. I became very self-conscious and started down a slippery slope into the world of negative thinking and emotions that weren't helping me at all.
So I did what any person would do who wants to overcome their limiting beliefs and learn how to overcome negative thinking and I started buying self-help litereature. my library is chocked full of books from all the greats. Well I learned something from all the books that I read, but I just felt there was always something missing. I didn't feel like I had the information that I needed to really turn it all around. I tried ""Affirmations"" etc. with marginal results.
Then I found this book. Maxwell talks about how we act, feel and perform is in direct relation to how we imagine ourselves to be. You may need to read that last sentence again because it's what helped me to start putting it all together. He then gives techniques for changing your self-image and overcoming your negative thinking that really works.
I'm very grateful to Maxwell for writing this book. He really put his heart into it and made a masterpiece!
Please don't make the mistake of not buying this book. It could well be the best money you ever spent! God Bless!",21

There are stories and additional paragraphs of information that you're not quite sure what to do with and it clouds the original ideas.

LindaT,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,A Good Thing Made Even Better,"I heard about the first PSYCHO CYBERNETICS book in the 60's (yes, I am over 21 years old) and when I read it I thought it was wonderful. In fact, I thought that if I only would be able to have one self-help book, it would be this one.
THE NEW PSYCHO CYBERNETICS has taken a good book and made it even better. The masterful editing and adapting by Dan Kennedy is great. It still is done in the voice of the original author, Dr. Maxwell Maltz, but it has up to date examples of people most of us know from this time in history, yet it still includes the examples Dr. Maltz wrote about in his original book.
The theme hasn't changed -- Dr. Maltz claimed that the human mind has a ""servo-mechanism"" which can help us accomplish what we desire, but we must let it do its work once the desire is ""fed into"" the mind. He drew upon his knowledge of the then fledgling work of computers. And now in the 21st century, computers have advanced in an unbelievable manner, and yet the principle behind which they work is still the same; the goal-striving mechanism which works towards its teleological end by negative feedback, correction, and positive feedback.
I have other self help books, but for me, this one is the basis on which all the others are carried out.
I can't recommend it highly enough.",23

This book is a modern treatment of Maltz's original book and has made it even more palatable and applicable in daily life. The exercises are simple, straightforward and effective. One just needs to practice.
You're not reading this book to be enlightened to salvation or something (which you can read the Holy Bible for!) but rather, this book prepares your mind to set goals in the daily routine of life. It is about setting goals, and consciously thinking how you could achieve them, letting your subconscious autopilot ""servo-mechanism"" help you on the way there through deliberate practical exercises. This book is even more readable than the original.

Ramon Acosta,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,The first and foremost,"Without a doubt, Dr. Maltz' classic is still on top of the heap of self-help books, tapes and seminars available. Everything that was relevant in late 1950 and early 1960 is still relevant today. Unless humans fundamentally change the way the brain operates, this book will be a classic text on the process of communicating with and reprogramming the inner self.

There's only one downside about this book. If you don't try the mental techniques, nothing will change. You might manufacture a new line of thinking after absorbing the material, but if you don't practice and apply it on a near daily basis, then you've merely read one of the greatest psychology texts of all time. A bit of mental elbow grease will instead allow you to experience this book and the profound change you and your loved ones can all potentially benefit from.",7

Rubin Wald,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Great Update of a Classic!,"Dan Kennedy has done a brilliant job of giving Dr. Maltz's classic text a contemporary feel while remaining true to the original version.
I still have my 1974 Pocket Book edition of Psycho-Cybernetics and its ideas and insights helped me a lot in understanding life and success and how I could control my own destiny.
This updated version is even better! I especially liked the PRESCRIPTION and MENTAL TRAINING EXERCISE boxes that Mr. Kennedy has strategically placed throughout the book. They contain very clear suggestions and practical exercises for living an abundant and fulfilling life. For example, he prescribes keeping a ""success diary"" as a tool for building a stronger self-image. And on page 201, there is an powerful exercise for developing the all important habit of forgiveness.
One of the insights Dr. Maltz gave me that helped clarify my own life journey was his understanding that our unconscious minds cannot distinguish between a real experience and the same experience vividly imagined. Years later I found confirmation for this idea in Quantum Physics.
Nobel Prize winning Physicist Niels Bohr's Complementarity Principle shows us that the mental aspect of an imagined experience is complementary to its physical aspect. Both are equally 'real'. No wonder imagination and visualization are such valuable skills to master for anyone who wants to transform their dreams into physcial reality.
I wonder if Dr. Maltz and Dr. Bohr ever had a conversation!
Dan Kennedy has done a tremendous favor for anyone who wants knowledge and practical applications for being more successful. I applaud his efforts.",38

I am proud to say this is the first book that I have completed all the way through in over a year. I bought this book back in 2009 when I was fighting the boredom in Iraq and remember only reading a few chapters. After I learned that it was a recommended reading by some of the leaders in Empower Network, I decided to dust it off and see how the top earners have used this book to unlock their success mechanisms and start living a more fulfilling life.

And boy, I'm glad I did!

This powerful book has provided so much value to my life. I now know the power of imagination and have started to imagine successful outcomes when going through a sales presentation, public speaking presentations, and any areas of my life that I'm not completely comfortable and confident in.

And let me tell you the concepts in Psycho Cybernetics works!

I've had my best month in personal training sales at the gym with over $3,000 in sales in just the first 3 weeks. One sale worth $1,950. My previous best was $1,800 for the full month.

A User,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Better Than the Original; Max Would Have Been Proud,"Greetings:
Join us at the Psycho-Cybernetics discussion group on [...]
To date, I have bought three hardcover editions of the New Psycho-Cybernetics (NPC): one I gave to a friend, one I take with me to read during the day, and one I keep in my home office to work with on those days when I work at home. I have found it a significant improvement upon the original. (I have used up three paperback versions of the original over the last 10 years.)
I remember when I first read the original version of PC, in around 1990. I thought it was somewhat hokey. I used to be an engineer, and I thought it somewhat strange to try to apply feedback control systems theory to people. We are not machines, after all.
The strange thing, though, was that the system worked for me. Still, I was somewhat embarrassed about the whole thing, so I sort of kept my dabbling to myself.
Then, in the mid-late nineties, I read Fritjof Capra's book, The Web of Life. In that book, Capra talks a lot about systems theory, and he also goes into the history of the original cybernetics group (not Psycho cybernetics, but rather a group of mathematicians, psychologists, biologists, and physicists who collaborated in WWII to create anti-aircraft guns that could effectively track and destroy enemy aircraft). In his discussion, Capra explains that the original cybernetics group's goal was to try to make machines that could do what people and animals do naturally and easily, without conscious thought. They tried to do this, in part, by observing the actions of animals and people. Based on such observation, the group devised the early foundation of what became our modern science of systems control as used in almost every modern electrical/mechanical system.
What Maltz tried to do was take a bit of the science and art of systems control and apply it back to people, in an attempt to improve their functioning. I think one of the original cyberneticists, Norbert Weiner, also tried to do this in his book, The Human Use of Human Beings, but I could be wrong.
Anyway, because Psycho-Cybernetics is based on systems theory, in contrast to other types of ""self help"" or positive thinking books, it recognizes that a person trying to achieve her goals is going to fail, and miss what she is pursuing, probably many times on her way to her destination. Rather than candy coating this fact and suggesting ""positive thinking,"" PC suggests feedback control system oriented techniques to use, deal with, and not be completely stymied by such failures.
It also provides techniques to help one deal with ""drama queen"" co-workers and supervisors who seem to go out of their way to provide damaging negative feedback (e.g., ignoring negative feedback in ch. 11, ""How to Unlock Your Real Personality""), or retarding how fast responds to negative feed back (e.g., delaying the response, as in ch. 12 ""Do It Yourself Tranquilizers that Bring Peace of Mind."").

Now, on to the new version of PC: my own opinion is that it is better than the original. Dan follows the original structure of the PC book, and much of the text is in common. However, Dan has buttressed that text with additional examples taken from the many hours of recordings and reams of Maltz' notes that Dan owns. In addition, Dan also provides many practical examples of the successful application of PC techniques that have arisen since the original version of the book was published in 1960.
Try NPC. If, like me, you have areas in your life where you would like to do better, I think you will find it useful.",48

It's apparent that this book was written before drugs were prevelant in our society because there's no outlandish statements, no grey area, and it's actually down to earth and makes sense. If you lack confidence, or have a low self opion, this is by far the best self help book available...buy it.",11

It's certainly a book that need to be read several times and use as a manual.,1

I do so regularly; but not this one. I read it on a very strong recommendation and found it to be the real thing, at least for me. Written by a plastic surgeon who realized altering someone's appearance did not alter their self image, he wrote a book to teach you how to think and use your brain and it works.",1
Moin Ahmed Sheikh,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Will help you see things in a whole new perspective,This book was recommended by a mentor ... well worth the read. It will help you see things in a whole new perspective. Its amazing how our minds work and why some people never reach their full potential. Get this book it will change your life and the way you think. You want to change your life start working on changing the way you think.,1
Susil Manchanayaka,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Understand Yourself,"I bought this book and read it. It is interesting for many reasons. I am a lover of books and I am married to books (metaphorically). Why I say that this book is interesting is that it is life changing. The few dollars I spent on this book is worth and I learnt a lot by reading this book. The chapters are shorter and easy to grasp. Some ideas may be unfamiliar to a novice reader but if you are an experienced and an avid reader, you can get at the gist of the book.

Many people have complexes (psychological) and they struggle to come out of the shell they live in. This book helps you to see the world as it is and you can transform your life with ideas from the book. The ideas in the book are worth remembering and practicing. If you are into understanding the nature of human mentality, behavior and why people do certain things but why they are afraid of doing certain things is interesting. In our lives we undergo numerous pains and we sometimes become depressed and helpless. This book helps anyone to see the world as it is.

The writer is an experienced professional in his field and particularly this book helps one to be motivated, enthusiastic in anything she does and develop confidence. He is a leading scholar and a much respected counselor. I read about his biography on the net and I was very impressed. He is an authority on his subject. I can say that this book is a booster - it boosts your performance. It is light reading.

Maltz takes the reader into an unexplored area of human mentality, how to overcome fears, the basis of fear and personal development. He helps the reader overcome fears. He argues that most of the fears we have are all baseless and unscientific. Fears come out of ignorance. Fears come out of wrong perceptions we have. Fears come out of not being exposed to the world we live in. That is what he says.

The book is pocket sized and you can carry it when you travel. It is like a handbook on personal development. If you have any interest in mentoring, counseling, public speaking or teaching, this is the next book you may consider reading.

I personally like the ideas in the book. The time you may spend will be worth the trouble you take to read this book. The chapters in it are short and run into a couple of pages and at a single sitting you can read a chapter. Make this book a partner in your life. It is worth buying and keeping in your private library. In life one may experience ups and downs. Tribulations in life are part of human existence on this planet. We seek advice from others, counselors, teachers or if you belong to a profession of respect - mentors. This book is a companion mentor. If you are in need of some expert advice, consult this book. Discuss what is in it. It will pay rich dividends.

The final verdict on the book is that it is a book of interesting ideas for us to be human. It is a book that teaches us how to face life. It is a book that teaches us live happily. It is a book that teaches us how to help others in need. My friends, read it. You will soon see a dramatic transformation in your life. It is life changing and mind changing. The contents of the book are to be digested (metaphorically). The ideas in the book by Maltz (the writer) will enlighten you all.

While it provides useful background and some updated examples, Kennedy weaves it in seemlessly into the old material. What you get is confusion. The first person of Kennedy is mixed in with the first person of Maltz, without being differentiated in any way! So in the same section, you have someone speaking of ""my patients"" in the '40's or '50's, and then the same voice speaking of ""my experiences"" with a Kevin Costner movie or a Michael Jordan anecdote. There is no change in typeface, or paragraph structure to indicate that different people are writing, one long-dead, the other alive and ""editing"" this book. Why didn't Kennedy's editor make him place his commentary separately?
This was enough to spoil most of the usefulness of this edition for me. I suggest noting the boxed exercises that Kennedy includes, which are useful, and then reading the original of the book.",53

Jon Torodash,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,A pioneer in the field still standing strong,"I don't make it a habit to read self-help books, but the off-color fitness guru Matt Furey has made a killing on selling a program based off of Maltz's work, and most other ""motivational speakers"" usually bend a knee in respect to Maltz as a forerunner. So I picked up a cheap used copy and read it cover to cover. The only question I have left is why anyone would bother with any of the other crap. This book effectively condenses the entirety of the self-help field. As far as I can tell, this is as good as it gets by the standards of the genre, is enjoyably accessible to a general audience, and has weathered time's attack on its relevance stunningly well.

Firstly, Maltz had the raw clinical experience necessary to write this kind of book. As a crackerjack plastic surgeon he saw immediately and firsthand the life-changing or life-stalling power of self-image at work in the faces of his patients. (And anyone who scoffs at unorthodox contributors to a research field ought to know that Albert Einstein was working for the Swiss patent office when he submitted the Theory of Special Relativity.) Yet Maltz also admits where exactly the limits of his knowledge lie rather than try to convince the reader of his omniscience.

Secondly, Maltz was receptive to many fundamental tenets of psychology and philosophy and works them into Psycho Cybernetics clearly and without contradiction. Nor does he try to repackage ancient metaphysical hokum with inane and feeble examples.

Thirdly, there are no workshops, special reports, live phone help, or products to buy. (Though I cannot speak for the organization that has cropped up around Maltz's name.) All pretense and exaggeration for marketing purposes seem absent from his book.

Maltz was definitive and unequivocal in his ideas, quick to set a standard and stick to it. He took seriously some very fundamental issues of life and makes clear statements. This book rises high above the haphazard pop philosophy/ethics smeared all over mass media which are either shallow and weak or imperiously stupid. Maltz simply faced the truth of his own convictions. Psycho Cybernetics by no means outlines life management skills as an exact science, but its frank suggestions are intellectually compelling. Overall, the book is worthwhile because Maltz' honest and non-condescending style at least earns your respect, if not your belief.",467

Unfortunately I bought it based on all the high reviews. I guess I missed something.

Each chapter seemed to ramble on and on. It is a lengthy book and it seems like a lot of the chapter content was redundant saying the same thing over. The book discusses one's self image, happiness, success and how to evaluate it in life.

The author has a section about SUCCESS (sense of direction, understanding, courage, charity, esteem, self confidence and self acceptance). However each of these bullet points were very basic principles. Same applies to his chapter on FAILURE (frustration, aggressiveness, insecurity, lonliness, uncertainty, resentment and emptiness). Again, very basic material.

For me the last third of the book was more boring than the other two-thirds. It was a hard book to finish being so uninteresting. I can't recommend this book.",6

Christian Rosenkreutz,1.0 out of 5 stars,The New Psycho-Cybernetics: The Original Science of Self-Improvement and Success That Has Changed the Lives of 30 Million People,Outdated psuedo-science,"I consider myself to be pretty open-minded, especially in regards to the potentials of the human mind, but this book actually reads like a laundry list of little ""fixes"" to do with your life, and reads more like a precursor to infomercial formats than to gaining any kind of insight whatsoever.

The author declares right away that he is not a psychologist, but considers himself qualified (and believe me, I am not a fan of the word ""qualified"" by any means) and continues to compare himself to Einstein, Madam Curie, Wright Brothers (should I have to mention all of their minds actually created advances that changes the entire world without question?) all in the preface, before you even get to the table of contents, which I will briefly list a few entries:

""your key to a better life""

""the success mechanism within you""

""first key to success mechanism""

""dehypnotize yourself""

""let your success mechanism work for you""

""habit of happiness""

""success-type personality""

""failure mechanism""

""how to give yourself an emotional facelift""

""do-it-yourself tranquilizers that bring peace of mind""

I won't go any further, although there are more. My problem is that not only is this self-proclaimed ""scientist/psychologist"" coining new terms, he does it in a very QVC way. I am all for understanding the programming we submit ourselves to, and ways to understand the mind, and patterns of thought, however this book is a waste of time, only for the mindless reader that in fact turns off their brain to read this book (the author actually asks you to do that while reading, its in one of the first chapters, right after he tries to convince the reader that ""telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition have been established by scientific laboratory experiments."" That is the actual sentence from page 24. I would be delighted by nothing more than to get ahold of these ""scientific laboratory experiments"" data records to see this for myself.

MereChristian,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,The Book That Re-Started the Expanded Universe,"After the original Star Wars films ended with the release of Return of the Jedi, the interest in the franchise waned, seeming to end with the cancellation of the Marvel run in 1986. There appeared to be no market anymore for stories set in the galaxy far, far away, but some at Lucasfilm disagreed, so they pitched an idea to their superiors for further Star Wars adventures. They argued that these new adventures should take the form of novels set in the time period after Return of the Jedi.

Once they received approval from George Lucas and the other higher-ups, they searched for a writer to pen this new trilogy, and decided to offer the contract for the trilogy to then-rising science-fiction writer Timothy Zahn. Thus, what would become known as The Thrawn Trilogy was born.

The first book, Heir to the Empire outsold the modest hopes that had been held out for the books, and much more. It was a run-away best-seller that proved that there was still a HUGE market for SW stories. Timothy Zahn went on to become, for many fans, the definitive author of the EU (Expanded Universe) of SW stories.

Twenty years after the initial release of Heir, Timothy Zahn released a special annotated version of the novel, with helpful notes, observations, and explanations from himself and (every once in a while) Betsy Mitchell, his editor at Random House.

Of course the story is terrific fun. It takes us five years after the end of Jedi, where the Rebel Alliance has made huge gains since their victory over the Emperor at the Battle of Endor. In those five years, the Rebellion have established a formal government (called the ""New Republic"" as a continuation of the Old Republic Palpatine ended in his Sith plot), pushed back the Imperials from many star systems, and reached a slight military superiority to the heavily-armed Imperial forces.

All of this success is threatened by a brilliant military commander, and last of the Imperial Grand Admirals, named Thrawn. For his own reasons, which are inscrutable (he seems to have no respect for the late Emperor and his ""New Order"") to all but himself, he believes the Empire must rise again and the ""Rebellion"" - he steadfastly refuses to call it the New Republic - must be destroyed. To this end, he has found an insane clone of an Old Republic era Jedi Master, Joruus C'baoth, and is using him to perform carefully-planned attacks to drive the Republic to it's knees.

What's more, he has agreed to the madman clone's price for his help: Leia Organa Solo and her and Han's twin children she is pregnant with, to be kidnapped and handed over to C'baoth.

So began the resurgence in the now truly massive Star Wars franchise. The plot is interesting, but what made this work truly compelling are the characters. Along with the favorites from the movies (such as Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, Lando, so on), you have new characters to enjoy. You find yourself both cheering for and against the bad guys, for instance. This is because, though Thrawn is more polished and refined than the Emperor and Vader, is a genius to boot, and has some good motives for some of his actions, there is little doubt that he is still evil. After all, he is fine with killing incompetent subordinates, kidnapping innocents and handing them over to a homicidal maniac, among other lovely things. There is also no doubt that, though insane, C'baoth is the every bit the clone of his template, one of the more powerful pre-Empire Jedi. All in all, this is quite a challenge for the heroes.

Part of the difficulty for the good guys is that Thrawn is careful and smart. He analyzes his enemies, unlike the Emperor and Vader he will retreat from a fight he can't win, and he plans his strategies so that, even when he does lose, he still either gets something, hurts the Republic, or both.

One area that Zahn deserves both praise and some slight critique (but mostly praise) is in the area of how ""hard"" his SW books are. In science-fiction circles, there is a scale of ""hardness"" and ""softness"" in regards to the genre. For instance, how much does the story adhere to scientific fact (hard), or just use science jargon or vague ideas to give a template or justification for story elements (soft). Zahn was limited in how much ""hardness"" he could put in the Star Wars books due to the fantastical nature of the series. He still tried. Sometimes this could pull you out of the fantastical elements due to the explanations, which obviously was not a good thing. All in all, this is a tiny criticism, because his keeping the characters grounded made the story more compelling and believable than the truly ridiculous paths many other authors have taken stories down since then. While he is a bit long on explanations and science at times, his grounded approach really has been shown to be for the best.

This novel also introduced three characters that would go on to influence future books, and be wildly popular with fans, despite not appearing in any of the films. Said characters are Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, and Imperial Captain Gilad Pellaeon. It's a testament to the story-telling and world-building skills of Tim Zahn that he was able to create characters that consistently are fan-favorites, even sometimes over movie characters.

Of course, this edition of Heir being annotated offers added goodies. As I already stated, there are numerous notes from Zahn and Mitchell about the process of writing the trilogy. These tidbits open a window to the reader about how the tales developed, including what ideas were accepted, rejected, or fine-tuned by the folks at Lucasfilm. To get into the heads of Zahn and Mitchell in some ways helped to almost complete the book, as some questions fans have had about Heir and the rest of The Thrawn Trilogy are answered in the notes.

For the Star Wars fan, and really science-fiction fans in general, this is a must-read.

Highly Recommended.",8
Andrew P. Catton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Heir to the Franchise,"Much has been said about ""Heir to the Empire"" in its 20+ years as a story. I can't help but agree with the positive and amazing statements made by so many. 'Heir' is fun, exciting, original and nostalgic. The characters from the original STAR WARS trilogy are written well, and their advances seem very natural for a story set 5 years after RETURN OF THE JEDI. It wasn't like destroying the Death Star just made everything great for the galaxy- there is political, commercial and personal strife in the New Republic as well as an Empire that just won't give up. A new villain, now iconic in the Expanded Universe, written wonderfully with elitism and menace, presents a threat to our heroes as they struggle to face new challenges and new allies as well.

What was also really fun was seeing the way this book, essentially the first EU novel after 1978's ""Splinter of the Mind's Eye"", captured the lingo and feel of STAR WARS with phrases like, ""landing cycle"" for Luke's X-Wing and easily integrated references back to the films. Luke's return to the Dark Side cave on Dagobah and his horrific vision of an alternate, failed assault on Jabba's sail barge is another example of author Timothy Zahn's skill in delving into the feel we already know and then progressing the story.

The pacing of the story is quick and full of twists. I found myself greatly enjoying the leaps in prose that kept the energy up. Amid the fast adventure, however, is a deep and calculated evil, rooted in the novel's portrayal of the new Imperial enemy. You can feel the dark and seething plotting and how easily this new baddie would fit within the film series.

A romp with something for all of the main characters to do, ""Heir to the Empire"" reinvigorated the STAR WARS franchise in the years leading up to the release of the prequel films. This 20th anniversary release includes annotations reflecting on the development of the story, its connection to other works, and modern looks at ideas that were fresh in 1991. These are insightful and fun, giving a connection to Timothy Zahn along the way that almost feels as if you are sitting with him and reading the story. This is a must-read for STAR WARS fans!",4
DOS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Five Stars + a Small Criticism,"I agree with the most essential elements of the many five star reviews. It was a delight to be reacquainted with the Star Wars family. Mr. Zahn is an excellent story teller, but he has one habit which just irks me; and that is he often uses the construct of ""the other"" rather than a character's name or a pronoun. The good news is that this small writing flaw (as I believe it is) can be easily corrected by a global word search of ""the other"" and substituted with a name or ""she"", ""he"", ""him"", ""her"" , or ""it"" as appropriate by the writer or an editor. Indeed, it seems that an editor should have attended to this.",2
DJRP,4.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,A great read with some interesting notes from the author.,"This is a great entry into the Star Wars extended universe. It's an early book, originally printed in the early 90s so you'll probably notice some inconsistencies with the movie canon established in the prequels. Despite that though, Zahn gives a fun read and introduces one of the best characters in the EU, Grand Admiral Thrawn. Another really nice feature about this particular edition is it includes author notes about the story which adds a nice little inside look into the publishing process with LucasFilm. Zahn also discusses his thoughts on some of his writing decisions and how they have been changed by the subsequent movies. If you need a star wars fix while waiting for the next trilogy to come out from Disney, this is a good place to start.",3
Yagyu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Yagy Review,"This is my all time favorite Star wars book. Definitely to date the best one ever written. Even the other 2 books in the trilogy are amazing.
Pros:
1: Thrawn. Yes Grand admiral Thrawn, not only a huge fan favorite of myself and countless others but one of the most interesting and awesome additions ever to the Star Wars universe.
2: Thrawns Genius. Thrawn unlike most of the other imperials does not let emotions govern his actions. He is cold, calculating and precise. Think of him like Boba Fett, hes like a chess master, always several moves ahead of the New Republic.
3: Thrawns obsession with art. This was actually really cool, Thrawn is able to discern the enemies weaknesses and strengths by studying the art of their culture.
4: Mara Jade. The second greatest addition to the star wars universe since the lucas movies. Mara Jade once an imperial agent is now trying to live as a smuggler and forget her past when she is caught up in the wave of events that Tim Zahn masterfully unfolds in his story.
5: Talon Kardde. Kardde was also pretty awesome, hes the new smuggler chief now that Jabba is out of the picture.
6: Captain Pelleon. He is fated to become a great leader. But till then he is an interesting character, the perfect imperial officer if you will, tutoring under Grand admiral Thrawn.
7: Nohgri. Its interesting to note that Zahn was going to make them Sith because back then no one knew what a Sith meant. Still the Nohgri are awesome, deadly small nimble assassins.
8: Han Solo, Zahn is a master at writing Han Solo and really catches his sarcastic, hard edged smugglers charm.
9: Joruus C'baoth. I loved this character so much. He was the first real Dark Jedi Master that we are introduced to in the star wars EU, of course by now there are others that take place in time b4 him, but as far as this being the real first star wars EU novel C'baoth was just what the force doctor ordered. What also makes him interesting is the mystery surrounding him, is he evil or just insane? You will have to read to find out.
10: just about everything in this book is awesome.

Cons:
1: Ill put it in here though i kinda disagree but ive seen people complain about the coincidence factor, where like the characters keep ending p in the same place at the same time perfectly in time for a major event. If you ask me it makes sense due to the Force manipulating events to be balanced out.
2: Pronunciation. IE C'baoth, Thrawn, Nohgri ect. The names are clever but yes very hard to pronounce, especially C'baoth. I asked the author how to say it and it wasnt at all like i thought it would be. It was like Sib ah Ohth. And did you know germans cant pronounce Thrawn?
3: Jedi suppression. This part i will agree with, while Luke does do some fun Jedi moves in here it does seem Zahn dislikes writing Jedi and having them use their powers.
4: No Boba Fett :( I was bummed not to see Fett or any of the famous hunters. Zahn told me once that he feels Fett is overrated and would most likely not write him. That made me sad, and while he has had fett in a book he wrote (not this trilogy) it still wasnt really the fett we wanted.

Summery
This book is truly a masterpiece despite the few flaws. Its as close to seeing a star wars movie as you can get in novel format. Theres so much more i could say about it but if you want to know what all the hype is about just go read it!!!",1
Nicholas J Netoff,4.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Star Wars & Zahn,"I've been a big fan of Timothy Zahn for many years which would probably have lead me to read these anyway, never mind them being Star Wars. Starts off a little slow but quickly gets a bit more complicated. I like that there is more to the series than just the straight action, but also gets into the intricacies and complications of political infighting and personal motivations. This is a re-read for me but I'm finding it just as interesting reading it almost 20 years later. I now have a greater appreciation for the subtleties that I didn't truly understand as a young adult. Then I was more concerned with the action than the motivation. If you find the first book too easy, make sure to read the second. As the story unfolds the more the moving pieces begin interacting more with each other and cross paths. Definitely worth the read. I would like to see these Trilogies compiled into one book. Now reading them on a Kindle I see no need to have them separate. It'd also make it easier to keep the sequence of events straight between all the books of the Star Wars series.",1
Arnold,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,A worthy heir,"I won't spend much time reviewing the actual novel because it's been out for 20 years already and I've reviewed it elsewhere. Rather, I'll just say a few words about the new features in this addition. First, Timothy Zahn provides a lot of footnotes and commentary (over 200 footnotes or so). Some are short reflections on what he wrote, but others provide actually pretty interesting insights into the writing process. He mentions where he left clues of plot twists to come, as well as when he simply hadn't thought through the backstory for certain references (the Outbound Flight being the most prominent and surprising example, given that it alone spawned at least two other novels). Zahn is also candid in pointing out where later EU works and prequel films made his narrative obsolete, although he does try to retcon a few items (still, overall, Zahn's books have suffered relatively little retconning even after 20 years). My favorite comments were those tying Zahn's personal life to the book and the writing process. I thought his defense of using lines from the original trilogy movies was brilliant. Overall, this isn't quite the edited version of the Hobbit, which revolutionizes your reading of the novel, but it's still definitely THE way to read Heir to the Empire and a nice treat for fans. Congratulations, Mr. Zahn!",5
Jeffrey T. Munson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Excellent Star Wars Novel,"""Heir to the Empire"" reignited the interest in the Star Wars universe and set the stage for many of the novels that followed.

It has been five years since the destruction of the second Death Star and the death of Emperor Paplatine. The New Republic is struggling to find its way, and the last members of the Empire, led by the cunning Grand Admiral Thrawn, are consolidating the remains of the Imperial fleet and have their sights set on the New Republic.

Thrawn has two assets at his disposal; a dark jedi and a new type of cloaking device. He hopes to unleash the power of the Imperial fleet against the New Republic base on Sluis Van. But the attack does not go as planned, and soon, the Imperials are forced to flee. Meanwhile, Admiral Ackbar has been arrested, forcing Han Solo and Luke Skywalker to return to Coruscant.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Heir to the Empire"". This book was the one that really got the Star Wars novels going, and author Timothy Zahn has done a masterful job of describing events after the Battle of Endor. His character development is flawless, as evidenced by the masterful creation of Grand Admiral Thrawn. Also introduced in ""Heir"" is the brilliant Mara Jade, who, after this book, becomes a regular character in future novels. Also, the continual development of Luke, Han, and Leia (who's pregnant with twins) is well done.

I'm eagerly anticipating reading the other two books in this series. I've been a fan of Star Wars novels for years, but I had never read the ""Heir to the Empire"" series. I'm glad I decided to start. Highly recommended.",1
Nickolas X. P. Sharps,4.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,The Reign of Thrawn Begins!,"REVIEW SUMMARY: Zahn channels the spirit and energy of the original trilogy.

MY RATING: 3.5 Stars

BRIEF SYNOPSIS: The Emperor and Darth Vader may be dead, the Death Star destroyed, but the war has not yet been won. Struggling under the responsibility of politics and diplomatic duties Luke, Han, and Leia now face a new challenge. On the outskirts of the New Republic a brilliant Grand Admiral is gathering the remnants of the Empire in order to strike at the heart of the Rebels.

PROS: Zahn accurately portrays well known characters, the fight against the Empire didn't end with the Ewoks on Endor, Grand Admiral Thrawn is a superb villain, author's notes enhance the experience.

CONS: Luke is sort of a sissy, too many cases of coincidence, Mara Jade isn't all she's cracked up to be, Grand Admiral Thrawn might be too smart.

BOTTOM LINE: Despite some flaws this is still better than anything offered in Episodes I-III and the 20th Anniversary Edition is a great collector's item.

The news of Disney buying Lucasfilm accomplished something that I never would have thought possible. It got me excited about Star Wars again. I used to be a major fan of the series as I think most kids are. My aunt took me to see the original trilogy when the movies were re-released to theaters in the 90's. At the time Taco Bell had promotional Star Wars toys and I also got my first battery-powered lightsaber. It was the Golden Age of my childhood. I continued to love the series well into my teenage years. It wasn't the new trilogy that killed it for me (although that was the start), but the CGI movie, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and the Cartoon Network show it spawned. I hadn't looked back since...that is, until the news of Disney's acquisition.

My first reaction was to laugh. Disney! Buying Star Wars! What a joke! And then I realized that I'd had the same reaction when Disney bought Marvel...and look how awesome The Avengers turned out. Then all the speculation started about what would be in store for Episode VII and that is how I came across Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire. And fortunately for me, Zahn's classic had been released in a beautiful 20th Anniversary Edition, complete with a foreword and author's notes. But enough background and onto the review!

The Rebels won the Battle of Endor. The Emperor and Darth Vader are dead, the Death Star has been destroyed (again), and the Imperial forces have been routed. Star Wars: Return of the Jedi ends on a high note. Too high a note if you ask me. It would seem as though Timothy Zahn felt the same way when he wrote Heir to the Empire. The battle has been won but the war is far from over. Heir to the Empire picks up five years after we left off. Luke is coming to terms with the loss of his mentors. Leia is pregnant with twins. Han has gone legit. All three are chaffing at the roles they find themselves in within the New Republic. Organizing an effective rebellion isn't the same as building a working government. Politics threaten to tear the New Republic apart and a new threat is rising from Imperial territory. That threat is Grand Admiral Thrawn, a brilliant strategist that has gathered the remnants of the Empire together in order to take back what the Rebels have stolen.

First I have to say that the author's notes are an awesome edition to the story. Zahn put an amazing amount of work into Heir to the Empire. The author's notes serve to highlight the special details that might otherwise be glossed over during the read. It turns out that Zahn is responsible for a lot of terms and ideas that most Star Wars fans probably take for granted. This is the man that came up with the legendary Rogue Squadron.

Zahn's greatest strength is in translating everyone's favorite movie characters into text. As I read the dialogue I could hear the actors' voices and picture their mannerisms. Zahn is especially deft at writing Han Solo's roguish wit, Lando Calrissian's charm, C-3PO's neurotic twittering, and (surprisingly) R2-D2's beeping and chirping. Han and Lando really steal the show, it is great fun to see them operating as partners. Leia sort of gets shafted with Heir to the Empire, as she spends the majority of the novel running and hiding from Imperial kidnappers. I was also mildly disappointed with Luke Skywalker. When deprived of the Force and his lightsaber Luke loses most of his appeal. Star Wars: Return of the Jedi left a striking image of Luke in his black suit, taking matters into his own hands. That inspiring version of the Jedi Skywalker is not to be found here. I appreciate Zahn touching on Luke's light depression and anxiety but he fails to show him as the heroic figure that he became with the closing of the original trilogy.

The star of Heir to the Empire is Zahn's creation, Grand Admiral Thrawn. Thrawn is an amazing villain. He has a military background that is something that separates him from the Emperor and Darth Vader. He commands through loyalty rather than fear, and he understands strategy. What is cool is that Thrawn is not Sith. He has no Force powers. If he is going to defeat the New Republic it will be through sheer force of will and military superiority. Granted, Thrawn's intelligence can get to be grating at times. Thrawn is right 99% of the time. Stories aren't fun if the hero always wins and there is a lack of fun if the villain is always right.

Mara Jade is supposed to be another of Zahn's greatest creations, though I'm not yet convinced. From what I understand, she is a favorite among fans. I'm guessing that she gets better in the later novels. I will say that it is nice to have another strong female, especially given that Leia gets swept to the side for most of Heir to the Empire, but Jade's beef with Luke just strikes me as silly. It basically comes down to, ""You ruined my life because I didn't get to kill you at Jabba's Palace so now I hate you and want to kill you."" It definitely doesn't help that once Luke finds out the motivation behind Jade's hatred he is almost apologetic about the fact that he is still alive.

The plot is fun but the formula does get repetitive. The all knowing Thrawn sends his lackeys after our heroes, the heroes narrowly escape, the heroes devise a plan to avoid the Imperials, Thrawn almost automatically guesses what the plan is, annnnnd repeat. There is just too much coincidence. I'm willing to accept the guiding influence of the Force in the Star Wars universe but a rose by any other name is still deus ex machina. Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back has always been my favorite of the movies because of the darker tone and so Heir to the Empire hits the sweet spot in that department. Heir to the Empire has that same dark flavor as well as some more mature themes relating to the politicking. The action isn't quite what I'd hoped for though the Battle for the Sluis Van shipyards is a great finale to the novel.

All in all I enjoyed Heir to the Empire. It truly felt like the sequel Star Wars: Return of the Jedi always deserved. Those that dislike the Ewoks and found the Battle of Endor to end too cleanly will likely agree with this sentiment. I am interested to read more about Grand Admiral Thrawn and I hope to see Mara Jade develop into a better rounded character. I'd also like to see Luke return to his awesome heroic ways. I'd appreciate more of the Han/Lando team-up and maybe Leia will find more of the spotlight. I will be purchasing Star Wars: Dark Force Rising but I think perhaps I'll wait to see if they release a 20th Anniversary Edition of that as well.

L.M.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Some good moments but distracted by writing style,"I kept hearing how this is such a classic series and a must-read for Star Wars fans I was really looking forward to diving in. While I enjoyed it overall, I got distracted by how often the writer overuses certain words and phrases. Characters are always ""flicking their eyes"" over things or saying things ""sardonically"" or ""growling"". I thought the story itself was ok. I will probably check out the other books in the series eventually just because it's so highly regarded.",1
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Brilliant,"It has been a long time since I've explored the Star Wars universe. Just recently, I began dabbling again, and Star Wars: Heir to the Empire: The 20th Anniversary Edition (Star Wars (Del Rey)) caught my eye. Obviously, it's been twenty years, but I missed it the first time around. It's all new to me, but I'm glad I found it now. What a thrill it was to read. Timothy Zahn expertly captured the true spirit of Star Wars, and I was happy to see him let the personalities of each of the main characters remain true. I could practically see Luke, Leia, Han and even R2-D2 jump right out of the pages. What skill! I'd often finish reading a passage and wondered how he did that.

This book takes place after Return of the Jedi, with the return of all the main characters and the addition of new ones. It is the first of a trilogy, so expect a cliffhanger. I am right there and can't wait to see it to the end.

If you are wondering whether to get the 20th Anniversary Edition, I'd say go for it. The notes in the margin are plenty and they add a lot of insight to the story. As for the Kindle edition, download a sample first. I did, and was glad I bought the dead tree version. Flipping between the notes and the reading would have driven me nuts.

Happy reading! MTFBWY.",2
Bernie Gourley,4.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,An awesome villain in the time line of the original set of movies.,"“Heir to the Empire” is set about five years after the first movie trilogy (by release date, i.e. after “Return of the Jedi.”) It features many of the principal heroes of the first trilogy including: Luke, Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, and C-3PO. Obviously, gone are most of the bad guys from the movies, but in their place has risen Grand Admiral Thrawn—a master strategist who seeks to revive the Empire. Thrawn is portrayed more as a brilliant military man than a dastardly villain. This doesn’t mean he can’t be cold and villainous, but he also brings in a measure of intellect and rationality not seen in the movie universe. While it would appear that Luke is the last of the Jedi Knights, or the first of a new line if one prefers, that turns out to be not entirely true.

I enjoyed this book. I bought it during a Kindle sale on what Amazon considered to be the best “Star Wars” books. While I’d seen the movies, I hadn’t read any of ancillary works, and so I Googled to find out which of the books on Amazon’s list were considered by fans to be the best. Zahn’s Thrawn trilogy, and particularly this first installment, seemed to be on every fan’s list.

One of the great plot devices used in this book is a creature whose mere presence can nullify the force. This strips Luke’s powers away through a critical piece of the book. Yes, the introduction of this creature is deus ex machina, but it’s deus ex machina that challenges the protagonist--rather than making life easier for him--so it’s alright by me. Because Luke is the last of the known Jedi, he’s essentially a Superman among mere mortals, and so the book might have become tedious if Luke weren’t stripped to his native intellect and courage devoid of superpowers. Instead, he has to escape from the planet on which these creatures reside and help rescue Han and Lando in the process without any supernatural abilities.

As mentioned, this is the first book of a trilogy, and, therefore, it leaves many major issues unresolved. Multi-part series usually have less satisfying endings than a stand-alone book, and I can’t say it’s not true of this work. However, this first book of the Thrawn trilogy does contain a clear climax and a definitive tactical (battle-level) resolution.

The book intersperses chapters from the hero’s point of view (PoV) with those from the Thrawn’s ship. This book begins with a chapter from the enemy’s PoV, and so for “Star Wars” neophytes—such as myself—one enters into a whole new territory in which it’s not quite certain when or where one is in the “Star Wars” universe. However, in subsequent chapters Luke, Leia, and Han are introduced and we learn that Han and Leia are married and that Leia is pregnant, and this gives one insight into the timeline of the book. We also learn that while the Empire seems to have been destroyed, the Republic is on week footing and is having trouble reestablishing itself.

The book introduces us to a couple of new characters that I understand will become established in the expanded “Star Wars” universe. The most intriguing and important of these is Mara Jade, the right hand woman of the most powerful smuggler in the known universe. We soon learn that Mara despises Luke Skywalker and wants nothing more than to dance on his grave. However, we don’t learn until much later why it is that she hates him, and we learn after a time during which the two are forced together by circumstances. Mara Jade is a force to be reckoned with. While she might not be a match for Luke the Jedi, she is more than a match for Luke stripped of his powers. It seems clear that Zahn is building a relationship between Luke and Mara with their interaction in this book. Luke is oblivious to why Mara dislikes him, or even who she is until he is explicitly told, but events force them to spend time together under trying circumstances.

All in all, I liked this book. I found it readable, and thought that it did a good job of maintaining tension throughout.",4
Danial Hallock,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Picks up After Episode VI,"This book picks up after Episode VI very smoothly following the exploits of Luke, Leia, Chewie, and Han as they attempt to rebuild the Republic after the questionable defeat of the Empire at the battle of Endor. We follow the storylines of our main characters as they are harassed by political infighting and a brilliant tactician from the remenants of the Empire, Grand Admiral Thrawn.

It's an awesome read that shows a lot of additional character development (especially for Leia and Han, something that was lacking in the Luke-centric movie trilogy) and answers many of the questions of what happens after the defeat of the Emperor.

I just hope the book isn't rendered moot by the upcoming movies.",1
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,One of a kind,"This book is amazing. The book itself is great. Heir is easily one of my favorite Star Wars books of all time and the 20th anniversary edition is a work of art in its own right. The amount of detail that Tim Zann added to this version of the book makes it well worth the cost to me. The extras may get in the way for anyone looking to just read the book, but for someone like me who had already read the book a few years ago this was a way to own the book and learn some more about the Star Wars universe.

The actual story itself is classic Star Wars, with the main characters getting into problems forced on them by other characters and themselves. The empire is still the bad guy, but some of the characters show a different side to the empire than is normally portrayed by other writers and in the films.

Bottom line: buy this if you have ever wanted to own a copy of the book. Also, if you have been reading Star Wars and have never read this book read it now. This was the original Star Wars book.",1
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,First Star Wars novel ever read for me,"As someone who saw the original ""Star Wars"" in the theatres back when movies cost $1 and has never read any of the Star Wars books, this was immensely enjoyable.
It was only after seeing ""The Force Awakens"" with my children who are about the same age as I was when I saw it that I realized I probably should start reading up on the history after the Death Star goes boom.
I also was an avid player of Star Wars: The Old Republic (SWTOR) MMO and that gave me even more lore to digest as that happened several thousand years before Vader and Luke. (I actually played a real Sith and Chiss!)
I bought the three pack and am now reading the second book.
It's highly recommended from a long time fan of the universe and the perfect book to help get caught up for all the new movies to come.",4
Strategos,4.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,"The Mind of Thrawn, the Hand of Zahn","Before this book, I had never read a Star Wars book. Nor had I ever read a book by Timothy Zahn. I was NOT ready for what I encountered. In the trilogy of books in this series, Zahn manages to create one of the coolest villains in all of sci-fi. Personally, I think Grand Admiral Thrawn is a better villain than Vader (but that just me). Through the course of the book he will take the remnants of the dying Empire and put them back on the road to supremacy. When I try to picture him in my mind I see him as a kind of evil version of General Lee in a sci-fi setting. He's a military genius with the uncanny ability to read the mind of his opponents and win repeatedly despite being vastly outnumbered. But is he really evil? Or just extremely ambitious?
Also created in this amazing book series is what has become one fo the most popular characters in the Star Wars universe: Mara Jade. The red-haired young woman with strong force powers and a love/hate relationship with Luke Skywalker also makes a compelling new character. Of course with this being a Star Wars book, all the old characters from the movies return, and the feeling you get from listening to them might be compared to the feeling a person gets from meeting with some old friends he hasn't seen in a long time.
Timothy Zahn's writing style isn't overly descriptive, but neither is it entirely cold. If I had to describe his style I would call it the perfect ADVENTURE style. When reading his books (and I have read several since this one), you get the same feeling you would from watching a book adventure film. Everything moves along at a brisk pace.
Of course, the first book in the series is really just setting up the situation and the characters. We find out Thrawn intentions and see his grand plan start, but you'll have to read all three books to see the real meat of the story. I highly recommend all three books in the series.",1
00frodo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Excellent edition of one of the best works in the Star Wars franchise,"Heir to the Empire is a classic. It's no surprise that this book is considered by many fans to be Star Wars: Episode VII. The novel is essentially a sequel to Return of the Jedi, picking up 5 years after it left off. All the characters act just like they did in the films, and all your favorites are given a chance to shine. Unlike the prequels, the new characters introduced in this novel are interesting and alot of fun. In many ways this is what the prequel trilogy should have been, or at least the feel of it. If you are a fan of the original trilogy, I would highly recommend giving this a shot. It's an exciting read, and you might find yourself reminded why Star Wars was once one of the most quality franchises around.",1

I finally received it on September 20th. However, I must say it was worth the wait. The dust cover is gorgeous, the book front and back is a fabulous rendition of the original cover of 20 years ago! I have not read the novel yet but did read all of the annotations and forward, afterward, and introductory comments and they all increased my longing to reread the story itself which I have not done for sometime. I hope that they commission a special edition for the other two books in the trilogy for their 20th!",2
NWLB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,The best of the expanded universe. If only all the rest were as good.,Strongly recommended. Zahn's writing captures the feel of the movies and Star Wars universe. This was the Star Was expanded universe before Lucas let it run amuck with ever growing numbers of basically lousy writing and poorly thought-out continuations. You feel these stories fit well and would have made excellent movies. You don't have over-the-top characters like the Vong or million ship mega battles that simply feel like cop-out rather than well considered Star Wars scenarios.,1

Mike,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Brilliant,"A cold calculating villain awaits for you in this wonderfully well written star wars novel. This, after the movies, was one of the first star wars products to delve into the expanded universe, or EU for short. Me, being an avid star wars lover of both movies and expanded universe, took great pleasure in seeing where the EU started out. Even without all that, this book is a standalone great piece.",1
ClawsofHonor,3.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,good story...horrible copy of the actual paperbacks,"I have this trilogy in paperback ....and love the story. Having said that, the transcription from book to e-book is horrible. Mass mispellings, many parts of certain chapters weren'tseperated and ran back to back. It's almost as if it was typed by a 14 yr old who can't even proofread his/her own work. Half the time you can tell words were misspelled because the autocorrection completely changes the word from the original. If you have a tablet, get this trilogy on a different e-reader program.",2
Darth Malak,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,A Trip Down Memory Lane,Heir to the Empire was the first Star Wars novel I ever read. At the time I had not even thought of Star Wars for several years. Heir brought me make to being a full fledged Star wars geek. I found the introduction and footnotes a delight to read. It was fascinating to learn what goes through an author's head as he is developing a story. I had several moments where I could not help but laugh out loud. This is a must read for any Star Wars fan who fell in love with the Expanded Universe.,2
Roberto M. Barros,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,The best Star Wars expanded universe book,"Since I just added it to my Wish List, I cannot comment on whether this new edition is worth buying for those who already have the original book. But I definitely can say that if you have not, BUY IT NOW and READ IT. Heir (and the following 2 books from the Thrawn Trilogy) are easily the best books ever from the Star Wars expanded universe.

In fact, I do believe that if George Lucas ever did the chapters 7-9 (which he mentioned once he would not due to matters of his and the original actors ages), they would be these 3 books. And what movies would they be...The books are much more like the original trilogy in how they flow than the prequel trilogy. The pace, the character building, the plots, the twists, the duels, the new additions to the story, all of them take their time to happen, instead of the frantic nature of the prequel movies (and most current movies btw). So magic can be built and appreciated on the reader's mind. Nothing seems irrelevant in the story, nevertheless the story is quite detailed and complex. And yet, it's not a complex reading.

Instead of the master-apprentice domination-or-betrayal relationship between the Emperor and Vader, we have the master cunning strategist Imperial Admiral Thrawn (a Spock-lookalike version of German Otto von Bismarck) coming back from the Outer Rims just to find out that his Empire was defeated by the rebels. But he finds and enters an allegiance with long lost Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth (which could be described as a Sith version of Lord Of The Rings Saruman). Thrawn plays his battle tactics like a chess master and always seems to be two steps ahead of the former rebels. And his plans involve a new creature called ysalamiri, that despite the awful name are unique animals whose abilities will permeate the whole trilogy and affect many of the action in the book. On his side, C'baoth wants the future children of Han and Leia to be his apprentices.

Luke still has ways to go on his path to become a Jedi Master and sees in C'baoth the opportunity to learn from a Master. But he is also confronted with Mara Jade,a skilled red haired bounty hunter with previous associations with the Empire on her path to revenge. And related to all that, we are introduced to the delicious characters of Talon Karrde, a more tactful Han Solo-like smuggler and pragmatic decision maker whose allegiances are always on the move, and of the Noghri, a species that seem to be a kind of blend between the Ewoks and Bobba Fett.

Finally, we have another Lando Calrisian mining adventure on a weird planet, several Rogue Squadron battles like in Episode 4 and 6, some quality time spent at Chewbacca's planet (forget the prequels...) and Leia is learning her ways in the force, although she works as a politician in Coruscant.

In a nutshell, Star Wars as it should be.

Besides the Heir Trilogy, I believe that the best Star Wars books are the books between Episode 6 and The Heir trilogy, the first X-Wing books, and some of the Yuuzhan Vong stories (not all of them unfortunately, the series started well, but then it went on a roller coaster succession of ups and downs, ending up lost in itself).",5
Schmiggy_JK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,A celebration of the rebirth of Star Wars,"Timothy Zahn is very humble in the introduction to this 20th anniversary edition trying not to take credit for ""restarting"" Star Wars in the early 90's but the reality is that this novel did exactly that for me and millions of other fans and still to this day is the centerpiece and starting point for so many people jumping in to the Star Wars Expanded Universe.

This book is the ""The Empire Strikes Backs"" of Star Wars novels. One of the first and definitely one of the best and it still holds up incredibly well to this day with very few issues regarding canon on top of being such a great read.

My favorite aspect of this anniversary edition is probably the annotations done by Zahn, written in the margins of the book, exploring key concepts, characters or just noting on how to pronounce names. It really adds a new layer of depth to the novel and helps get inside of his head during and after his writing process. These alone are worth the purchase price to fans of the book who may have read this before.

On top of that we get a forward from Lucas Licensing, an introduction by Zahn, both recapping the history of this novel and its beginnings.

And lastly the a novella from Zahn is included titled ""Crisis of Faith"", which you may want to read after you read his latest book ""Choices of One"". It gives a new look into Grand Admiral Thrawn that should not be missed.

This is a fantastic package for the price and a must-own for any fans of the ""Thrawn Trilogy"" as it is commonly referred as.",19

SocraticMethod,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Kindle Edition review,"The book is amazing and I suggest looking at reviews of the original paperback for insights on the book. I'm simply writing briefly about the Kindle edition of this 20th Anniversary edition.

While the hardcover has the notes by Timothy Zahn in the margins, this Kindle edition has hyperlinks which you have to scroll over and click on, which take you to a section in the back of the book with all the notations. I thought this would be a major pain, but it's not bad at all. It's very quick still and I never felt annoyed by it. I would've preferred a hardcover copy to be honest (and recommend that if you have the option), but I live in Korea now so I had to download the Kindle version. That said, I'm very satisfied with having bought this edition.

The notes themselves are more entertaining than I'd expected. I thought they'd be boring, tedious notes, but they give great insight into the story, the SW universe, as well as cool production notes such as limitations with what he was contractually allowed to do, and so on.

I'd highly recommend getting this book in either format and especially for any Star Wars fan or fan of light sci-fi/fantasy novels.

P.S. PLEASE support this book by purchasing it if you're interested. The publisher has stated that if this edition is successful enough they'll release similar 20th anniversary editions of Dark Force Rising and The Last Command.",14
HWLights92,4.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,A Sequel Worthy of the Star Wars Universe,"After the success of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, interest in the saga began to wane a little and LucasFilm decided to authorize the creation of novels set in the ""Star Wars"" universe, specifically ones set after the events of the third (sixth) film: ""Return of the Jedi"".

Timothy Zahn does a great job at writing all of the characters from the ""Star Wars"" trilogy with the appropriate voices, and creates situations that are believable given the environment.

At times reading through the novel I laughed; other times I cried. At all times though I heard Luke, Leia, Han, and Lando in their exact voices from the film. At points I could even image what John Williams incredible score would sound like over some of the more epic parts of the book.

Zahn also takes the liberty of adding to the ""Star Wars"" mythos by creating new characters including Grand Admiral Thrawn and Mara Jade, the Emperor's Hand to name just two. While I didn't have actual voices or appearances to match with these characters, at least in the cinematic sense, I was still able to picture and hear these characters believably alongside the likenesses of Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Billy Dee Williams.

Zahn definitely has me hooked in to read the other two books to see where this story goes. And even if Episode VII sucks, we'll always have the Thrawn trilogy.",1

The characters are one-dimensional, and the plot is simplistic and relies on amazing coincidence to advance.
Nothing really special here, and I doubt I will bother reading the other two books in the series.",1

Dewhooya,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Still a classic after 20+ years,"Zahn brought back the original Star Wars team some 20 years ago, of course without a few key members who had passed into the Force by then. The three book story of Thrawn and his armada of ships introduces many of the characters who have kept going in the Star Wars Expanded Universe stories. Zahn also created a Han and Leia love story, a Luke Jedi Master adventure and meeting his future bride, Lando and Chewie both add their own valuable assistance at every turn to make this a true continuation of the Star Wars main story.
Highly recommended as a second or third time read, as I have, but even more strongly recommended for first time readers of the trilogy.

Mark,4.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,A Great Start to the EU,"In the Thrawn Trilogy, Timothy Zahn kicks off the EU proper with a trilogy usually regarded as one of the EU's high points--and with good reason. Zahn definitely has a feel for Star Wars and his writing is perfectly suited for the task at hand. Thrawn is an extremely compelling character, as is Palleon. Jorus C'boath is another interesting character, and Mara Jade is downright essential. Most good EU novels will follow the same sort of direction as what Zahn did in the Thrawn trilogy, and characters from these books will pop up time and time again in subsequent EU books.",1

M. F. Wingard,3.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Not fantastic,"I enjoyed the read and don't regret the purchase. I agree with any positive comments others have made, but I had some problems with the book.
First off, and this sort of thing bothered me with Shadows of the Empire too, Zahn uses ""the other"" hundreds of times (over 200 by the Kindle's count). For instance, ""'Yes, sir,' the other said carefully"" and ""He heard a note of regret in the other's voice."" Seriously annoying. Hundreds and hundreds of times.

**SPOILER**
The use of Force-blocking lizards that no one has heard of before now and Thrawn's superhuman intuition seem very deus ex machina-y.",2

RocER,2.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Don't agree with the hype - Mild Spoilers,"I had never read any Star Wars novels before until last year when I TRIED reading Aftermath (gawd, what dreck that was), but have been a huge fan of the films since I was a kid. I decided to try this book out because so many people miffed that JJ Abrams and Disney abandoned the EU expressed strongly-held convictions that the Thrawn trilogy was the most worthy successor to Return of the Jedi, and deserved it's rightful place in film canon. I figured I'd give it a try. Mostly it was a fast fun read, I pretty much tore through it, but partially out of spite, I just wanted it to be over. I'll give it points for being readable.

As for the story and character development? Meh. If this book stood alone, without the character development of the films you wouldn't care a lick about Leia, Han, Luke, or Chewy. And contrary to most positive reviewers' assessments, I found neither Thrawn nor Mara Jade particularly compelling additions to the cast. In the case of Thrawn, he seemed like an inferior version of the Mule from Asimov's Foundation trilogy. In the case of Mara Jade, her motivations were supposed to be the big reveal of the storyline, and they're finally offered in the most unsatisfying way (an admission) and ultimately lack the expected motivation (her feelings are hurt because the prestige she believed she had, she lost, but as her admission goes on, you realize that same prestige was only in her own mind, since her true role prior to her life being ruined was a secret).

But the worst of all of the characters (an opinion I'm baffled so many find to the contrary) is the ""Dark Jedi Clone"" C'Baoth (a name that was so gratingly irritating to pronounce in my mind as I read, I wanted to toss the book every time it appeared). His introduction is like a Monty Python skit about an evil wizard: ""Mwuahahaha! I'm so EVIL. I killed the other evil Jedi who used to guard this evil mountain full of evil stuff"",(what's even the purpose of that plot point?), ""Now I will invite you in and kill you with my force lighten.. Wha? Furry lizard? I'll bite your legs off"". Which brings us to the ysalamiri. Creatures that block the force with anti-force bubbles? The all encompassing energy that is created by life, surrounds us, and binds the universe together? Ugh.

Aside from the character development, I found each character's narrative and motivation contrived and full of holes that the author went to great pains to explain away through convoluted if-then-therefore situations that went on ceaselessly in each character's head. Each individual storyline, particularly Leia's, was completely disconnected from an overlying story arc (other than Thrawn's rising influence, or in the case of Luke and Han - a coincidental visit to the same planet). Other annoying details include a Wookie whose speech impediment enables him to speak English (or Basic if you prefer), the ""scent"" of Vader, re-use of dialogue from the original Trilogy as a substitute for development of existing characters (and I'm not just talking about ""I've got a bad feeling about this"" - which I have no qualms with reusing).

Bottom line, if you're a Star Wars canon obsessive who enjoys the ""Science-Fictioning"" of Star Wars through explanations for various aspects of the Galaxy far, far away that seem counter-intuitive, self-contradictory, or just plain mistakes in plotting (a la Wookipedia), then this book might appeal to you. If you don't care about the logical inconsistencies of the OT films and view them as their own separate (and superior) canon: i.e., fun space fantasies with characters you adored as a child, I'd skip this and the rest of the novels in the series. I won't be reading any further.",4
John,4.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Consider the ebook carefully,"For those who are considering the Kindle version, take a moment to think about the mechanics of reading it. The hardcover version has the annotations in the margins of the pages, meaning you can easily ready, shift your eyes over to the notes and continue reading. The ebook has the notes all the way in the back. The annotations are numbered in the text of the book, and those numbers are hyperlinked, so you can go back and forth between the two, but I have to say it's a bit slow. I'm on a Nook Color, but even overclocked to 1.2 ghz, it takes about one to two full seconds to go back and forth. It doesn't sound like much, but some chapters have 20 annotations, that's a lot of time waiting to go back and forth. Further, if the annotation falls on the margin of a page, you can easily confuse your ereader as it won't know if you're trying to turn a page or link to the annotation.

Still, I can't fault the content here. The introductions are great, and the annotations range from little tidbits to genuine insight into Zahn's head at the time he was writing this.",67

On a positive note the characters are written well, especially Han.",1
Yeah,2.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,Completely Devoid of Any Star Wars Magic,"I just finished The Thrawn Trilogy, and I agree very much with what I've read in the 1-star and 2-star reviews. This trilogy was nothing at all like the original Star Wars movies. I forced myself to read the 1,400 pages, just so I could say I read it and know I gave it a chance. The familiar characters -- Luke, Leia, Han, Lando, Chewie, and the droids -- had no real life to them, not very much personality at all. And the new characters -- Thrawn, Paelleon, Mara, Karrde, and C'baoth -- were really boring. I felt no attachment whatsoever to any of them. And most important of all, there was absolutely no mythological layer to the entire story, which is what the magic of the original Star Wars is all about. I honestly would not recommend The Thrawn Trilogy to anyone. If you want to read a good Star Wars novel, read Steve Perry's Shadows of the Empire.",2

This must have been one of the first because there are barley any sound fx or music cues, the guy who played Wedge in the movies reads this one, though Anthony Daniels (C-3p0) reads the other two - odd! Any way, he gives a slow, dry performance that could put you to sleep. So many people said the plot was action packed, equal to the movies but the dialog scenes seemed to drag out endlessley to make up for the short action scenes. Just the tone of the book seemed off from the movies, the pacing totally different. And the most anoying part of any of the audio books - they all pronounce Courascant as ""Chorus-scant."" Maybe the books were better but the plot was not interesting enough to bring me back for book two. Shadow of the Empire, however seemed pitch perfect, and the voice actor was able to to a different voice for every character that really made it come alive - at least in the audio book.",4

Nate,1.0 out of 5 stars,Star Wars : Heir to the Empire,A great barometer for your Star Wars EU experience!,"Zahn is widely considered to be one of the premier authors in the EU. I will now give you an unedited paragraph from chapter one of this book:

---

The TIE fighters launched, accelerating away from the Chimaera and then leaning hard into etheric rudders to sweep back around it like the spray of some exotic fountain. The invading ships spotted the attackers and shifted vectors—

Pellaeon blinked. “What in the Empire are they doing?”

“They’re trying the only defense they know of against a Marg Sabl,” Thrawn said, and there was no mistaking the satisfaction in his voice. “Or, to be more precise, the only defense they are psychologically capable of attempting.” He nodded toward the flashing sphere. “You see, Captain , there’s an Elom commanding that force . . . and Elomin simply cannot handle the unstructured attack profile of a properly executed Marg Sabl.”

Pellaeon stared at the invaders, still shifting into their utterly useless defense stance . . . and slowly it dawned on him what Thrawn had just done. “That sentry ship attack a few minutes ago,” he said. “You were able to tell from that that those were Elomin ships?”

""Learn about art, Captain,” Thrawn said, his voice almost dreamy. “When you understand a species’ art, you understand that species.”

It is ambitious in scale and in content, and, while it is difficult to internalize in one reading, it is worthwhile for anyone wanting to improve their life in ways that are meaningful. I consider it on par with titles such as ""How to Win Friends and Influence People,"" and ""Think and Grow Rich,"" which is no small compliment. Highly recommended.",23
Lee Gillette,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,"You've done it again, Mr. Maltz.","One of the first copies of Maxwell Maltz's book, Psycho-Cybernetics is still, to this day, on my bookshelf.

In 1961, It did much more than just put me on my quest for self-improvement. For the very first time, someone connected the mind to the body and brought home the old, simple adage ... ""Change your Mind and you change your life!""

That was Psycho-Cybernetics. That was the principle of Self Image Psychology ... proven and verified by science itself as an irresistible and powerful no nonsense psychology of happiness and fulfillment.

From there on ... for decades ... everything else that was printed in the Self Help Industry became supporting commentary for the principles in this book.

An now ... the new ""enhanced"" version of Psycho-Cybernetics just arrived. And Yesssss!!! I enjoyed this one as much as the original. If not more so!

Comparing the two, the new authors kept the voice and the insights of the original text intact, integrating only the updates needed for new generations to come to experience and cherish the joy of reading this old, new classic for the first time. And experience it, you will. You cannot do otherwise.

Indeed, it gives me great pleasure to recommend this new version of the book that's been around for over a half century. If you are not among the 35 million+ people who read the older one ... please, do yourself a favor ... get a copy now and read it!

You will find that Psycho-Cybernetics will do it to you, as it did it to us, decades ago. True to its kind, the new Enhanced version of Psycho-Cybernetics is still the only book that scientifically proves the principle of Self Image Psychology and makes it the new foundation for a new century's hope, success and the dream of a better life.

And the beat goes on!",43
Richard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,I've come across and read a lot from people like Jack Canfield,"I've been on a self-help reading kick for about the past year. Between issues in my finances, health, relationships, career, I was being weighed down by it all. I've come across and read a lot from people like Jack Canfield, Joel Osteen, Law of Attraction - Teachings of Abraham, etc. They were all good, uplifting and helpful works in their own right, but something was missing. I was listening to a podcast and the host mentioned this book, which was something I've never heard about - ever or anywhere. I looked it up on Amazon and decided to order it. I am sure glad I did. For me, it brought all of the other ideas, concepts and practices together. Things like affirmations, burning desires, faith, action - they all are great, as long as they're operating in conjunction with the way you see yourself and want to see yourself. This book really stresses the importance of focusing on your self-image, which is something I've found many of the other works glossed over or lacked. It's a good work, laced with some biblical references which aren't overwhelming. If you can spend the money on it, it is certainly a great addition to your library. I've recommended it to everyone.",36
Andrei,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,That which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger... it's just a matter of how you choose to see things.,"One of the best self help books I've ever read... written in the 60's by a plastic surgeon to help those still disfigured after reconstructive surgery get on with life, it will give you skills to accept and be at peace with almost anything life will ever dump on you. Once you read this you will realize how many recent best sellers just regurgitate knowledge and wisdom that was already available 50 years to centuries ago, now for the sake of making a buck.

This was recommended to me back in 1976 when I was 19, has made all the difference in the world, has also made a profound difference to everyone I have ever suggested this to and helped through crisis (and still do now, 2016.) When everyone is running around with their heads cut off you'll be the calm one wondering what the fuss is all about... able to maintain perspective and focused on what's important and needs to be done personally and professionally when either or both worlds seem to be falling in on you... I've more than survived brain damage (more than once) , divorce, career ending disability, cancer, premature death of those closest to me.. things I never expected... and can say that which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger if you happen to have the right set of coping skills in your bag of tricks. When people marvel how I just keep on going and wonder how I do it.... and I say... read this book... Every moment you are alive is a gift, that's why its called the present. be happy, be well... make the most of what you do have.",11
Brian Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Funny name. Great book!," “Creative striving for a goal that is important to you as a result of your own deep felt needs, aspirations and talents (and not the symbols which the ‘Joneses’ expect you to display) brings happiness as well as success because you will be functioning as you were meant to function. Man is by nature a goal-striving being. And because man is ‘built that way’ he is not happy unless he is functioning the way he was made to function—as a goal-striver. Thus true success and true happiness not only go together but each enhances the other.”

“Every human being has been literally ‘engineered for success’ by his Creator. Every human being has access to a power greater than himself.”

~ Maxwell Maltz from Psycho-Cybernetics

Psycho-Cybernetics. Funny name.

Great book! Maxwell Maltz was a world-renowned plastic surgeon who discovered that, while some people’s lives changed dramatically after he altered their appearance through plastic surgery, some people’s lives *didn’t*. He deduced that the primary factor that differentiated these groups was their self-image—not what they saw in the mirror but the images they had of themselves in their MINDS. Cool stuff.

He spent the second half of his career merging this self-image psychology with the then-popular science of “cybernetics”—which studies how things like guided missiles or “servo-mechanisms” hit their targets through a clear goal and constant adjustment of their course.

Here are some of the Big Ideas:

1. Cybernetics - Servo-mechanisms & you.
2. The Success Instinct - We’ve all got it!
3. Imagination - The first key.
4. Dehypnotize Yourself! - Starting now. :)
5. Rational Thought - How to use it.

Here’s to getting our Psycho-Cybernetic on as we set inspired goals, imagine our ideals, take action as we correct inevitable mistakes and practice FEELING our success. :)

Elias,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,"Self Image, the true success book","I have had many obstacles throughout life. The reasons for my obstacles finally dawned upon me through the wise words of Bob Proctor, as he mentioned the self image. He recommended a book on it, by Maxwell Maltz. Anyone who wants to make a change, a true change, this book is for you. If it's losing that weight for real, or getting that confidence, or daring to do amazing & out of the comfort zone things, then as mentioned THIS IS FOR YOU! Changing your self image and having an honest look on your self, will not only improve the quality of your life but those around you as well.

Nafiz Elgun,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,The best self book on mindset EVER!,"This book was recommended by a millionaire mentor of mine. This book has already started to help me immensely turn my brain and thoughts into an asset instead of it being a battlefield of negative thoughts and having the self image of myself as being unworthy and not believing in myself.

I remember reading reviews for this book only 2 months ago and trying to convince myself not to take the plunge despite all of the people saying this book changed their life.

Well...it was one of the best decisions I have made. And i confidently know I will use the practices in this book for the rest of my life to be a happy, confident, and strong goal-attacking person. Dr. Maltz's guidance is already starting to ring in my head almost daily.

I value the mental benefits of this book in the thousands honestly.

Just get it. Start. Do the practice exercises. Don't be judgmental of it and it will work for you.",2
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Top 10 of all time.,"This is one of those few books that put forth a new idea that has not only stood the test of time but has been woven into the fabric of the entire self development industry. It's up there with ""Think and Grow Rich"" and "" How to win friends and influence people"".

It starts slow and after 2 or 3 chapters I was beginning to question the purchase. ""There is nothing to DO"" I thought. Then after it got going I felt there was TOO MUCH to do. Lots of excersises.

Of course, like so many things, the crux is in the application. Will you use it?

I think the thing I liked best is that you can really hear Dr Maltzs' passion for humanity and sincere desire to help. He seems like a wonderful man.

Also that he isn't in the pie-in-the-sky ""anyone can do anything"" camp. He teaches us to be truthful about our actual limitations, which do have limits, but are far above what most people do or even aspire to.

I put this on a short Must Read list of a handful of classics and consider it a must for anyone pursuing their full potential.

Buy it. Read it. Use it. You won't regret it.",3

a_man,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Unlock your personality,"I stumbled upon this book by accident, having read a profound article that mentioned this book as one of its sources. I bough this book for less than 10 dollars and I must say, this is one of the best investments I have ever made. Easy to read, this book's ideas MAKE SENSE and are profound. I'd like to save my biggest reviews for one chapter only: Unlock your personality. I read this chapter at time when I was depressed, because I didn't get along with people too well. I was reserved, shy and was a social dud. My entire college years, I've been a social dud. My social life sucked. It sucked because I didn't know how to get along with people - I was irritable with people and might have appeared mean to many. The chapter: Unlock your personality might have changed my life. To follow the chapter and its advices precisely requires faith in yourself. A great leap indeed. Don't think, says the late Dr. Maltz -and act. Thinking only complicates things further. Don't think, don't over analyze yourself and just BE. It might as well be a magic bullet. It was for me, I think. Read that chapter over, and over, and over and it will eventually click. Be yourself is the message - and don't think. In social situations, don't think - and just be. Just be. Read the chapter, and you will understand what I mean. ;)",14

This world renowned plastic surgeon, through his practice and research, discovered how the mind particularly the subconscious mind plays a significant role in guiding individuals to their greater destiny! As I told the hundreds of individuals to whom I referred this book.....THIS IS A BOOK TO EXPERIENCE, NOT JUST READ!

Guillermo Velez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Worth the try for the cost,"Facts: It rook me months to do a decent job to relax and use the techniques described in the book. More than one reading and reading into details were necessary for me to grasp the right way to visualize what I wanted. The essentials of the book probably could me summarized in one chapter but the book includes a lot of examples, typical of this type of books. I did not achieve much the first couple of months on my first goal of reach my ideal weight. Then, my wife got me into a weight loss program and now I am well on my way to reach my goal. I keep doing the relaxation and visualization of reaching my ideal weight.

Opinion: I seek for a way to ""program"" the subconscious for a long time and this is the closest thing I have found. I started with a goal and the right tool just came along and I do not believe in coincidences. The weight loss program is making me loss weight. The techniques described in the book makes me follow the program with a very high level of discipline. The desire to reach my target weight is so high that I am able to sort almost all challenges I face to deviate from the weight loss program. I think that for the cost of the book is worth the try if you believe that you are a person of habit, that you behavior is ruled by your subconscious and you need to program that subconscious mind to change your behavior and achieve your goal",1

The sooner in life you can get these perspectives, the better for you and your loved ones. The theme in each chapter tends to develop somewhat slowly. Maltz tends to gather various points, from many different authors and sources, and takes some pages so that they coalesce into very significant and meaningful approaches to life that have immense practical value. And this is a workbook, meant to be used as a guide for your own personal work, which we all need to do very much of. Just reading it quickly through and moving on to the next book would be a huge waste.

I personally found much of the material to be ... not dense ... but dry. I hate to say that because Maltz is clearly such an intelligent man with an important message and helpful advice. But, it is true, in my opinion.

If you are challenged by insecurities and an inaccurate, negative self-image, this is a must-read.",1

After several moves, it was lost. I recently repurchased it due to it's past impact on my thinking. A primary point that the late Dr. Maltz emphasized was his observation that plastic surgery had unexpected results with different people. For some, a minor correction caused a major personality change for the better. For others, even where the cosmetic change was more pronounced, the person's personality changed little, if at all. He attributed this to the person's innner / self image. Another key point was the power of visualization, that, if vivid / realistic enough, can have the same effect on the brain as if actually seeing / doing, a point now used regularly in sports training, et al. Both these points and others helped me immensely through my teen years and into early adulthood to break out of my ""shell"", and minimize the tendency to prejudge outcomes or approach change / the unknown negatively. The fact that his book continues to sell, and that there are several spin-offs, is testimony to the timelessness of these points.",4

I found the author Dr. Maltz to be incredibly insightful and the no nonsense way he delivered the information was rather refreshing. I've read my fair share of ""self help"" books and I can honestly
say that most of them carry on a lot about psychological mumbo jumbo, but NOT this one! Dr Maltz is a serious straight shooter and he really just says it like it is. I found many of the ideas he presented to cause ""ah ha"" moments inside me and the information is also very relevant, even in todays world which at first I thought might be an issue since this book was written many years ago. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a way to better understand their self-image and in essence make it better.
By far my favorite part of the book is the idea he delivers that we don't need to dredge up our past and relive it and ""figure it out"" in order to get over it. He just basically says, forget it, and move on! I LOVED THAT!! It makes me feel free from past baggage that I thought may have been holding me back. Really a great book!

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Best book for self development I've found,"I have been studying psychology for the past 3 years at least, and have delved into topics such as NLP, hypnosis, destructive patterns etc. I have studied each of these topics and more in great depth and detail, and have to say that this book is by far the most treasured possession I own. This book is what I consider to be the answer, the key to all of self development. If you want to accomplish ANYTHING and you are not, there is a reason for it, and this book can help you. If you will read it, and then re-read it, and then re-read it, until you begin to fully understand and comprehend the principles and concepts presented, it will change your life....dramatically.

The book's whole premise is that we all behave not according to how things actually are, but how we perceive them to be. As a result of this, our beliefs can be very skewed, and thus our behavior will be as well. It is the task of this book to teach and instruct the reader in how to recognize irrational beliefs, use rational conscious thought to determine what they want to believe instead, and then use principles such as ""theater in the mind"" and ""acting as if"" to create a new reality experienced by your mind, which will program your self image, and thus create a new objective reality around you.

My personal opinion is that this book contains the key, the solution to any problem you are currently having, which you want to change but don't know how to, or are unsure of where to start. I highly recommend it.",8
Gadgeteer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,"Written decades ago, but still pertinent","Dr. Maltz, originally a face surgeon, came to recognize in his patients a need for a positive self image, which need transcended the physical characteristics that patients wanted improved.

He compares the methodology of achieving a desired improvement in one's self image with that used in the design of modern physical automatic control systems (he uses the term ""Cybernetics"" to describe the servomechanism systems of his day, such as those used in military fire control systems).

The concept is imaginative, and Dr. Maltz uses most of his book to describe various methods for helping change one's self image to the one that is desired, presumably by using negative feedback control to minimize the difference between one's current self image and one's desired self image, similar in concept to how military fire control systems operate.

While the basic ideas presented by Dr. Maltz are intriguing the human brain is so much more complex than the design of a military fire control system that the basic concepts presented must be taken with this important limitation in mind.

The fact that book is still in print after many decades and has sold many millions of copies, however, is a tribute to some validity of Dr. Maltz's basic concepts.",3

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Great book,"I purchased the updated version of this book first (edited by Dan Kennedy), and then bought this one. I would definitely recommend this one, because although Dan Kennedy means well, the updated version just has too much stuff in it, and it's easy to lose sight of the forest for all the trees, so to speak. This book has all the nuts and bolts of psycho cybernetics in it, and you won't need another one if you really study and read it.
If you're really trying to change your life, or a certain habit, or any other kind of personal change, this is the book for you. It's the science of how the mind works - and it's more fundamental than anything by Tony Robbins, The Secret, Hypnosis, and NLP. This book is extravagant and foundational for personal change and I'd recommend it with the highest level I possibly could for everyone. I've bought 5 extra copies, and gave them away to friends and family; that's how impressed I am with it.",9

Reggie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Nothing psycho about ths book,"Not for the novice reader. Psycho-Cybernetics: A new technique for using your subconscious power should not be read in one sitting. You should take time to absorb and personally relate to every page. Do not expect to accept or even understand the subconsciously presented concepts of the human mind. Your first impression of the book will not be your last and most likely it will not even be correct. Share this book with a friend or better yet buy a second book. Compare your concept of the book with someone who has read the book. The book I bought was my gift to a Catholic Priest. He has not spoken to me since I gave him the book.

Sharon Delarose,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Maltz exposes the true power of the mind,"Everything is possible if you believe... the power of the mind is incredible. Amaze yourself. We are capable of so much more than we are taught to believe. If only they taught this in school. This is what we should be teaching our kids. Psychocybernetics doesn't teach you what to think, but HOW to think in such a way that your entire life will be transformed. Improve yourself in any area, sports, your job, your love life, simply by readjusting your approach to the world. Maxwell Maltz exposes the secrets of how powerful our thoughts are. And he offers scientific proof to back it up. Maxwell Maltz tells it better than most anybody else I've read.

I first encountered this book back in the early 80's. I didn't know it then but my life was being transformed into something pretty amazing and this was one of the books that helped me change the entire course of my life. Many books passed thru my hands but this was a keeper. I sent my sister a copy nearly 20 years later in the hopes that she could restart her life in a happier new direction.",2

Phil Saparov,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Life-changing read,"I used the advice presented in this book to bring about major change with great results at least twice.
First, when I sprained my knee and tore my ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament), I used the concept of striving towards a goal and thinking of my physical body as a servo-mechanism to heal myself. Where I got the method of healing is a whole 'nother story. But the concept of driving yourself towards an image of Health instead of trying to get away from disease really helped.

It no longer mattered what exactly was wrong with my knee - whether it was a partial or complete tear, or whether one or two menisci had been torn, and to which degree. The idea was to focus on the solution instead of the problem. It took me about 3 months to get back to living a normal life, where I could dance, run, and even do heavy squats again.

The second time I used this concept was when I had completely exhausted my system as a result of emotionally and physically draining work that I had been doing for a long time and for too many hours per week. At some point, all of a sudden, I got a whole host of physical and emotional problems, the worst of which was a pretty severe case of depression.

I changed my job, and went in for different therapies, some of which helped to a degree. But I attribute most of the success, especially in the emotional part, to Psychocybernetics. You see, different therapists analyzed my condition and tried to heal each of the causes that might have had an ill effect on me. This made me focus too much on the causes, which were the problem, instead of focusing on the solution.

Once again, I armed myself with Psychocybernetics and went to work. It took me about 3-4 months to feel almost 100% again. But the most important thing that I remember was that as soon I started to focus on the image of health and think about all the things I would do as soon as I was better, that's when my healing really took off.

Buy it. Use it.
Best,

Phil Saparov",13

on conscious methods of re-programming yourself, not on any kind of self-hypnosis. There are tons of great and insightful reviews of other editions of this book, and I can't improve on them very much, but I will say that I have at least achieved fewer mental obstacles. I've only been using this method a couple of months, but it is nicer. Some hypnotists recommended to me that I get an older edition of this book, one that has not been messed with by any other additional authors, so I got this one.
It takes time to learn, and even be aware of the negative messages you give yourself, but it's worth it to do it all consciously until it all becomes second nature. I'm still working on it. This book is way better than anything Dale Carnegie ever wrote about positive thinking.",1

Martin Zakostelsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Classic masterpiece still shining,"After reading quite a few self-help and self-examination books, this is the book I was waiting for. Although at first I was quite skeptical because of the age of the book (I though ""Would there be something new for me, would the ideas be still valid?""), after first several pages doubts dissolved and I was entirely caught.

I believe all the reviews have said already enough, so I'll keep my review short. This book has all that I want from it:
- Down-to-earth style without exaggerations. Yet very strong and moving content, explaining how human brain works, what brings us happiness/more life, and how to achieve it.
- Positive :o). Gives reader so much energy into his life.
- No easy-read. Should be read definitely more times than once.

Simply put, this is a must read in the area of self-help/psychology books.

Some of favorite quotes:

""The self-image is changed, for better or worse, not by intellect alone, nor by intellectual knowledge alone, but by ""experiencing."" Wittingly or unwittingly you developed your self-image by your creative experiencing in the past. You can change it by the same method. "" (page x)
""One of the most pleasant thoughts to any human being is the thought that he is needed, that he is important enough to help and add to the happiness of some other human being."" (page 97)

""Since man is a goal striving being, he is functioning naturally and normally when he is oriented toward some positive goal and striving toward some desirable goal. Happiness is a symptom of normal, natural functioning and when man is functioning as a goal-striver, he tends to feel fairly happy, regardless of circumstances."" (page 101)

""Our habits are not accidental, or happenstance. We have them because they fit us. They are consistent with our self-image and our entire personality pattern. When we consciously and deliberately develop new and better habits, our self-image tends to outgrow the old habits and grow into the new pattern. "" (page 108)

""To give the other person credit for being sincere, if mistaken, rather than willful and malicious, can do much to smooth out human relations and bring about better understanding between people. Ask yourself, ""How does this appear--to him?"" ""How does he interpret this situation?"" ""How does he feel about it?"" Try to understand why he might ""act the way he does."""" (page 115)

""Man maintains his balance, poise, and sense of security only as he is moving forward--or seeking. When you think of yourself as having attained the goal, you become static, and you lose the security and equilibrium you had when you were moving towards something. The man who is convinced that he is ""good"" in the absolute sense, not only has no incentive to do better, but he feels insecure because he must defend the sham and pretense."" (page 137)

""Regardless of your feelings, force yourself to mix and mingle with other people. After the first cold plunge, you will find yourself warming up and enjoying it if you persist. Develop some social skill that will add to the happiness of other people: dancing, bridge, playing the piano, tennis, conversation. It is an old psychological axiom that constant exposure to the object of fear immunizes against the fear. As the lonely person continues to force himself into social relations with other human beings--not in a passive way, but as an active contributor--he will gradually find that most people are friendly, and that he is accepted. His shyness and timidity begin to disappear. He feels more comfortable in the presence of other people and with himself. The experience of their acceptance of him enables him to accept himself."" (page 139)

""If responding and reacting to negative feedback does not take us further down the road to our own goal--or serve our ends, then there is no need to respond at all. And, if response of any kind gets us off course, or works against us--then no response is the appropriate response."" (page 199)

""If life adapts itself in so many varied forms to act as a means toward an end, is it not reasonable to assume that if we place ourselves in the sort of goal-situation where more life is needed, that we will receive more life?"" (page 261)",7

Just put your doubts aside and BUY THIS BOOK today.
Right now while you are thinking about it. The sooner you get it, the sooner you will benefit from its simple effective techniques.
Whatever you do, don't put it off for tomorrow. You know you will just forget about it and then it will be a MAJOR OPPORTUNITY LOST.
Just make the simple effort right now to order a copy and you will be buying a lotto ticket that is virtually certain to PAY OFF BIG for you.
It costs [very little money] and if applied even a little bit, it is likely to change your life. How many other things that cost [this little] can you say that about.
The original edition DID change MY life about 10 years ago and I know at least 5 other people who point to this book (and another classic-Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill) as major keys to their personal philosophy and success in life.
This revised edition is even better than the original due to the care put into it by Dan Kennedy, who is keeping Dr. Maltz's work alive for the present generation with this timely update.
I liked it so much I have bought 5 more copies for some great business associates as gifts.

Put the techniques that have made many ordinary people appear to be extraordinary to work for you. You don't have to work harder, you just need to apply these amazing principals to your current methods and your will be so much more effective.
I also highly recommended ""Zero Resistance Selling"" for sales persons as a companion to this book which specializes the same techniques to Sales careers.",9

J. K. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,This book is different`,"It's so easy to see how this book has sold over 30,000,000 copies. I can honestly say that I think this book has ended my search for the ""perfect"" self-help book.
After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to buy this book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I've had the book for one week now and I am already seeing results.
About 3 years ago I entered into the world of sales and all of a sudden I became painfully aware of my self-image or my self-esteem as others call it. I became very self-conscious and started down a slippery slope into the world of negative thinking and emotions that weren't helping me at all.
So I did what any person would do who wants to overcome their limiting beliefs and learn how to overcome negative thinking and I started buying self-help litereature. my library is chocked full of books from all the greats. Well I learned something from all the books that I read, but I just felt there was always something missing. I didn't feel like I had the information that I needed to really turn it all around. I tried ""Affirmations"" etc. with marginal results.
Then I found this book. Maxwell talks about how we act, feel and perform is in direct relation to how we imagine ourselves to be. You may need to read that last sentence again because it's what helped me to start putting it all together. He then gives techniques for changing your self-image and overcoming your negative thinking that really works.
I'm very grateful to Maxwell for writing this book. He really put his heart into it and made a masterpiece!
Please don't make the mistake of not buying this book. It could well be the best money you ever spent! God Bless!",21

I bought the new psycho-cybernetics and am greatly disappointed with it. It tries to be too much, almost like they've tried to add several unrelated ""books"" of unrelated info to psycho-cybernetics. There are stories and additional paragraphs of information that you're not quite sure what to do with and it clouds the original ideas. Anyone can make a book longer with lots of extra info but a nicely summarized and boiled down series of thoughts is difficult to do so get the original because that's what it is; I just ordered the original again and will leave this ""updated"" copy in the hotel I'm staying in right now.",22

LindaT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,A Good Thing Made Even Better,"I heard about the first PSYCHO CYBERNETICS book in the 60's (yes, I am over 21 years old) and when I read it I thought it was wonderful. In fact, I thought that if I only would be able to have one self-help book, it would be this one.
THE NEW PSYCHO CYBERNETICS has taken a good book and made it even better. The masterful editing and adapting by Dan Kennedy is great. It still is done in the voice of the original author, Dr. Maxwell Maltz, but it has up to date examples of people most of us know from this time in history, yet it still includes the examples Dr. Maltz wrote about in his original book.
The theme hasn't changed -- Dr. Maltz claimed that the human mind has a ""servo-mechanism"" which can help us accomplish what we desire, but we must let it do its work once the desire is ""fed into"" the mind. He drew upon his knowledge of the then fledgling work of computers. And now in the 21st century, computers have advanced in an unbelievable manner, and yet the principle behind which they work is still the same; the goal-striving mechanism which works towards its teleological end by negative feedback, correction, and positive feedback.
I have other self help books, but for me, this one is the basis on which all the others are carried out.
I can't recommend it highly enough.",23

N/A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,"Solid, Disciplined ""Self-Improvement"" Book","Unlike many other New Age type books which talks about self-elevating, self-magnificating, self-actualising, self-meditative and all that crap, this book gives some good solid ground rules on creating a strong positive mindset that will help one better oneself with practice.
This book is a modern treatment of Maltz's original book and has made it even more palatable and applicable in daily life. The exercises are simple, straightforward and effective. One just needs to practice.
You're not reading this book to be enlightened to salvation or something (which you can read the Holy Bible for!) but rather, this book prepares your mind to set goals in the daily routine of life. It is about setting goals, and consciously thinking how you could achieve them, letting your subconscious autopilot ""servo-mechanism"" help you on the way there through deliberate practical exercises. This book is even more readable than the original.

Rubin Wald,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Great Update of a Classic!,"Dan Kennedy has done a brilliant job of giving Dr. Maltz's classic text a contemporary feel while remaining true to the original version.
I still have my 1974 Pocket Book edition of Psycho-Cybernetics and its ideas and insights helped me a lot in understanding life and success and how I could control my own destiny.
This updated version is even better! I especially liked the PRESCRIPTION and MENTAL TRAINING EXERCISE boxes that Mr. Kennedy has strategically placed throughout the book. They contain very clear suggestions and practical exercises for living an abundant and fulfilling life. For example, he prescribes keeping a ""success diary"" as a tool for building a stronger self-image. And on page 201, there is an powerful exercise for developing the all important habit of forgiveness.
One of the insights Dr. Maltz gave me that helped clarify my own life journey was his understanding that our unconscious minds cannot distinguish between a real experience and the same experience vividly imagined. Years later I found confirmation for this idea in Quantum Physics.
Nobel Prize winning Physicist Niels Bohr's Complementarity Principle shows us that the mental aspect of an imagined experience is complementary to its physical aspect. Both are equally 'real'. No wonder imagination and visualization are such valuable skills to master for anyone who wants to transform their dreams into physcial reality.
I wonder if Dr. Maltz and Dr. Bohr ever had a conversation!
Dan Kennedy has done a tremendous favor for anyone who wants knowledge and practical applications for being more successful. I applaud his efforts.",38

Ken Nuehs,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Unlocked My Success Mechanism,"As of last night, I finished the most amazing book called Psycho Cybernetics, by Maxwell Maltz. I am proud to say this is the first book that I have completed all the way through in over a year. I bought this book back in 2009 when I was fighting the boredom in Iraq and remember only reading a few chapters. After I learned that it was a recommended reading by some of the leaders in Empower Network, I decided to dust it off and see how the top earners have used this book to unlock their success mechanisms and start living a more fulfilling life.

And boy, I'm glad I did!

This powerful book has provided so much value to my life. I now know the power of imagination and have started to imagine successful outcomes when going through a sales presentation, public speaking presentations, and any areas of my life that I'm not completely comfortable and confident in.

And let me tell you the concepts in Psycho Cybernetics works!

I've had my best month in personal training sales at the gym with over $3,000 in sales in just the first 3 weeks. One sale worth $1,950. My previous best was $1,800 for the full month.

This new edition is, amazingly enough, even better than the original. It's clearer, easier to follow, and even more compelling. I'll always be grateful to the person who recommended this to me when I was 20 years old. Twenty two years later, I'm living a life most people only dream of. I owe it all to my outlook and this book was where I began to make the connection between outlook and happiness and results in life. Essential reading.",390

A User,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Better Than the Original; Max Would Have Been Proud,"Greetings:
Join us at the Psycho-Cybernetics discussion group on [...]
To date, I have bought three hardcover editions of the New Psycho-Cybernetics (NPC): one I gave to a friend, one I take with me to read during the day, and one I keep in my home office to work with on those days when I work at home. I have found it a significant improvement upon the original. (I have used up three paperback versions of the original over the last 10 years.)
I remember when I first read the original version of PC, in around 1990. I thought it was somewhat hokey. I used to be an engineer, and I thought it somewhat strange to try to apply feedback control systems theory to people. We are not machines, after all.
The strange thing, though, was that the system worked for me. Still, I was somewhat embarrassed about the whole thing, so I sort of kept my dabbling to myself.
Then, in the mid-late nineties, I read Fritjof Capra's book, The Web of Life. In that book, Capra talks a lot about systems theory, and he also goes into the history of the original cybernetics group (not Psycho cybernetics, but rather a group of mathematicians, psychologists, biologists, and physicists who collaborated in WWII to create anti-aircraft guns that could effectively track and destroy enemy aircraft). In his discussion, Capra explains that the original cybernetics group's goal was to try to make machines that could do what people and animals do naturally and easily, without conscious thought. They tried to do this, in part, by observing the actions of animals and people. Based on such observation, the group devised the early foundation of what became our modern science of systems control as used in almost every modern electrical/mechanical system.
What Maltz tried to do was take a bit of the science and art of systems control and apply it back to people, in an attempt to improve their functioning. I think one of the original cyberneticists, Norbert Weiner, also tried to do this in his book, The Human Use of Human Beings, but I could be wrong.
Anyway, because Psycho-Cybernetics is based on systems theory, in contrast to other types of ""self help"" or positive thinking books, it recognizes that a person trying to achieve her goals is going to fail, and miss what she is pursuing, probably many times on her way to her destination. Rather than candy coating this fact and suggesting ""positive thinking,"" PC suggests feedback control system oriented techniques to use, deal with, and not be completely stymied by such failures.
It also provides techniques to help one deal with ""drama queen"" co-workers and supervisors who seem to go out of their way to provide damaging negative feedback (e.g., ignoring negative feedback in ch. 11, ""How to Unlock Your Real Personality""), or retarding how fast responds to negative feed back (e.g., delaying the response, as in ch. 12 ""Do It Yourself Tranquilizers that Bring Peace of Mind."").

Now, on to the new version of PC: my own opinion is that it is better than the original. Dan follows the original structure of the PC book, and much of the text is in common. However, Dan has buttressed that text with additional examples taken from the many hours of recordings and reams of Maltz' notes that Dan owns. In addition, Dan also provides many practical examples of the successful application of PC techniques that have arisen since the original version of the book was published in 1960.
Try NPC. If, like me, you have areas in your life where you would like to do better, I think you will find it useful.",48

Susil Manchanayaka,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Understand Yourself,"I bought this book and read it. It is interesting for many reasons. I am a lover of books and I am married to books (metaphorically). Why I say that this book is interesting is that it is life changing. The few dollars I spent on this book is worth and I learnt a lot by reading this book. The chapters are shorter and easy to grasp. Some ideas may be unfamiliar to a novice reader but if you are an experienced and an avid reader, you can get at the gist of the book.

Many people have complexes (psychological) and they struggle to come out of the shell they live in. This book helps you to see the world as it is and you can transform your life with ideas from the book. The ideas in the book are worth remembering and practicing. If you are into understanding the nature of human mentality, behavior and why people do certain things but why they are afraid of doing certain things is interesting. In our lives we undergo numerous pains and we sometimes become depressed and helpless. This book helps anyone to see the world as it is.

The writer is an experienced professional in his field and particularly this book helps one to be motivated, enthusiastic in anything she does and develop confidence. He is a leading scholar and a much respected counselor. I read about his biography on the net and I was very impressed. He is an authority on his subject. I can say that this book is a booster - it boosts your performance. It is light reading.

Maltz takes the reader into an unexplored area of human mentality, how to overcome fears, the basis of fear and personal development. He helps the reader overcome fears. He argues that most of the fears we have are all baseless and unscientific. Fears come out of ignorance. Fears come out of wrong perceptions we have. Fears come out of not being exposed to the world we live in. That is what he says.

The book is pocket sized and you can carry it when you travel. It is like a handbook on personal development. If you have any interest in mentoring, counseling, public speaking or teaching, this is the next book you may consider reading.

I personally like the ideas in the book. The time you may spend will be worth the trouble you take to read this book. The chapters in it are short and run into a couple of pages and at a single sitting you can read a chapter. Make this book a partner in your life. It is worth buying and keeping in your private library. In life one may experience ups and downs. Tribulations in life are part of human existence on this planet. We seek advice from others, counselors, teachers or if you belong to a profession of respect - mentors. This book is a companion mentor. If you are in need of some expert advice, consult this book. Discuss what is in it. It will pay rich dividends.

The final verdict on the book is that it is a book of interesting ideas for us to be human. It is a book that teaches us how to face life. It is a book that teaches us live happily. It is a book that teaches us how to help others in need. My friends, read it. You will soon see a dramatic transformation in your life. It is life changing and mind changing. The contents of the book are to be digested (metaphorically). The ideas in the book by Maltz (the writer) will enlighten you all.

N/A,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,bizzare...,"My big problem with this book is the material that Dan Kennedy added. While it provides useful background and some updated examples, Kennedy weaves it in seemlessly into the old material. What you get is confusion. The first person of Kennedy is mixed in with the first person of Maltz, without being differentiated in any way! So in the same section, you have someone speaking of ""my patients"" in the '40's or '50's, and then the same voice speaking of ""my experiences"" with a Kevin Costner movie or a Michael Jordan anecdote. There is no change in typeface, or paragraph structure to indicate that different people are writing, one long-dead, the other alive and ""editing"" this book. Why didn't Kennedy's editor make him place his commentary separately?
This was enough to spoil most of the usefulness of this edition for me. I suggest noting the boxed exercises that Kennedy includes, which are useful, and then reading the original of the book.",53

Jon Torodash,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,A pioneer in the field still standing strong,"I don't make it a habit to read self-help books, but the off-color fitness guru Matt Furey has made a killing on selling a program based off of Maltz's work, and most other ""motivational speakers"" usually bend a knee in respect to Maltz as a forerunner. So I picked up a cheap used copy and read it cover to cover. The only question I have left is why anyone would bother with any of the other crap. This book effectively condenses the entirety of the self-help field. As far as I can tell, this is as good as it gets by the standards of the genre, is enjoyably accessible to a general audience, and has weathered time's attack on its relevance stunningly well.

Firstly, Maltz had the raw clinical experience necessary to write this kind of book. As a crackerjack plastic surgeon he saw immediately and firsthand the life-changing or life-stalling power of self-image at work in the faces of his patients. (And anyone who scoffs at unorthodox contributors to a research field ought to know that Albert Einstein was working for the Swiss patent office when he submitted the Theory of Special Relativity.) Yet Maltz also admits where exactly the limits of his knowledge lie rather than try to convince the reader of his omniscience.

Secondly, Maltz was receptive to many fundamental tenets of psychology and philosophy and works them into Psycho Cybernetics clearly and without contradiction. Nor does he try to repackage ancient metaphysical hokum with inane and feeble examples.

Thirdly, there are no workshops, special reports, live phone help, or products to buy. (Though I cannot speak for the organization that has cropped up around Maltz's name.) All pretense and exaggeration for marketing purposes seem absent from his book.

Maltz was definitive and unequivocal in his ideas, quick to set a standard and stick to it. He took seriously some very fundamental issues of life and makes clear statements. This book rises high above the haphazard pop philosophy/ethics smeared all over mass media which are either shallow and weak or imperiously stupid. Maltz simply faced the truth of his own convictions. Psycho Cybernetics by no means outlines life management skills as an exact science, but its frank suggestions are intellectually compelling. Overall, the book is worthwhile because Maltz' honest and non-condescending style at least earns your respect, if not your belief.",467

Jay Johnson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Horribly Boring Book,"This book will put you to sleep. Unfortunately I bought it based on all the high reviews. I guess I missed something.

Each chapter seemed to ramble on and on. It is a lengthy book and it seems like a lot of the chapter content was redundant saying the same thing over. The book discusses one's self image, happiness, success and how to evaluate it in life.

The author has a section about SUCCESS (sense of direction, understanding, courage, charity, esteem, self confidence and self acceptance). However each of these bullet points were very basic principles. Same applies to his chapter on FAILURE (frustration, aggressiveness, insecurity, lonliness, uncertainty, resentment and emptiness). Again, very basic material.

For me the last third of the book was more boring than the other two-thirds. It was a hard book to finish being so uninteresting. I can't recommend this book.",6

Christian Rosenkreutz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psycho-Cybernetics - A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life,Outdated psuedo-science,"I consider myself to be pretty open-minded, especially in regards to the potentials of the human mind, but this book actually reads like a laundry list of little ""fixes"" to do with your life, and reads more like a precursor to infomercial formats than to gaining any kind of insight whatsoever.

The author declares right away that he is not a psychologist, but considers himself qualified (and believe me, I am not a fan of the word ""qualified"" by any means) and continues to compare himself to Einstein, Madam Curie, Wright Brothers (should I have to mention all of their minds actually created advances that changes the entire world without question?) all in the preface, before you even get to the table of contents, which I will briefly list a few entries:

""your key to a better life""

""the success mechanism within you""

""first key to success mechanism""

""dehypnotize yourself""

""let your success mechanism work for you""

""habit of happiness""

""success-type personality""

""failure mechanism""

""how to give yourself an emotional facelift""

""do-it-yourself tranquilizers that bring peace of mind""

I won't go any further, although there are more. My problem is that not only is this self-proclaimed ""scientist/psychologist"" coining new terms, he does it in a very QVC way. I am all for understanding the programming we submit ourselves to, and ways to understand the mind, and patterns of thought, however this book is a waste of time, only for the mindless reader that in fact turns off their brain to read this book (the author actually asks you to do that while reading, its in one of the first chapters, right after he tries to convince the reader that ""telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition have been established by scientific laboratory experiments."" That is the actual sentence from page 24. I would be delighted by nothing more than to get ahold of these ""scientific laboratory experiments"" data records to see this for myself. Considering this was written over 45 years ago... well, everyone draws their own conclusions but please save your time and money.",45

The rest is filled with case studies that have bee refuted, ideas that are no longer valid and lots, and lots of God talk. When the author runs up against the wall of lack of evidence he just simply states ""and this is where science runs out so we need to turn to religion"". Instead of posing questions about what needs to come and pondering on the advancements that will be achieved by science he just simply states ""God made you this way now be happy with it."" You wouldn't consult a 2,000 year old medical journal for proper surgical procedures, so why would you try to apply the workings of 2,000 year old brains who thought the earth was flat and rain could be obtained with animal sacrifices and dances to modern brains?

Lee Gillette,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,"You've done it again, Mr. Maltz.","One of the first copies of Maxwell Maltz's book, Psycho-Cybernetics is still, to this day, on my bookshelf.

In 1961, It did much more than just put me on my quest for self-improvement. For the very first time, someone connected the mind to the body and brought home the old, simple adage ... ""Change your Mind and you change your life!""

That was Psycho-Cybernetics. That was the principle of Self Image Psychology ... proven and verified by science itself as an irresistible and powerful no nonsense psychology of happiness and fulfillment.

From there on ... for decades ... everything else that was printed in the Self Help Industry became supporting commentary for the principles in this book.

An now ... the new ""enhanced"" version of Psycho-Cybernetics just arrived. And Yesssss!!! I enjoyed this one as much as the original. If not more so!

Comparing the two, the new authors kept the voice and the insights of the original text intact, integrating only the updates needed for new generations to come to experience and cherish the joy of reading this old, new classic for the first time. And experience it, you will. You cannot do otherwise.

Indeed, it gives me great pleasure to recommend this new version of the book that's been around for over a half century. If you are not among the 35 million+ people who read the older one ... please, do yourself a favor ... get a copy now and read it!

You will find that Psycho-Cybernetics will do it to you, as it did it to us, decades ago. True to its kind, the new Enhanced version of Psycho-Cybernetics is still the only book that scientifically proves the principle of Self Image Psychology and makes it the new foundation for a new century's hope, success and the dream of a better life.

And the beat goes on!",43
Richard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,I've come across and read a lot from people like Jack Canfield,"I've been on a self-help reading kick for about the past year. Between issues in my finances, health, relationships, career, I was being weighed down by it all. I've come across and read a lot from people like Jack Canfield, Joel Osteen, Law of Attraction - Teachings of Abraham, etc. They were all good, uplifting and helpful works in their own right, but something was missing. I was listening to a podcast and the host mentioned this book, which was something I've never heard about - ever or anywhere. I looked it up on Amazon and decided to order it. I am sure glad I did. For me, it brought all of the other ideas, concepts and practices together. Things like affirmations, burning desires, faith, action - they all are great, as long as they're operating in conjunction with the way you see yourself and want to see yourself. This book really stresses the importance of focusing on your self-image, which is something I've found many of the other works glossed over or lacked. It's a good work, laced with some biblical references which aren't overwhelming. If you can spend the money on it, it is certainly a great addition to your library. I've recommended it to everyone.",36
Andrei,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,That which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger... it's just a matter of how you choose to see things.,"One of the best self help books I've ever read... written in the 60's by a plastic surgeon to help those still disfigured after reconstructive surgery get on with life, it will give you skills to accept and be at peace with almost anything life will ever dump on you. Once you read this you will realize how many recent best sellers just regurgitate knowledge and wisdom that was already available 50 years to centuries ago, now for the sake of making a buck.

This was recommended to me back in 1976 when I was 19, has made all the difference in the world, has also made a profound difference to everyone I have ever suggested this to and helped through crisis (and still do now, 2016.) When everyone is running around with their heads cut off you'll be the calm one wondering what the fuss is all about... able to maintain perspective and focused on what's important and needs to be done personally and professionally when either or both worlds seem to be falling in on you... I've more than survived brain damage (more than once) , divorce, career ending disability, cancer, premature death of those closest to me.. things I never expected... and can say that which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger if you happen to have the right set of coping skills in your bag of tricks. When people marvel how I just keep on going and wonder how I do it.... and I say... read this book... Every moment you are alive is a gift, that's why its called the present. be happy, be well... make the most of what you do have.",11
Brian Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Funny name. Great book!," “Creative striving for a goal that is important to you as a result of your own deep felt needs, aspirations and talents (and not the symbols which the ‘Joneses’ expect you to display) brings happiness as well as success because you will be functioning as you were meant to function. Man is by nature a goal-striving being. And because man is ‘built that way’ he is not happy unless he is functioning the way he was made to function—as a goal-striver. Thus true success and true happiness not only go together but each enhances the other.”

“Every human being has been literally ‘engineered for success’ by his Creator. Every human being has access to a power greater than himself.”

~ Maxwell Maltz from Psycho-Cybernetics

Psycho-Cybernetics. Funny name.

Great book! Maxwell Maltz was a world-renowned plastic surgeon who discovered that, while some people’s lives changed dramatically after he altered their appearance through plastic surgery, some people’s lives *didn’t*. He deduced that the primary factor that differentiated these groups was their self-image—not what they saw in the mirror but the images they had of themselves in their MINDS. Cool stuff.

He spent the second half of his career merging this self-image psychology with the then-popular science of “cybernetics”—which studies how things like guided missiles or “servo-mechanisms” hit their targets through a clear goal and constant adjustment of their course.

Here are some of the Big Ideas:

1. Cybernetics - Servo-mechanisms & you.
2. The Success Instinct - We’ve all got it!
3. Imagination - The first key.
4. Dehypnotize Yourself! - Starting now. :)
5. Rational Thought - How to use it.

Here’s to getting our Psycho-Cybernetic on as we set inspired goals, imagine our ideals, take action as we correct inevitable mistakes and practice FEELING our success. :)

Elias,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,"Self Image, the true success book","I have had many obstacles throughout life. The reasons for my obstacles finally dawned upon me through the wise words of Bob Proctor, as he mentioned the self image. He recommended a book on it, by Maxwell Maltz. Anyone who wants to make a change, a true change, this book is for you. If it's losing that weight for real, or getting that confidence, or daring to do amazing & out of the comfort zone things, then as mentioned THIS IS FOR YOU! Changing your self image and having an honest look on your self, will not only improve the quality of your life but those around you as well.

Nafiz Elgun,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,The best self book on mindset EVER!,"This book was recommended by a millionaire mentor of mine. This book has already started to help me immensely turn my brain and thoughts into an asset instead of it being a battlefield of negative thoughts and having the self image of myself as being unworthy and not believing in myself.

I remember reading reviews for this book only 2 months ago and trying to convince myself not to take the plunge despite all of the people saying this book changed their life.

Well...it was one of the best decisions I have made. And i confidently know I will use the practices in this book for the rest of my life to be a happy, confident, and strong goal-attacking person. Dr. Maltz's guidance is already starting to ring in my head almost daily.

I value the mental benefits of this book in the thousands honestly.

Just get it. Start. Do the practice exercises. Don't be judgmental of it and it will work for you.",2
WWF,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Salesmen and sports,"This Dan Kennedy revision of Maxwell Maltz's original Pscyho-cybernetics is in my opinion so geared towards salesmen and sports that if you're not a salesman, athlete, sports fan or an avid golfer, the text can be hard to get through. Sadly, Maltz's original version of Psycho-cybernetics is not offered as a Kindle book, which is why I bought this one.
Maltz's original, which I read as a teenager in the 70s, also featured athletes and salespeople, but Maltz was more inclusive in his approach. This new version should be entitled something like ""Psycho-cybernetics for Salesmen and Sports."" Salesmen and sports are great and important, but potential readers should at least be given some indication that Kennedy has taken Maltz's book so heavily in that direction so that they can decide whether or not it's really for them.",13
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Top 10 of all time.,"This is one of those few books that put forth a new idea that has not only stood the test of time but has been woven into the fabric of the entire self development industry. It's up there with ""Think and Grow Rich"" and "" How to win friends and influence people"".

It starts slow and after 2 or 3 chapters I was beginning to question the purchase. ""There is nothing to DO"" I thought. Then after it got going I felt there was TOO MUCH to do. Lots of excersises.

Of course, like so many things, the crux is in the application. Will you use it?

I think the thing I liked best is that you can really hear Dr Maltzs' passion for humanity and sincere desire to help. He seems like a wonderful man.

Also that he isn't in the pie-in-the-sky ""anyone can do anything"" camp. He teaches us to be truthful about our actual limitations, which do have limits, but are far above what most people do or even aspire to.

I put this on a short Must Read list of a handful of classics and consider it a must for anyone pursuing their full potential.

a_man,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Unlock your personality,"I stumbled upon this book by accident, having read a profound article that mentioned this book as one of its sources. I bough this book for less than 10 dollars and I must say, this is one of the best investments I have ever made. Easy to read, this book's ideas MAKE SENSE and are profound. I'd like to save my biggest reviews for one chapter only: Unlock your personality. I read this chapter at time when I was depressed, because I didn't get along with people too well. I was reserved, shy and was a social dud. My entire college years, I've been a social dud. My social life sucked. It sucked because I didn't know how to get along with people - I was irritable with people and might have appeared mean to many. The chapter: Unlock your personality might have changed my life. To follow the chapter and its advices precisely requires faith in yourself. A great leap indeed. Don't think, says the late Dr. Maltz -and act. Thinking only complicates things further. Don't think, don't over analyze yourself and just BE. It might as well be a magic bullet. It was for me, I think. Read that chapter over, and over, and over and it will eventually click. Be yourself is the message - and don't think. In social situations, don't think - and just be. Just be. Read the chapter, and you will understand what I mean. ;)",14

Guillermo Velez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Worth the try for the cost,"Facts: It rook me months to do a decent job to relax and use the techniques described in the book. More than one reading and reading into details were necessary for me to grasp the right way to visualize what I wanted. The essentials of the book probably could me summarized in one chapter but the book includes a lot of examples, typical of this type of books. I did not achieve much the first couple of months on my first goal of reach my ideal weight. Then, my wife got me into a weight loss program and now I am well on my way to reach my goal. I keep doing the relaxation and visualization of reaching my ideal weight.

Opinion: I seek for a way to ""program"" the subconscious for a long time and this is the closest thing I have found. I started with a goal and the right tool just came along and I do not believe in coincidences. The weight loss program is making me loss weight. The techniques described in the book makes me follow the program with a very high level of discipline. The desire to reach my target weight is so high that I am able to sort almost all challenges I face to deviate from the weight loss program. I think that for the cost of the book is worth the try if you believe that you are a person of habit, that you behavior is ruled by your subconscious and you need to program that subconscious mind to change your behavior and achieve your goal",1

enya1978,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,A Book Ahead of its Time (and Ours),"This is the only book you need to read to be happy. I want to thank Mr. Maltz for this book, and express my regret that I did not find it when I was like, 12.

I knew it was a good book the minute I read ""You are not inferior. You are not superior. You are YOU"". I knew it was a good book when I read about how Maltz dismisses obtaining positive self image through ""willpower"". How many of you have heard well-meaning friends and coworkers say ""think positive"" about something that troubles you? How many of you have wondered why this well-meaning advice seldom helps? Maltz hits the nail on the head when he tells, and illustrates, why willpower and forcing positive thoughts into your head does not work. AND....he specifically tells you how to change your thought process so the positive thoughts come naturally. He gives you simple (but important) exercises to help you obtain and use the concepts he teaches.

I am a firm believe that once you have a positive image, life seems to turn out better. Not only does it look better through clear (instead of mud-shaded) glasses....but your new found self image will help you get the things you want. It will give you the power to go after what you want because you finally feel worthy. Instead of brainwashings and piecemeal advice, Maltz lays a solid groundwork using pure logic as to why YOU are worthy, and how you can convince yourself of this fact. He even gives concrete visuals to aid his lessons (healing emotional scars, much like facial scars). Emotional facelift.

This man is a genius. Do yourself a huge favor, buy this book and read it. Then read it again.",5

The sooner in life you can get these perspectives, the better for you and your loved ones. The theme in each chapter tends to develop somewhat slowly. Maltz tends to gather various points, from many different authors and sources, and takes some pages so that they coalesce into very significant and meaningful approaches to life that have immense practical value. And this is a workbook, meant to be used as a guide for your own personal work, which we all need to do very much of. Just reading it quickly through and moving on to the next book would be a huge waste.

I personally found much of the material to be ... not dense ... but dry. I hate to say that because Maltz is clearly such an intelligent man with an important message and helpful advice. But, it is true, in my opinion.

J,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,one of the most powerful books you will ever read,"honestly, quit wasting your money on cheesy current generation self help books like ""the secret"" or ""the power of now"". i'm only 26 and this book has helped me profoundly, increased my levels of happiness, self confidence, pretty much curbed my general anxiety levels, and has me looking at life from a whole new perspective. the author maxwell maltz wrote a book like this from the bottom of his heart, and you feel how contagious it is coming off the pages. i also have it on audiobook and listen to it going to and from work. it makes a difference trust me, because i NEVER write book reviews on amazon. i've only read it three times in the past month since i've had it and am now reading ""zero resistance selling"" by the same author and will also be purchasing ""zero resistance living"", the 90 day program, from the psycho-cybernetics.com site. if you want to understand why you act the way you do, why you perceive yourself the way you do, how you can gradually change that and KEEP it that way, and have plenty of aha moments about yourself, get this book. don't misunderstand, you will have to put in the work like anything else in life, but you WILL end up recommending it to everyone you know after you read it, believe me. my mom and my brother have now both read it and have both wondered why they didn't stumble upon this sooner, and they are practically non-readers. you are worth it, get on this already.",5
Mr H,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,A great book.,"Before ""The Law Of Attraction"", there was simply this book. It works because it uses the same principles and it shows you how to make it work for you.

A great book.",1
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Still A Great Book,"I originally read this as a condensed book in Reader's Digest magazine back in the early 1960's, and then bought the book itself. After several moves, it was lost. I recently repurchased it due to it's past impact on my thinking. A primary point that the late Dr. Maltz emphasized was his observation that plastic surgery had unexpected results with different people. For some, a minor correction caused a major personality change for the better. For others, even where the cosmetic change was more pronounced, the person's personality changed little, if at all. He attributed this to the person's innner / self image. Another key point was the power of visualization, that, if vivid / realistic enough, can have the same effect on the brain as if actually seeing / doing, a point now used regularly in sports training, et al. Both these points and others helped me immensely through my teen years and into early adulthood to break out of my ""shell"", and minimize the tendency to prejudge outcomes or approach change / the unknown negatively. The fact that his book continues to sell, and that there are several spin-offs, is testimony to the timelessness of these points.",4

Shantel Ruiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Straight Shooter,"In an effort to understand why I have a strong tendency to ""doubt"" myself in many situations where I rationally know I excel, I bought this book and read it cover to cover.
I found the author Dr. Maltz to be incredibly insightful and the no nonsense way he delivered the information was rather refreshing. I've read my fair share of ""self help"" books and I can honestly
say that most of them carry on a lot about psychological mumbo jumbo, but NOT this one! Dr Maltz is a serious straight shooter and he really just says it like it is. I found many of the ideas he presented to cause ""ah ha"" moments inside me and the information is also very relevant, even in todays world which at first I thought might be an issue since this book was written many years ago. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a way to better understand their self-image and in essence make it better.
By far my favorite part of the book is the idea he delivers that we don't need to dredge up our past and relive it and ""figure it out"" in order to get over it. He just basically says, forget it, and move on! I LOVED THAT!! It makes me feel free from past baggage that I thought may have been holding me back. Really a great book!
If i had to say something negative, it would be that the font was kind of small ;)",3

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Best book for self development I've found,"I have been studying psychology for the past 3 years at least, and have delved into topics such as NLP, hypnosis, destructive patterns etc. I have studied each of these topics and more in great depth and detail, and have to say that this book is by far the most treasured possession I own. This book is what I consider to be the answer, the key to all of self development. If you want to accomplish ANYTHING and you are not, there is a reason for it, and this book can help you. If you will read it, and then re-read it, and then re-read it, until you begin to fully understand and comprehend the principles and concepts presented, it will change your life....dramatically.

The book's whole premise is that we all behave not according to how things actually are, but how we perceive them to be. As a result of this, our beliefs can be very skewed, and thus our behavior will be as well. It is the task of this book to teach and instruct the reader in how to recognize irrational beliefs, use rational conscious thought to determine what they want to believe instead, and then use principles such as ""theater in the mind"" and ""acting as if"" to create a new reality experienced by your mind, which will program your self image, and thus create a new objective reality around you.

My personal opinion is that this book contains the key, the solution to any problem you are currently having, which you want to change but don't know how to, or are unsure of where to start. I highly recommend it.",8
Gadgeteer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,"Written decades ago, but still pertinent","Dr. Maltz, originally a face surgeon, came to recognize in his patients a need for a positive self image, which need transcended the physical characteristics that patients wanted improved.

He compares the methodology of achieving a desired improvement in one's self image with that used in the design of modern physical automatic control systems (he uses the term ""Cybernetics"" to describe the servomechanism systems of his day, such as those used in military fire control systems).

The concept is imaginative, and Dr. Maltz uses most of his book to describe various methods for helping change one's self image to the one that is desired, presumably by using negative feedback control to minimize the difference between one's current self image and one's desired self image, similar in concept to how military fire control systems operate.

While the basic ideas presented by Dr. Maltz are intriguing the human brain is so much more complex than the design of a military fire control system that the basic concepts presented must be taken with this important limitation in mind.

The fact that book is still in print after many decades and has sold many millions of copies, however, is a tribute to some validity of Dr. Maltz's basic concepts.",3

Nate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Great book,"I purchased the updated version of this book first (edited by Dan Kennedy), and then bought this one. I would definitely recommend this one, because although Dan Kennedy means well, the updated version just has too much stuff in it, and it's easy to lose sight of the forest for all the trees, so to speak. This book has all the nuts and bolts of psycho cybernetics in it, and you won't need another one if you really study and read it.
If you're really trying to change your life, or a certain habit, or any other kind of personal change, this is the book for you. It's the science of how the mind works - and it's more fundamental than anything by Tony Robbins, The Secret, Hypnosis, and NLP.

Psychocybernetics doesn't teach you what to think, but HOW to think in such a way that your entire life will be transformed. Improve yourself in any area, sports, your job, your love life, simply by readjusting your approach to the world. Maxwell Maltz exposes the secrets of how powerful our thoughts are. And he offers scientific proof to back it up. Maxwell Maltz tells it better than most anybody else I've read.

I first encountered this book back in the early 80's. I didn't know it then but my life was being transformed into something pretty amazing and this was one of the books that helped me change the entire course of my life.

Phil Saparov,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Life-changing read,"I used the advice presented in this book to bring about major change with great results at least twice.
First, when I sprained my knee and tore my ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament), I used the concept of striving towards a goal and thinking of my physical body as a servo-mechanism to heal myself. Where I got the method of healing is a whole 'nother story. But the concept of driving yourself towards an image of Health instead of trying to get away from disease really helped.

It no longer mattered what exactly was wrong with my knee - whether it was a partial or complete tear, or whether one or two menisci had been torn, and to which degree. The idea was to focus on the solution instead of the problem. It took me about 3 months to get back to living a normal life, where I could dance, run, and even do heavy squats again.

The second time I used this concept was when I had completely exhausted my system as a result of emotionally and physically draining work that I had been doing for a long time and for too many hours per week. At some point, all of a sudden, I got a whole host of physical and emotional problems, the worst of which was a pretty severe case of depression.

I changed my job, and went in for different therapies, some of which helped to a degree. But I attribute most of the success, especially in the emotional part, to Psychocybernetics. You see, different therapists analyzed my condition and tried to heal each of the causes that might have had an ill effect on me. This made me focus too much on the causes, which were the problem, instead of focusing on the solution.

Once again, I armed myself with Psychocybernetics and went to work. It took me about 3-4 months to feel almost 100% again. But the most important thing that I remember was that as soon I started to focus on the image of health and think about all the things I would do as soon as I was better, that's when my healing really took off.

Buy it. Use it.
Best,

Phil Saparov",13

I've only been using this method a couple of months, but it is nicer. Some hypnotists recommended to me that I get an older edition of this book, one that has not been messed with by any other additional authors, so I got this one.

Reynaldo Vasquez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Five Stars,Love this book! It is now one of my right living text books!,1
Martin Zakostelsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Classic masterpiece still shining,"After reading quite a few self-help and self-examination books, this is the book I was waiting for. Although at first I was quite skeptical because of the age of the book (I though ""Would there be something new for me, would the ideas be still valid?""), after first several pages doubts dissolved and I was entirely caught.

I believe all the reviews have said already enough, so I'll keep my review short. This book has all that I want from it:
- Down-to-earth style without exaggerations. Yet very strong and moving content, explaining how human brain works, what brings us happiness/more life, and how to achieve it.
- Positive :o). Gives reader so much energy into his life.
- No easy-read. Should be read definitely more times than once.

Simply put, this is a must read in the area of self-help/psychology books.

Some of favorite quotes:

""The self-image is changed, for better or worse, not by intellect alone, nor by intellectual knowledge alone, but by ""experiencing."" Wittingly or unwittingly you developed your self-image by your creative experiencing in the past. You can change it by the same method. "" (page x)
""One of the most pleasant thoughts to any human being is the thought that he is needed, that he is important enough to help and add to the happiness of some other human being."" (page 97)

""Since man is a goal striving being, he is functioning naturally and normally when he is oriented toward some positive goal and striving toward some desirable goal. Happiness is a symptom of normal, natural functioning and when man is functioning as a goal-striver, he tends to feel fairly happy, regardless of circumstances."" (page 101)

""Our habits are not accidental, or happenstance. We have them because they fit us. They are consistent with our self-image and our entire personality pattern. When we consciously and deliberately develop new and better habits, our self-image tends to outgrow the old habits and grow into the new pattern. "" (page 108)

""To give the other person credit for being sincere, if mistaken, rather than willful and malicious, can do much to smooth out human relations and bring about better understanding between people. Ask yourself, ""How does this appear--to him?"" ""How does he interpret this situation?"" ""How does he feel about it?"" Try to understand why he might ""act the way he does."""" (page 115)

""Man maintains his balance, poise, and sense of security only as he is moving forward--or seeking. When you think of yourself as having attained the goal, you become static, and you lose the security and equilibrium you had when you were moving towards something. The man who is convinced that he is ""good"" in the absolute sense, not only has no incentive to do better, but he feels insecure because he must defend the sham and pretense."" (page 137)

""Regardless of your feelings, force yourself to mix and mingle with other people. After the first cold plunge, you will find yourself warming up and enjoying it if you persist. Develop some social skill that will add to the happiness of other people: dancing, bridge, playing the piano, tennis, conversation. It is an old psychological axiom that constant exposure to the object of fear immunizes against the fear. As the lonely person continues to force himself into social relations with other human beings--not in a passive way, but as an active contributor--he will gradually find that most people are friendly, and that he is accepted. His shyness and timidity begin to disappear. He feels more comfortable in the presence of other people and with himself. The experience of their acceptance of him enables him to accept himself."" (page 139)

""If responding and reacting to negative feedback does not take us further down the road to our own goal--or serve our ends, then there is no need to respond at all. And, if response of any kind gets us off course, or works against us--then no response is the appropriate response."" (page 199)

""If life adapts itself in so many varied forms to act as a means toward an end, is it not reasonable to assume that if we place ourselves in the sort of goal-situation where more life is needed, that we will receive more life?"" (page 261)",7

Just put your doubts aside and BUY THIS BOOK today.
Right now while you are thinking about it. The sooner you get it, the sooner you will benefit from its simple effective techniques.
Whatever you do, don't put it off for tomorrow. You know you will just forget about it and then it will be a MAJOR OPPORTUNITY LOST.
Just make the simple effort right now to order a copy and you will be buying a lotto ticket that is virtually certain to PAY OFF BIG for you.
It costs [very little money] and if applied even a little bit, it is likely to change your life. How many other things that cost [this little] can you say that about.
The original edition DID change MY life about 10 years ago and I know at least 5 other people who point to this book (and another classic-Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill) as major keys to their personal philosophy and success in life.
This revised edition is even better than the original due to the care put into it by Dan Kennedy, who is keeping Dr. Maltz's work alive for the present generation with this timely update.
I liked it so much I have bought 5 more copies for some great business associates as gifts.

Put the techniques that have made many ordinary people appear to be extraordinary to work for you. You don't have to work harder, you just need to apply these amazing principals to your current methods and your will be so much more effective.
I also highly recommended ""Zero Resistance Selling"" for sales persons as a companion to this book which specializes the same techniques to Sales careers.",9

J. K. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,This book is different`,"It's so easy to see how this book has sold over 30,000,000 copies. I can honestly say that I think this book has ended my search for the ""perfect"" self-help book.
After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to buy this book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I've had the book for one week now and I am already seeing results.
About 3 years ago I entered into the world of sales and all of a sudden I became painfully aware of my self-image or my self-esteem as others call it. I became very self-conscious and started down a slippery slope into the world of negative thinking and emotions that weren't helping me at all.
So I did what any person would do who wants to overcome their limiting beliefs and learn how to overcome negative thinking and I started buying self-help litereature. my library is chocked full of books from all the greats. Well I learned something from all the books that I read, but I just felt there was always something missing. I didn't feel like I had the information that I needed to really turn it all around. I tried ""Affirmations"" etc. with marginal results.
Then I found this book. Maxwell talks about how we act, feel and perform is in direct relation to how we imagine ourselves to be. You may need to read that last sentence again because it's what helped me to start putting it all together. He then gives techniques for changing your self-image and overcoming your negative thinking that really works.
I'm very grateful to Maxwell for writing this book. He really put his heart into it and made a masterpiece!
Please don't make the mistake of not buying this book. It could well be the best money you ever spent! God Bless!",21

LindaT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,A Good Thing Made Even Better,"I heard about the first PSYCHO CYBERNETICS book in the 60's (yes, I am over 21 years old) and when I read it I thought it was wonderful. In fact, I thought that if I only would be able to have one self-help book, it would be this one.
THE NEW PSYCHO CYBERNETICS has taken a good book and made it even better. The masterful editing and adapting by Dan Kennedy is great. It still is done in the voice of the original author, Dr. Maxwell Maltz, but it has up to date examples of people most of us know from this time in history, yet it still includes the examples Dr. Maltz wrote about in his original book.
The theme hasn't changed -- Dr. Maltz claimed that the human mind has a ""servo-mechanism"" which can help us accomplish what we desire, but we must let it do its work once the desire is ""fed into"" the mind. He drew upon his knowledge of the then fledgling work of computers. And now in the 21st century, computers have advanced in an unbelievable manner, and yet the principle behind which they work is still the same; the goal-striving mechanism which works towards its teleological end by negative feedback, correction, and positive feedback.
I have other self help books, but for me, this one is the basis on which all the others are carried out.
I can't recommend it highly enough.",23

This book is a modern treatment of Maltz's original book and has made it even more palatable and applicable in daily life. The exercises are simple, straightforward and effective. One just needs to practice.
You're not reading this book to be enlightened to salvation or something (which you can read the Holy Bible for!) but rather, this book prepares your mind to set goals in the daily routine of life. It is about setting goals, and consciously thinking how you could achieve them, letting your subconscious autopilot ""servo-mechanism"" help you on the way there through deliberate practical exercises. This book is even more readable than the original.
Very readable, very practical, and no ""mind power"" mystical nonsense. Just straight cut practical tips to sharpen the mind.",12
Ramon Acosta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,The first and foremost,"Without a doubt, Dr. Maltz' classic is still on top of the heap of self-help books, tapes and seminars available. Everything that was relevant in late 1950 and early 1960 is still relevant today. Unless humans fundamentally change the way the brain operates, this book will be a classic text on the process of communicating with and reprogramming the inner self.

There's only one downside about this book. If you don't try the mental techniques, nothing will change. You might manufacture a new line of thinking after absorbing the material, but if you don't practice and apply it on a near daily basis, then you've merely read one of the greatest psychology texts of all time. A bit of mental elbow grease will instead allow you to experience this book and the profound change you and your loved ones can all potentially benefit from.",7

Rubin Wald,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Great Update of a Classic!,"Dan Kennedy has done a brilliant job of giving Dr. Maltz's classic text a contemporary feel while remaining true to the original version.
I still have my 1974 Pocket Book edition of Psycho-Cybernetics and its ideas and insights helped me a lot in understanding life and success and how I could control my own destiny.
This updated version is even better! I especially liked the PRESCRIPTION and MENTAL TRAINING EXERCISE boxes that Mr. Kennedy has strategically placed throughout the book. They contain very clear suggestions and practical exercises for living an abundant and fulfilling life. For example, he prescribes keeping a ""success diary"" as a tool for building a stronger self-image. And on page 201, there is an powerful exercise for developing the all important habit of forgiveness.
One of the insights Dr. Maltz gave me that helped clarify my own life journey was his understanding that our unconscious minds cannot distinguish between a real experience and the same experience vividly imagined. Years later I found confirmation for this idea in Quantum Physics.
Nobel Prize winning Physicist Niels Bohr's Complementarity Principle shows us that the mental aspect of an imagined experience is complementary to its physical aspect. Both are equally 'real'. No wonder imagination and visualization are such valuable skills to master for anyone who wants to transform their dreams into physcial reality.
I wonder if Dr. Maltz and Dr. Bohr ever had a conversation!
Dan Kennedy has done a tremendous favor for anyone who wants knowledge and practical applications for being more successful. I applaud his efforts.",38

I am proud to say this is the first book that I have completed all the way through in over a year. I bought this book back in 2009 when I was fighting the boredom in Iraq and remember only reading a few chapters. After I learned that it was a recommended reading by some of the leaders in Empower Network, I decided to dust it off and see how the top earners have used this book to unlock their success mechanisms and start living a more fulfilling life.

And boy, I'm glad I did!

This powerful book has provided so much value to my life. I now know the power of imagination and have started to imagine successful outcomes when going through a sales presentation, public speaking presentations, and any areas of my life that I'm not completely comfortable and confident in.

And let me tell you the concepts in Psycho Cybernetics works!

I've had my best month in personal training sales at the gym with over $3,000 in sales in just the first 3 weeks. One sale worth $1,950. My previous best was $1,800 for the full month.

This new edition is, amazingly enough, even better than the original. It's clearer, easier to follow, and even more compelling. I'll always be grateful to the person who recommended this to me when I was 20 years old. Twenty two years later, I'm living a life most people only dream of. I owe it all to my outlook and this book was where I began to make the connection between outlook and happiness and results in life. Essential reading.",390

A User,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Better Than the Original; Max Would Have Been Proud,"Greetings:
Join us at the Psycho-Cybernetics discussion group on [...]
To date, I have bought three hardcover editions of the New Psycho-Cybernetics (NPC): one I gave to a friend, one I take with me to read during the day, and one I keep in my home office to work with on those days when I work at home. I have found it a significant improvement upon the original. (I have used up three paperback versions of the original over the last 10 years.)
I remember when I first read the original version of PC, in around 1990. I thought it was somewhat hokey. I used to be an engineer, and I thought it somewhat strange to try to apply feedback control systems theory to people. We are not machines, after all.
The strange thing, though, was that the system worked for me. Still, I was somewhat embarrassed about the whole thing, so I sort of kept my dabbling to myself.
Then, in the mid-late nineties, I read Fritjof Capra's book, The Web of Life. In that book, Capra talks a lot about systems theory, and he also goes into the history of the original cybernetics group (not Psycho cybernetics, but rather a group of mathematicians, psychologists, biologists, and physicists who collaborated in WWII to create anti-aircraft guns that could effectively track and destroy enemy aircraft). In his discussion, Capra explains that the original cybernetics group's goal was to try to make machines that could do what people and animals do naturally and easily, without conscious thought. They tried to do this, in part, by observing the actions of animals and people. Based on such observation, the group devised the early foundation of what became our modern science of systems control as used in almost every modern electrical/mechanical system.
What Maltz tried to do was take a bit of the science and art of systems control and apply it back to people, in an attempt to improve their functioning. I think one of the original cyberneticists, Norbert Weiner, also tried to do this in his book, The Human Use of Human Beings, but I could be wrong.
Anyway, because Psycho-Cybernetics is based on systems theory, in contrast to other types of ""self help"" or positive thinking books, it recognizes that a person trying to achieve her goals is going to fail, and miss what she is pursuing, probably many times on her way to her destination. Rather than candy coating this fact and suggesting ""positive thinking,"" PC suggests feedback control system oriented techniques to use, deal with, and not be completely stymied by such failures.
It also provides techniques to help one deal with ""drama queen"" co-workers and supervisors who seem to go out of their way to provide damaging negative feedback (e.g., ignoring negative feedback in ch. 11, ""How to Unlock Your Real Personality""), or retarding how fast responds to negative feed back (e.g., delaying the response, as in ch. 12 ""Do It Yourself Tranquilizers that Bring Peace of Mind."").

Now, on to the new version of PC: my own opinion is that it is better than the original. Dan follows the original structure of the PC book, and much of the text is in common. However, Dan has buttressed that text with additional examples taken from the many hours of recordings and reams of Maltz' notes that Dan owns. In addition, Dan also provides many practical examples of the successful application of PC techniques that have arisen since the original version of the book was published in 1960.
Try NPC. If, like me, you have areas in your life where you would like to do better, I think you will find it useful.",48

Picklegirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,This book was recommended...,"If you are familiar with the writings of Jane Roberts who channeled an entity called Seth, there is a set of books called the deleted sessions.

It's apparent that this book was written before drugs were prevelant in our society because there's no outlandish statements, no grey area, and it's actually down to earth and makes sense. If you lack confidence, or have a low self opion, this is by far the best self help book available...buy it.",11

Get this book it will change your life and the way you think. You want to change your life start working on changing the way you think.,1
Susil Manchanayaka,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Understand Yourself,"I bought this book and read it. It is interesting for many reasons. I am a lover of books and I am married to books (metaphorically). Why I say that this book is interesting is that it is life changing. The few dollars I spent on this book is worth and I learnt a lot by reading this book. The chapters are shorter and easy to grasp. Some ideas may be unfamiliar to a novice reader but if you are an experienced and an avid reader, you can get at the gist of the book.

Many people have complexes (psychological) and they struggle to come out of the shell they live in. This book helps you to see the world as it is and you can transform your life with ideas from the book. The ideas in the book are worth remembering and practicing. If you are into understanding the nature of human mentality, behavior and why people do certain things but why they are afraid of doing certain things is interesting. In our lives we undergo numerous pains and we sometimes become depressed and helpless. This book helps anyone to see the world as it is.

The writer is an experienced professional in his field and particularly this book helps one to be motivated, enthusiastic in anything she does and develop confidence. He is a leading scholar and a much respected counselor. I read about his biography on the net and I was very impressed. He is an authority on his subject. I can say that this book is a booster - it boosts your performance. It is light reading.

Maltz takes the reader into an unexplored area of human mentality, how to overcome fears, the basis of fear and personal development. He helps the reader overcome fears. He argues that most of the fears we have are all baseless and unscientific. Fears come out of ignorance. Fears come out of wrong perceptions we have. Fears come out of not being exposed to the world we live in. That is what he says.

The book is pocket sized and you can carry it when you travel. It is like a handbook on personal development. If you have any interest in mentoring, counseling, public speaking or teaching, this is the next book you may consider reading.

I personally like the ideas in the book. The time you may spend will be worth the trouble you take to read this book. The chapters in it are short and run into a couple of pages and at a single sitting you can read a chapter. Make this book a partner in your life. It is worth buying and keeping in your private library. In life one may experience ups and downs. Tribulations in life are part of human existence on this planet. We seek advice from others, counselors, teachers or if you belong to a profession of respect - mentors. This book is a companion mentor. If you are in need of some expert advice, consult this book. Discuss what is in it. It will pay rich dividends.

The final verdict on the book is that it is a book of interesting ideas for us to be human. It is a book that teaches us how to face life. It is a book that teaches us live happily. It is a book that teaches us how to help others in need. My friends, read it. You will soon see a dramatic transformation in your life. It is life changing and mind changing. The contents of the book are to be digested (metaphorically). The ideas in the book by Maltz (the writer) will enlighten you all.

N/A,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,bizzare...,"My big problem with this book is the material that Dan Kennedy added. While it provides useful background and some updated examples, Kennedy weaves it in seemlessly into the old material. What you get is confusion. The first person of Kennedy is mixed in with the first person of Maltz, without being differentiated in any way! So in the same section, you have someone speaking of ""my patients"" in the '40's or '50's, and then the same voice speaking of ""my experiences"" with a Kevin Costner movie or a Michael Jordan anecdote. There is no change in typeface, or paragraph structure to indicate that different people are writing, one long-dead, the other alive and ""editing"" this book. Why didn't Kennedy's editor make him place his commentary separately?
This was enough to spoil most of the usefulness of this edition for me. I suggest noting the boxed exercises that Kennedy includes, which are useful, and then reading the original of the book.",53

Jon Torodash,5.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,A pioneer in the field still standing strong,"I don't make it a habit to read self-help books, but the off-color fitness guru Matt Furey has made a killing on selling a program based off of Maltz's work, and most other ""motivational speakers"" usually bend a knee in respect to Maltz as a forerunner. So I picked up a cheap used copy and read it cover to cover. The only question I have left is why anyone would bother with any of the other crap. This book effectively condenses the entirety of the self-help field. As far as I can tell, this is as good as it gets by the standards of the genre, is enjoyably accessible to a general audience, and has weathered time's attack on its relevance stunningly well.

Firstly, Maltz had the raw clinical experience necessary to write this kind of book. As a crackerjack plastic surgeon he saw immediately and firsthand the life-changing or life-stalling power of self-image at work in the faces of his patients. (And anyone who scoffs at unorthodox contributors to a research field ought to know that Albert Einstein was working for the Swiss patent office when he submitted the Theory of Special Relativity.) Yet Maltz also admits where exactly the limits of his knowledge lie rather than try to convince the reader of his omniscience.

Secondly, Maltz was receptive to many fundamental tenets of psychology and philosophy and works them into Psycho Cybernetics clearly and without contradiction. Nor does he try to repackage ancient metaphysical hokum with inane and feeble examples.

Thirdly, there are no workshops, special reports, live phone help, or products to buy. (Though I cannot speak for the organization that has cropped up around Maltz's name.) All pretense and exaggeration for marketing purposes seem absent from his book.

Maltz was definitive and unequivocal in his ideas, quick to set a standard and stick to it. He took seriously some very fundamental issues of life and makes clear statements. This book rises high above the haphazard pop philosophy/ethics smeared all over mass media which are either shallow and weak or imperiously stupid. Maltz simply faced the truth of his own convictions. Psycho Cybernetics by no means outlines life management skills as an exact science, but its frank suggestions are intellectually compelling. Overall, the book is worthwhile because Maltz' honest and non-condescending style at least earns your respect, if not your belief.",467

Each chapter seemed to ramble on and on. It is a lengthy book and it seems like a lot of the chapter content was redundant saying the same thing over. The book discusses one's self image, happiness, success and how to evaluate it in life.

The author has a section about SUCCESS (sense of direction, understanding, courage, charity, esteem, self confidence and self acceptance). However each of these bullet points were very basic principles. Same applies to his chapter on FAILURE (frustration, aggressiveness, insecurity, lonliness, uncertainty, resentment and emptiness). Again, very basic material.

Christian Rosenkreutz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,Outdated psuedo-science,"I consider myself to be pretty open-minded, especially in regards to the potentials of the human mind, but this book actually reads like a laundry list of little ""fixes"" to do with your life, and reads more like a precursor to infomercial formats than to gaining any kind of insight whatsoever.

The author declares right away that he is not a psychologist, but considers himself qualified (and believe me, I am not a fan of the word ""qualified"" by any means) and continues to compare himself to Einstein, Madam Curie, Wright Brothers (should I have to mention all of their minds actually created advances that changes the entire world without question?) all in the preface, before you even get to the table of contents, which I will briefly list a few entries:

""your key to a better life""

""the success mechanism within you""

""first key to success mechanism""

""dehypnotize yourself""

""let your success mechanism work for you""

""habit of happiness""

""success-type personality""

""failure mechanism""

""how to give yourself an emotional facelift""

""do-it-yourself tranquilizers that bring peace of mind""

I won't go any further, although there are more. My problem is that not only is this self-proclaimed ""scientist/psychologist"" coining new terms, he does it in a very QVC way. I am all for understanding the programming we submit ourselves to, and ways to understand the mind, and patterns of thought, however this book is a waste of time, only for the mindless reader that in fact turns off their brain to read this book (the author actually asks you to do that while reading, its in one of the first chapters, right after he tries to convince the reader that ""telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition have been established by scientific laboratory experiments."" That is the actual sentence from page 24. I would be delighted by nothing more than to get ahold of these ""scientific laboratory experiments"" data records to see this for myself. Considering this was written over 45 years ago... well, everyone draws their own conclusions but please save your time and money.",45

Joshua S. Peters,1.0 out of 5 stars,Psychocybernetics,50+ year old psuedo science trash that leans heavily on religion,"The amount of actionable, real steps in the book could be boiled down to about 20 pages. The rest is filled with case studies that have bee refuted, ideas that are no longer valid and lots, and lots of God talk. When the author runs up against the wall of lack of evidence he just simply states ""and this is where science runs out so we need to turn to religion"". Instead of posing questions about what needs to come and pondering on the advancements that will be achieved by science he just simply states ""God made you this way now be happy with it."" You wouldn't consult a 2,000 year old medical journal for proper surgical procedures, so why would you try to apply the workings of 2,000 year old brains who thought the earth was flat and rain could be obtained with animal sacrifices and dances to modern brains?

Bryan R. Osborne,5.0 out of 5 stars,Operations Research: An Introduction,Very Useful Book,"I do not use Operations Research (OR) often; this is the reason why when I do, it is important that the book I use is clear, detailed in its explanations and provides numerous examples. This allows me to ""relearn"" the methods and correct applications of the methods for my work. I am a project manager and engineer for municipal type work, I primarily use OR for preliminary assessments and feasibility studies to provide other managers and elected officials with the most likely successful or optimal solution and justification of my recommendations.

This book is fairly good in explaining the applicability of the methods and the proper procedures in detail. OR should be used more often by managers, most of the managers I have worked with do not use any form of statistical, probabilistic or numerical methods to determine optimal solutions.

Giboney military-specops fiction (maybe) book; it was an exciting read. I really hated to put it down, and only did when I had to. I enjoyed the story and action, with realistic and believable high-tech and SpecOps, start to finish. I found myself continually ""analyzing"" the physics of the ""EMP"" aspects (weapons, towers, and dead zones) in the near future setting, with no obvious flaws. He had an interesting mix of active duty & retired military, U.S. Military Academy, and Special Operations/Special Forces players. I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend CyberWar Vengeance to anyone who enjoys ""Tom Clancy"" type near future military/specops fiction.",4
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,CyberWar Vengeance,Timely topic and first rate page turner,"The special operations training and missions have a ""been there done that"" feel. The science seems plausible and the politics and issues raised couldn't be more timely. The writer knows how to keep things moving briskly along while keeping the reader involved.

Not exactly a cliffhanger ending but it definitely sets up a Book Two. Looking forward to that, hopes it gets here soon.",7
Dave L,5.0 out of 5 stars,CyberWar Vengeance,Outstanding read!,"If you like Vince Flynn, Brad Thor, Robert Ludlum, John Grisham or any of that ilk, you will LOVE this book!

What makes it fascinating is the absolute believability of the scenario. Totally plausible in today's environment just a shade into the future.

I never felt overwhelmed because there was so little specific and nothing even slightly negative. It described Windows 10 about as well as the Chamber of Commerce covers New York City. You know; it has lots of tall buildings, and culture, and its really great! I was only able to get some good from it by sitting down at the computer and wrestling with the actual operating system as I tried to decipher the meaning of the text I was reading.

My laptop got updated to Windows 10 and I was very happy. However, all of a sudden I had a very fancy looking screen and everything I saw seemed entirely different. I could manoeuvre through some apps but I got overwhelmed when it came to different settings. After a few days, I came across this book by Mathew Sanderson on Windows 10 and heaved a sigh of relief. The latest version of Windows is explained with pictures in a very concise and systematic manner. It’s a small book and it doesn’t bore with other techie stuff.

I am not a hacker nor am I a wannabe hacker! I wasn’t a person who used the internet or computers excessively, but recently due to my new business work I need to get more acquainted with them. And that included the cons as well. Buying this book (not exactly this but something with the same topic) was my husband’s idea so that I would get a more in-detail idea of the ‘matrix’ these days. I am glad I did purchase this book, because it made me realize about the many weaknesses within a computer and network.

The basics as well as more advance stuff are included here and also it was really easy to understand what they are about. There were links included to some of the software sites, and this was really convenient for me. I just checked some of them out to get a better idea of the software. Personally for me, I think the file search software could be quite useful (I am horrible at organization). Before I didn’t think much of viruses, Trojan horses, worms, dns and some I haven’t even heard of etc.
Of course at the end, I had trouble getting a clear idea of all those codes, zips, dns etc. This would actually help me to protect myself against hacking.",1

This information can be used to plug in the holes and find weak areas in my system. Also made me aware of possible attacks from outside and how they can be prevented. It pays to invest in anti-malware and virus programs but it is also one thing to learn the basics of these attacks to better fight them.

There is a whole chapter on crating Cornwizner, the Worgen Warrior. To bad there is no worgen race in Rift.
Another chapter talks of the best way to gather cloth for first aid. Again this is not applicable to rift.
There is very little information in this POC at all. And what is there only applies to Rift in a very generic fashion.
I took one for the team buying this.
This is bad enough that I think this company should be banned from Amazon!",15
