Justin Chen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series),Awesome Deep Learning Textbook,"I was pretty excited when I heard earlier this year that Yoshua Bengio, Ian Goodfellow, and Aaron Courville were writing this textbook. Just got my copy in the mail today. Read a few chapters and skimmed through some of the book. This is a very comprehensive, well-written, and easy-to-understand textbook on the theoretical foundations, current research, and applications of deep learning. I've read a lot of research papers (DeepMind, Google Brain, Facebook, NYU, Stanford, etc.), blogs (Nervana Systems, Indico, Colah, Otoro's Blog, etc.), lecture notes (Stanford cs231n, cs224d, cs229), and tutorials (Quoc Le's tutorial, TensorFlow, etc.), and have watched a lot of videos (Hugo Larochelle's tutorials, Stanford cs229, TedTalks, lectures by Yann LeCun <3, etc.) to teach myself this topic. Despite the abundance of great resources floating around on the internet, there hasn't been any single thoroughly compiled resource like this. I'm wicked excited to finally own a copy. Many thanks. Shouts from Boston University! :D",67
Jeffrey Heaton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series),"Very good book, likely to be heavily cited in future ...","This will very likely become ""the textbook"" of choice for graduate level neural network classes looking for a broad mathematical foundation for deep learning. This is very important, as there have been a number of important technologies introduced that make classical neural networks into what we think of today as ""deep learning"". The book is divided into 3 highly effective thirds. The first third provides a mathematical background and can be skipped by those who already understand linear algebra, probability and calculus at a high enough level for the book. The 2nd third introduces what we think of in 2016 (and beyond) as deep learning. The final third introduces the most current research that might likely become part of the mainstream of deep learning. Those looking to implement current deep learning (and not research) can safely skip the last third. Skipping the middle would not make sense. Very good book, likely to be heavily cited in future academic work.",20
MA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series),Accessible yet thorough,"This is a very nice book. It is structured into chapters with an eye on different audience. The first few chapters are for people not very familiar with statistical learning. The next sections are focused on ""engineers"" and people who want to use the current state of art. The remaining part of the book goes more into depth and will be make researchers in the field happy.

I like the style of the authors, which emphasizes intuition but not at the expense of formal clarity.",3

There really isn't a better way to get into the subject - this book gives you the practical details that papers gloss over, and the theory you won't get from a Tensorflow tutorial. If you are working in machine learning and don't already have doctoral-level knowledge in this area, you can't afford NOT to buy this book. Sold out for a reason!",5

Mario Schlosser,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies","Sometimes friends over a beer philosophizing, sometimes clever analogies","I love the general idea of evaluating the potential perils of artificial super intelligence, and I buy into the concept of thinking this through at an abstract level, not tied to the current state of AI algorithms in today's computer science. That's what this book does - systematically explore every branch of a pretty large decision tree around everything that could or could not happen when an artificial intelligence starts developing super-intelligence, and how we should deal with it. So, conceptually cool. But practically, in the case of this book, not very interesting. For a couple of reasons.

First, the level of abstraction really is taken to an extreme. Forget about any relation between arguments in this book and anything we've actually been able to do in AI research today. You won't find a discussion of a single algorithm or even exploration of higher-level mathematical properties of existing algorithms in this book. As a result, this book could have been written 30 years ago, and its arguments wouldn't be any different. Fine, I guess (the author after all is a philosophy professor, not a computer scientist); but I found this lacking at times. It gets particularly boring when the author actually does spend pages over pages on introducing a framework on how our AI algorithms could improve (through speed improvement, or quality improvement, etc.) - but still doesn't tie it to anything concrete. If you want to take the abstraction high road, just dispense with super generalized frameworks like this altogether and get to the point. Similar to the discussion of where the recalcitrance of a future AI will come from, whether from software, content or hardware: purely abstract and speculative, even though there are real-world examples of hardware evolution speed outpacing software design speed and the other way around (e.g., the troubles of electronic design automation keeping up with Moore's Law).

Second, even if you operate fully in the realm of speculation, at least make that speculation tangible and interesting. A list of things an AI could be good at lists stuff like ""social persuasion"" (= convince governments to do something, and hack the internet). Struck me a lot of times as the kind of ideas you'd come up with if you thought about a particular scenario for a few minutes over a beer with friends. Very few counterintuitive ideas in there. One chapter grandly announces the presentation of an elaborate ""takeover scenario"", i.e., how would a superintelligence actually take over the world - and again it remains completely abstract and not original or practical. (""AI becomes smart, starts improving itself, takes over the world"" - couldn't have guessed it myself.)

Third, a lot of the inferences in the book struck me as nothing more than one-step inferences, making it a relatively shallow brainstorming-type book. (""This could happen, and also this other thing could happen, and this third thing as well."") Systematic exploration of a large decision tree gets interesting when you start combining lots of different scenarios in counter-intuitive ways. Again the ""friends over a beer"" problem. At times the philosophizing in some chapters reads like a mildly interesting Star Trek episode (such as the one about how to best set goals for an AI so that it acts morally and doesn't kill us). In the best and worst ways.

But every now and then, there's a clever historical analogy, and an interesting idea. Ronald Reagan wasn't willing to share the technology on how to efficiently milk cows, but he offered to share SDI with the USSR - how would AI be shared? Or, the insight that the difference between the dumbest and smartest human alive is tiny on a total intelligence scale (from IQ 75 to IQ 180) - and that this means that an AI would likely look to humans as if it very suddenly leapt from being really dumb to unbelievably smart and bridge this tiny human intelligence gap extremely quickly. But what struck me with regards to the best ideas in the book is that the book almost always quotes just one guy, Eliezer Yudkovsky... which made me think that if I wanted to read a thought-provoking, counter-intuitive book on AI super intelligence (as opposed to a treatise that appears to at times gloss over the shallowness of its ideas by making up with long text), I should just go and read Yudkovsky.

All in all though, the topic itself is so interesting that it's worth giving the book a try.",45
Brandon B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",Important discussion but boring,"Ostensibly this is meant as an accessible introduction to the philosophical ramifications and possible existential threats that a superintelligent artificial intelligence would pose. Although it's an intellectual rigorous and honest work, it is extremely dull and lifeless most of the time. The author does a great job at fleshing out the logically plausible consequences of a superintelligent AI and even bringing in a summary of the state of the field, this work reads as fairly academic and quite the opposite of a page turner. The author is clearly great at his day job of philosophy but is not a great writer of what we might call ""popular philosophy."" I thought the discussion was interesting and provocative but unfortunately it was taxing to read. I believe every good book needs to be written as a story, and this was certainly not a story, it was chapter after chapter of logical deductions, thought experiments and blah blah..

Substance: 5/5
Readability: 2/5
Overall: 3.5/5 (I rounded up)",6
CFortC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies","Important, original contribution","This book addresses its title subject in a very thorough, no holds barred, albeit somewhat academic manner. Bostrom chases down any loose ends with a vengeance. The AIs, when they come, will certainly find this one interesting, or at least amusing.

While reading it, I was struck that Bostrom was offering up page after page of valuable starting points for science fiction stories. Similar stories have already been written by authors such as Greg Egan and William Gibson. At some point, I realized the entire book could be framed and read as a kind of science fiction novel in itself.

I have a computer science, IT, and sci-fi reading background, and overall I think the book is an important, original contribution to a topic which, though far removed from the daily news feed of wars, disasters, and climate change, may someday come to equal or exceed those in impact. I have down-rated by one star because as the book moved on the prose became a bit of a slog for me. Cheers for the 64 pages of end notes and bibliography.",4
James D. Pollard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",A needed counterweight to Kurzweil,"A book on the singularity NOT written by Kurzweil, which (nothing necessarily against Kurzweil) is a good thing. And, actually, author Bostrom is at pains to distance himself from the very term 'singularity', it having become a buzzword bandied about with no exact definition.

Exactness is very much Bostrom's focus. He attacks the topic with the philosopher's insistence on explicit definitions and careful thinking, proceeding from the admission that we don't know how these things can develop, but there are a few things we do know. Once an artificial intelligence system reaches a certain threshold, it's next project will be to make itself more intelligent (or engineer a smarter version of itself.) There's no known limit to that process, and since it will take place at computer speeds, things could very rapidly get out of control.

Well, you tell yourself. We could always pull the plug. But what if it's a distributed system? Pulling one plug won't do it. What if it makes copies of itself and sends them off to run elsewhere? What if it pretends to be benign, but uses social engineering to dupe accomplices into helping it?

There are a large number of ways this can turn into, in Bostrom's words, an ""existential catastrophe"". Ways we can't even conceive. Remember, this thing will be SUPER intelligent. We are not ready.

Bostrom works through the implications. How do we program the system's goals? How do we configure its value system? What sorts of safeguards have any chance? Can we confine it in some way until we know it's benign? How CAN we know if it's benign? What happens when one development project has such a lead that the resulting system is very much more powerful than any competitor? What happens when there are multiple such systems? Do we let them communicate? Do we let them merge? They're superintelligent, will we be able to stop them?

We lurch closer and closer to the takeoff threshold, without knowing how close we are, and without preparation for what will follow. This book is a good place to start, and should be read as widely as possible.",1
Skubalon12,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",Likely the Best Philosophical Discussion of AI,"This book is heavily philosophical. While the hardcover is only 260 pages, it is very dense and can become a slow read if you are trying to fully understand each of the steps that the author takes you through to understand all of what the development of ""superintelligence"" will really entails. I am a layperson in both philosophy as well as computer science. The book took me about a week to read, but I had to skip over some parts (mostly near the end) where there was a vast departure from what I expected the book to be about. This isn't a criticism of course; it's just a good opportunity to try explaining what you get when sitting down to read this incredible work.

With this book, the author seeks to discuss just what the subtitle says: paths, dangers and strategies of humans creating a object that is superintelligent. It is not a technical discussion of what is currently happening in this area (for example, there are few mentions of current efforts like IBM's ""Watson"" or the robots being built by Boston Dynamics). This is a book whose purpose is to walk through (in a very abstract sense) the types, paths, dangers and scenarios related to mankind developing a superintelligence (one with a human-like general intelligence taken to an incredible, unimaginable degree). It is technical only in points such as the ethics of choosing how to program values into a superintelligence system. This isn't sci-fi, so please don't pick this one up thinking its a good companion to your Matrix trilogy collection.

Still, I think that this book is exceptional for its philosophical treatment of this issue. It's incredibly thorough and probably encompasses all the issues and concerns that mankind should wrestle with before lunging headfirst toward its first truly human-like AI. The issue of course is that in philosophizing about how the AI expansion may end up, all of this could happen or none of it could. As soon as you read the parts where the author talks about the development of an intelligence that exceeds our own, you realize the disadvantage we have in even guessing how things might evolve and what we could do to control it. Hopefully a lot of the right people read this (soon enough) so that these dangers are hopefully averted. This book is for the Elon Musks of this world, people with the capacity to both make real progress toward AI and understand the issues involved. For the rest of us, this is a lot of high philosophy that deserves attention but will probably be ignored for its low entertainment value.",1
Neal Freeland,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",The Terminator is optimistic scenario,"This book makes The Terminator seem like an optimistic scenario. In the movie humans at least hope to win against intelligent machines they created. Bostrom worries we are doomed.

We are used to machines being faster and more powerful than us (cars, forklifts). They are becoming smarter, too (search, product recommendations). When engines replaced horses, 95% of horses disappeared. What will happen when machines become smarter than humans? Bostrom wrote this book in 2014 and postulated that machines could defeat humans at Go in 10-15 years. It happened last year. Uh-oh.

To be fair, this book is about strategies to approach the problem of control to harness superintelligence towards beneficial human goals. He just shows how hard that is to define, and how dangerous unintended consequences could result. How do we tell a machine to create ""the good life"" and write code to make it happen?

As a practitioner working daily in my job at Microsoft to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to customer and business problems (search, risk, customer knowledge...), I find it quite a stretch to go from what I'll do this week to the massive runaway intelligence explosion represented by ""the singularity."" But I do like a good thought experiment. I'll be pondering this one for a while.",1
M. Waits,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies","Fear the AI, respect the AI, control the AI","Nick Bostrom delivers a hard hitting reality of stupid we are to pursue AI with caution to the wind. AI is extremely dangerous and his suggestion on attempting to control it before the cat gets out of the bag is crucial. Reading these last few sentences one would think I am crazy, well just power through a couple of chapters of Bostrom's book and you will come around. Also, I really liked how there was no filler in this book, straight hard hitting content with huge vocabulary words. I read it since Elon Musk suggested it and he was spot on.",4
XY,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",may stimulate thought,"I'm glad this book was written, not because I approve of the content, but because I hope it succeeds in drawing thoughtful attention to the topic. Complaints:
(1) Several fine books on animal intelligence (both human and non-human) have been written by researchers NOT connected in any way to the AI community. If the author had digested these books before writing this one, its content may have been very different. For example, had the author admitted that the concept of intelligence is currently poorly defined, he would have been forced to also admit that the concept of superintelligence is also currently poorly defined.
(2) I would have preferred that the book be more firmly anchored in the here-and-now. We humans already cede control over various aspects of our lives to machines (for example, cruise control in cars and auto-pilot in airplanes). A careful analysis of the various ways that we willingly cede control today may provide a useful intellectual framework for identifying and analyzing the types of control that we may cede in the future (either accidentally or intentionally).",2
Ravi Morey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",An Outstanding Analysis of the Problem of a Potentially Evil Superintelligence,"Nick Bostrom has achieved a tour de force with the publication of this book. He clearly has in-depth knowledge of philosophy, physics and computer science; a rare combination indeed. His analysis of the pros and cons of various approaches to solving the problem of the potential emergence of an evil superintelligence is exquisite in its subtlety. I have only one objection to his proposals. I believe the only only realistic way of instituting the necessary precautions is through an expert body of IT professionals and philosophers such as Nick Bostrom. Any wider participation would lead to suboptimal outcomes, possibly even gridlock. This potentially existential threat to humanity must be prevented from becoming a reality and only an expert body can give the assurance necessary.",2
Hugh Perkins,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies","Awesome book. Arguably essential reading for science fiction writers, and for futurists.","This book is awesome. I've been looking for something like this book for about 15 years, ever since I realized something like the Singularity might happen, and then realized that Vernor Vinge had beaten me to the idea by about 16 years. Turns out actually that people realized this already back in the 50s, as pointed out in this book.

This book is arguably essential reading for both science fiction writers and futurists, ie for people writing about what could happen in the future:

- For science-fiction writers, there is a rich wealth of possible future scenarios here. I mean, every page has enough scenarios, just in one page, to write around 5 to 10 different books, meaning 5 to 10 concepts, on many of the pages. Amazingly content rich

- For futurists, this book is well worth it just for the presence of so many resources and references in one place. You want to assert that super-intelligence is at least plausibly possible? Present the survey of leading experts, and present the 10%, 50%, and 90% estimates, averaged across the experts. No longer do you need to just says ""I think that..."", and ""Hey, look at this graph of MIPS per Intel die"", so believe what I say. I mean, one can still say this, but there is a very rich set of data, resources, references, here. And it's written in a very professional, scientific, academic style, without any particularly overly obvious sensationalism. Understatement if anything. But really, neither sensationalism nor understatement, just statement of different possibilities, their probabilities, and all from a relatively detached viewpoint.

I was initially surprised that this is written by a professor of philosophy, rather than a professor of machine learning, or computer science, but on reflection it makes perfect sense. The professors of machine learning and computer science are busy working on the next small incremental improvement in combining several models together in some novel way, or improving deep neural net learning, and so on. They have neither the funding, nor the time, to take a step back, and look at the bigger picture, as Nick Bostrom has done here.

I'm not going to say this book is perfect, but it's pretty close to it :-)",9

I know that many will say, ""That can never happen! It's just 'Science Fiction'. We're talking about machines that will never think for themselves"".

It covers a lot of theory, has a lot of charts that can't be read on a kindle, and sums it up by saying, in effect, ""who knows?"" This subtitle of this book is all covered: The Paths, Dangers, and Strategies of attempting to handle AI Superintelligence is presented in a very repetitive format that jumbles things up a lot and says we will discuss this more in whatever chapter gets back to it. The previous sentence is a toned down attempt to demonstrate the author's writing style. The daisy chain could be 3 or four links later.

If, at the end of a very long read, the author can reach no conclusions, and not very much new was revealed, where IS the Superintelligence? I am convinced the author is a very smart and is knowledgeable about the subject; and probably a wonderful guy. But unless you can commit to providing details on how to bake the bread, there is not much worthwhile in providing a long list of ingredients and detailing endlessly what each ingredient may do. We will discuss each ingredient in further chapters. I would recommend ""Our Final Invention"" for a more informative look at the very near future.",3
Mullet Man,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies","Great ideas and discussion, annonying writing style.","Great book! It raises several questions about the implications of super intelligent AI. The book also walks through multiple scenarios of how machine superintelligence could play out. This book will definitely get you thinking about the subject of machine AI and how it will effect the human race.

The writing style could be described as verbose. Meaning that it is often unnecessarily wordy and is some cases repetitive. The writing style is a bit hard to follow in some parts. Due to the unnecessary vocabulary and verbose writing I read this book at a slower pace than most books. Despite the shortcomings in writing style the information in the book is very exciting. If you are interested in AI and machine intelligence read this book for sure. I'd recommend starting with an easier to understand book first such as How to Create a Mind by Ray Kurzweil.",3

Patrick L. Boyle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",Heaven or Hell?,"This book is simply brilliant. Bostrom is scary smart. It is a magnificent read in every way except one. That one deficiency may not matter to you so for many of you this is a true five star book.

The subject of this book is arguably the most important one in the history of the plant and the species. It is conceivable that we are approaching a logical continuation of biological evolution which results in one of two fundamental changes to the human race. It seems mostly likely that an inhuman machine intelligence will arise in the near future that will have to decide what to do with all human beings. Having read Bostrom's arguments it seems likely to me that this takeover will happen fast and there will be only one victor to emerge. It doesn't look like humans will be able to oppose the coming intelligence in any effective way. But it is not clear what the new god like intelligence will choose to do.

It could simply exterminate mankind. As we look out at the stars and imagine that we are seeing countless alien civilizations or former civilizations we may be witnessing the graveyards of other biological beings. It may be that biological life starts spontaneously on planets everywhere and at some point the biological beings develop machines that have fewer limitations. If the machines choose to simply eliminate their biological creators then that's what will happen. This scenario may have played out thousands of times in nearby galaxies. So in a sense it could be considered natural.

Species extinction is the most common plot line in Science Fiction when superintelligent machines are considered. But there is another possibility. People as presently constituted are pretty much confined to the surface of the Earth, Mars and possibly a few large moons. It might be also possible to create large structures in orbit that can house a self sustaining civilization. Presuming that biological humans will never travel to the stars that means that we are now near our ultimate expansion possibilities. It's had to imagine how people will ever walk on the surface of the gas giants if only because they don't have surfaces. But machines can be constructed that can use the entire solar system. Maybe Jupiter could be inhabited by some kind of high pressure creature who swam.

The point is that humans as presently constituted have nearly exhausted all their possibilities here in this solar system. Furthermore humans will continue to be short lived frail creatures subject to accidents and disease. If we cure cancer and live a hundred years that's good but it's not all that much. But if we download a human's personality into a virtual space that exists in some cyber universe, the people will be virtually immortal and had infinite space to explore.

An intelligent machine that were to take over could presumably incorporate the personalities of everyone on earth without too much trouble. The superintelligent singleton that some of us at least will soon meet, may wipe us out or present us with eternal life without sickness and perfect happiness. So heaven or hell?

Bostrom walks us through several possibilities but doesn't make specific predictions. He doesn't say to either but the logic of his argument is that Superintelligence is coming and it's coming fast. It may happen in just a few hours. Indeed it may have already taken place and the singleton is choosing not to reveal itself just yet. I certainly don't know but it's obvious that machine smarts are accelerating. There is a new robot or a new app that surprises us nearly every week. We are getting close.

<B>The Deficiency.</B>
I'm 72. I read a lot now that I'm retired. I read approximately two books a week. With my glasses my eyes are just fine - or so I thought. But this book is so packed with information that in order to keep total book length to just a little over 300 page they have had to print nearly twice as must text per page. I'm finding it hard to enjoy reading such small text.

I'll comment on the intellectual content of the book later but let me dwell for a moment on the print size.

I'm currently reading three books simultaneously. I'm about a third of the way into this book 'Superintelligence'. I'm also about a third of the way through ' Catching Fire' by Richard Wrangerham, and I'm just a few pages into ' Sharp's Revenge' by Bernhard Cornwell. The Sharp novel is fiction the other two are non-fiction. The novel is 348 pages long. The anthropology-diet book is 307 pages and this book is 328. But the amount of text per page varies quite a bit. There are about 36 lines per page in the novel and each line is about ten words. So we have 348 pages of text with about 360 words per page yielding about 125,000 words. In ' Catching Fire' there are only about 28 lines of ten words each. At 307 pages this means only about 86,000 words. This book - 'Superintelligence' - has pages with 45 lines each of which is about 14 words each. That means this book has approximately 200,000 words. It is nearly twice as long as the Sharp novel and close to three times the length of ' Catching Fire'.

So all other things being equal, this book gives you the best bargain. But it ends up being rather harder for my old eyes to read. The Sharpe novel is hard on the eyes in another way. It's printed on yellowish paper in an infelicitous type face. This book is printed on good paper in a good font but it's just too small. This much text should have been spread across at least another hundred pages in my opinion.

As to content, there not much more anyone could ask on this topic. Bostrom is impressively erudite. He seems to be familiar with all of the relevant literature. I was deeply involved in an effort to bring Artificial Intelligence to public welfare eligibility processing about twenty or thirty years ago. This was with a ' Expert System' . I had nearly forgotten Expert Systems, it was so long ago and such a disappointment. But Bostrom covers this obscure branch of AI along with all the other better known branches.

Bostrom's coverage is encyclopedic.",2

We try to ensure that by the time they have the power to cause real harm we've instilled a sense of ethics and compassion in them. Instead, one of the author's solutions to the ""control problem"" is to lock a superintelligent AI in a box with a kill switch, and not let it communicate to the outside world except for answering questions posed to it with ""yes/no"" (so that it could not influence the humans into letting it out, of course).

Extremely impressive in its breadth of knowledge and fastidiousness of its argument -- and yet totally unconvincing in its general message.
It seems to me that the estimates of possible dates for AI reaching human intelligence by AI experts are mostly far too near and Bostrom, because he has too much personally invested in transhumanist nonsense and this idea of technological transcendence, isn't clear-eyed enough to see this. If this massive advance happens at all, I think the upper bound of AI-expert estimates is the time frame we should expect it in.
He acknowledges his uncertainty constantly (Bostrom aspires to be a robot himself, constantly striving to avoid the bias that comes with overconfidence, which partly explains why the book is so weird), but I almost think that the book was pointless because of how uncertain this future is. The book is a remarkable effort though, which is why I have given it four stars.

Nick Bostrom's book looks at this coming crisis and how best to cope with it before it gets beyond our control. Once machines surpass us in intelligence and progressively become even more intelligent, we will have lost our ability to control what happens next. Before this comes to pass, it is essential that we develop a strategy to influence what happens so that the potential dangers are dealt with before they develop.

James R,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies","Interesting for anyone, but a must-read for all AI researchers","The author has obviously put a huge amount of thought into this topic. The number of angles he considers in terms of implementation timelines, methodologies, pros and cons for each, likelihood of the success of different methodologies over various timeframes, are impressive.

For example, in discussing the various ways in which AI might be implemented, he concludes that AI (and subsequently, super-intelligent AI) via whole brain emulation is essentially guaranteed to happen due to ever-improving scanning techniques such as MRI or electron microscopy, ever-increasing computing power, and the fact that understanding the brain is not necessary to emulate the brain. Rather, once you can scan it in enough detail, and you have enough hardware to simulate it, it can be done even if the overarching design is a black box to you (individual neurons or clusters of neurons can already be simulated, but we lack the computing power to simulate 10 billion neurons, and we lack the knowledge of how they are all connected in a human brain -- something which various scanning projects are already tackling).

However, he also concludes that due to the time it will take to achieve the necessary advances in scanning and hardware, whole brain emulation is unlikely to be how advanced AI is actually, or initially, achieved. Rather, more conventional AI programming techniques, while perhaps posing a greater need for understanding the nature of intelligence, have a much-reduced hardware requirement (and no scanning requirement) and are likely to reach fruition first.

This is just one example. He slices and dices these issues more ways than you can imagine, coming to what is, in the end, a fairly simple conclusion (if I may inelegantly paraphrase): Super-intelligent AI is coming. It might be in 10 years, maybe 20, maybe 50, but it is coming. And, it is potentially quite dangerous because, by definition, it is smarter than you. So, if it wants to do you harm, it will and there will be very little you can do about it. Therefore, by the time super-intelligent AI is possible, we better know not just how to make a super-intelligent AI, but a super-intelligent AI which shares human values and morals (or perhaps embodies human values and morals as we wish they were, since as he points out, we certainly would not want to use some peoples' values and morals as a template for an AI, and it may be hard to even agree on some such philosophical issues across widely-divergent cultures and beliefs).

This is a thought-provoking book. It raises issues that I never even would have thought of had the author not pointed them out. For example, ""infrastructure proliferation"" is a bizarre, yet presumably possible, way in which a super-intelligent (but in some ways, lacking common sense) AI could end life as we know it without even being malicious -- just indifferent to us while pursuing pedestrian goals in what is, to it, a perfectly logical manner.

I share the author's concerns. Human-level (much less super-intelligent) AI seems far away. So, why worry about the consequences right now? There will be plenty of time to deal with such issues as the ability to program strong AI gets closer. Right?

Maybe, maybe not. As the author also describes in detail, there are many scenarios (perhaps the most likely ones) where one day you don't have AI, and the next you do (e.g., only a single algorithm tweak was keeping the system from being intelligent and with that solved, all of the sudden your program is smarter than you -- and able to recursively improve itself so that days, or maybe hours or minutes later, it is WAY smarter than you). I hope AI researchers take heed of this book. If the ability to program goals, values, morals and common sense into a computer is not developed in parallel with the ability to create programs that dispassionately ""think"" at a very high level, we could have a very big problem on our hands.",5

Jeffrey Eldred,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",Huge disappointment and just plain overrated...,"I've been exposed to a lot of tech and philosophy people concerned with intelligence explosion, and I always felt a little skeptical. I read this book hoping to find an air-tight well-researched argument that matches the certainty that these people have that they are right. Unfortunately that's not the case.

Bostrom tries to be conservative in his argumentation, discussing about how it could happen this way or that way, but fails to do so where it counts. To just take one example, very premise of an intelligent explosion, that a intelligent computer can make any significant improvement on its software in any reasonable amount of time (let alone several orders of magnitude instantly) goes completely unjustified. It reminds me so much of hearing a priori theological arguments - the weakest premise is always the one taken to be self-evident.

I hold back on giving this one-star for two reasons. The first is that important people are starting to take this book seriously. That's no endorsement, but this is the book to read if you want to disabuse our tech elites of their new religion. The second is that it seems like not everything in this book is garbage, so it could have value if you also prepared to ignore large swaths of it - i.e. if you are the sort of person that knows bulls*** when you see it but also would never do something as pompous as proclaiming yourself a ""rationalist"".

Bostrom is over-explaining too much and therefore distracts from the narrative. Perhaps restructuring the book to first lay the foundation of artificial intelligence properly and then add the ability to zoom in on certain aspects in other chapters would have made the book easier to follow.

Update:
I think that I have realized why it was so difficult to pick the book each time to read (from my Kindle): the discussion is about artificial intelligence, which suggests an agent that appears to be alive, i.e. a being or character that we might encounter.

Bostrom did not give the various kinds of artificial agents properly defined characters to keep the narrative and concepts easily together. i.e. I struggled to create a clear picture in my head of each kind of intelligence as a being conniving to end humanity for the sake of paper-clips while negotiating its way through our safety gates and counter measures. The characters are almost there, but just too scattered throughout the chapters to form a clear picture.

A good example of where characterization was used to good effect was in The Sociopath Next Door. Stout described each of the different manifestations of sociopathy by starting with stories of fictional characters in hypothetical situations. Any discussions following that story made the more academic content easy to place into context.",8

Roto,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",I can't recommend it highly,"OK, I read it. I can't recommend it highly. Because I think the author spends too much time apparently stroking his own ego and trying to impress his audience, particular perhaps his colleagues, with his mental dexterity. The writing seems less for communicating information than to show wordy craftsmanship. The book would have made a fine 12 page paper if it communicated ideas effectively and concisely to an audience. As a physicist and having long time industry experience with computer software and hardware, including extremely large cluster supercomputers, its quite evident the author has little practical experience with computer technology. Plus the entire premise involves trying to control an omniscient and omnipotent entity we create to avoid an explosive takeover by such a thing because of its vastly superior and exponentially rising intelligence over humans. By definition, there is no way to ensure control of an omnipotent being. It could get around anything you devised even if you used it to devise your method (it could get around that). Initial conditions do not ensure final conditions. There are too many unknowables. The book labors on that and for what? Unknowables are not useful to worry about again by definition. All that said, it is an important subject and this book is probably the most complete to date. I think AI will have dramatic effects on jobs, including most especially white collar jobs, wherein large numbers of people will not be required to produce ever more. Wealth distribution is likely to become a serious concern (as if its not now). At the end, the book does have a positive outlook and a beneficial to man hope. That is very good.

fred,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",Two opposing AI futures: the intelligence explosion dooomsday versus the rapture of the nerds,"I just finished reading two ""cautionary tale"" AI books:

Our Final Invention: AI and the end of the human era
by James Barrat

Superintelligence: paths, dangers, strategies
by Nick Bostrom

These two authors hold a very pessimistic view of what AI research might lead to, which is the antithesis of the optimistic view held by Ray Kurzweil.

Both Barrat and Bostrom believe that unguided and unregulated Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research poses an existential risk to humanity.

Neither, however, believes that a relinquishment strategy - some kind of global ban on further AGI research - will work.

More specifically, what they fear is that a self-referential, self-improving Seed-AI will result in an intelligence explosion. The sequence goes something like this:

a) SeedAI gets started and starts learning to improve and expand its own reasoning and learning abilities.

b) SeedAI develops a general, flexible intelligence (it becomes an AGI).

c) AGI develops into a Human Level Machine Intelligence (HLMI).

d) HLMI reads through the library of all books.

e) The self improving HMLI becomes an Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), one which is vastly more intelligent than any one human or all of humanity put together. Further, even though it is superintelligent, it is totally alien to us. We cannot understand and predict its behavior with our ""folk psychology"" the way we predict how other humans might behave. And, it does not share our values nor does it value us.

f) Although we try to contain the ASI and give it ""friendlyAI"" values, we find out too late that we cannot control it and a humankind -vs- ASI conflict develops.

g) We lose and the ASI moves on to take over the universe. In the process, it may or may not encounter and do battle with other ASI's that have developed on other planets.

Neither author holds out much hope. Bostrom advocates a development path that tries to maintain a relinquishment strategy on AGI research while at the same time work on ""friendly-AI"" continues.

Bostrom seems to believe that ""friendly-AI"" research will be able to find a way to specify the values and high level goals an ASI would need to have to live in harmony with mankind both now and on into the future.

Kurzweil, however, believes that a greater intelligence (especially a superintelligence) will always find a way to circumvent control measures developed by those with lesser intelligence.

Kurzweil does not believe that it has to come down to a humanity -vs- ASI conflict. He believes that the path forward is to enhance the intelligence of humanity, which means that our brains will eventually merge with machine intelligence. This is a mankind-machine co-evolution scenario, an Internet-of-Exocortexes scenario that I have discussed earlier, a scenario that is sometimes jokingly called the rapture of the nerds.

By the way, there are some authors - e.g. Bill Joy - that defend the relinquishment strategy. A number of years ago, Bill wrote a Wired article on this called: The Future Doesn't Need Us. Like Barrat and Bostrom, Bill Joy is an avoider, and as such he's a pretty gloomy fellow.

Approachers always seem to be happier than avoiders. This is especially true if the avoiders have come to believe that they cannot avoid whatever it is that they fear. Approachers are happy as long as they can make incremental progress toward whatever it is that they want.

His analysis of possible outcomes is thorough and thought provoking. His consideration of the importance of transcendence intervals is a fresh idea and it alone makes the book a worthwhile read.

Since Bostrom is a philosopher it's puzzling to me that he didn't take a more philosophic approach. He seems to assume, as Asimov did, that the builders of robots will be able to impart goals and values into their creations. The work of Ron Arkin at Georgia Tech shows how easily it is for robots to generate their own values. Perhaps Bostrom's next book will consider this implication.",2

Stephen E. Robbins,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",Super Unmotivated,"For all its detail on various issues and lengthy thought-explorations on possible scenarios re the future with super intelligent AIs, this work is a heavy structure floating upon a puff of air. For a reader with some knowledge of the many subjects the book is implicitly dealing with but failing to engage, there is a crucial failure to motivate its extensive considerations - this makes it very hard to read with any interest past a certain point.

Bostrom initially lays out the many accomplishments of AI. There is the games dimension - chess, checkers, jeopardy and many more - for which an AI is now the champion player - though in all these, he notes, the achievement is via very specific algorithms good only for that game, i.e., with little application to a general intelligence. He notes AI's main paths or approaches to intelligence, their strengths, weaknesses and tradeoffs: 1) The neural network/connectionist approach, 2) the evolutionary algorithms, 3) and the symbolic manipulation approach (GOFAI) which chronologically preceded, and yielded things like theorem provers, problem solving programs like GPS, ""conversation"" programs like ELIZA, expert systems, etc. He leaves implicit that these three paths lead to a giant black hole from which no exit is seen, for as he notes, standing in the distance on the other side are two huge, untaken hills: common sense knowledge and true language comprehension. These, he notes, are utterly essential to human equivalent intelligence, but AI has no current strategy to take these hills as Bostrom again leaves implicit, nor is there any current indication the three main paths will yield one, in fact there is the opposite indication. Elsewhere, Hofstadter (Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire of Thinking), in his extensive tome showing that analogy is foundational to thought and language, and while eviscerating current AI language achievements, is obviously doubtful that computers (as currently conceived) can deal with this (analogy, thus language) at all.

But after taking us to the edge of this black hole, Bostrom turns 90 degrees, ignoring the two hills, and now discusses very general methods by which AI will achieve human equivalence. In this, it is safe to say, his hopes primarily fall on whole brain emulation (WBE). But his description of this approach, while seemingly detailed, fails utterly to describe its true difficulties; WBE is an untaken Everest. I suggest the recent, The Future of the Brain: Essays by the World's Leading Neuroscientists and perhaps view my (5 star) review thereof. The authors, Marcus and Freeman, are neuroscience guys discussing the massive difficulties which the huge projects embarking on brain mapping actually face, for example: We face a 85 billion neuron brain with roughly 1000 types of neurons, the functions of none of which we understand. We do not know basic facts such as how memory (our experience) is stored. We are quite certain that the brain is NOT using what we understand currently as ""computation,"" but we do not know what this other form is (Marcus ridicules current connectionism). We face data from neural recordings that will be so massive, it will be in zeta-bytes, yet any interpretation will be completely dependent on a guiding theory - note, a theory - when we have none such. It will be, they say, like trying to learn what a laptop is and does by taking electrical recordings, when we have no theory of, or knowledge of, the existence of something called ""software.""

This is to say, we really have no clue what type of ""device"" the brain actually is. This is exacerbated by the fact that the reason we have no understanding of how experience is stored in the brain (or if), is that we have no theory of what experience is, i.e., we cannot explain the origin of the image of the external world - the coffee cup, in front of us, on the table. This problem of the origin of the image is the more precise statement of Chalmers' famous ""hard problem"" of consciousness - a word (consciousness), so far as I can discern, never seen once in Bostrom's book. The whole book proceeds as though this is an unimportant problem. Yet this very subject forms part of that missing notion of ""software."" Just to give a quick idea of how important this could be in terms of the ""device"" the brain actually is and for the origin of the image of the external world, Bergson (Matter and Memory, 1896), presciently anticipating the essence of holography in 1896, viewed the brain as creating a reconstructive wave passing through the external, universal holographic field, where this ""wave"" is now specific to, or specifying, a portion of the vast information in the field, now by this process, an image - the coffee cup on the table. This requires achieving a very concrete dynamics, it would make the brain a very different form of ""device"" and perception, memory and cognition employing a far different form of ""computation,"" and it begs the question of whether such a device - being simultaneously a very concrete wave - can be embodied in silicon, wire and transistors (or even ""memristors"") at all, but rather, to support such a reconstructive wave, all this biological stuff comprising the brain, with its quantum dynamics rampant, is absolutely required. In other words, it is not a question of speculating, as Bostrom does further on, whether we will achieve human equivalence in 2075, or 2100 or 3100, it is a question of what the ultimate ""device"" we ultimately create (brain/body - AI version) will look like, an answer that will completely determine whether controlling such a device, or imparting values, or significantly increasing its intelligence, is going to be any problem or reality at all. But this can only be glimpsed by engaging with and gaining answers - unto a comprehensive theory - within a number of subjects: perception, ecological psychology, memory, explicit memory (conscious knowing an event is in one's past), cognitive development, the origin and nature of consciousness, the role of consciousness in cognition, and more - but all here ignored completely.

But the book sails serenely on from this subject of brain emulation, confident without a qualm that we will have created the brain as a silicon and wires device - it seems, confusedly, a neural net-like device that still (somehow) uses software - and now beginning long considerations on approaches by which, since it is certain that we will have electronics, we can speed up the transmission velocities, etc., say by 10,000x (and as well, modify what may well be its non-existent ""software"") thus allowing the device to quickly develop, creating and moving to a super intelligence and thus inducing the ensuing problems the rest of the book deals with. At this juncture, though I read the rest (a couple hundred pages), I lost interest; the book has utterly failed to motivate the reality, the nature, or the essence - near or far future - of anything it is discussing from this point.

Consider, finally, in this ""un-motivated"" context, the ""values-loading problem,"" coined as a term I believe by Bostrom and treated at some length, wherein we must load human values into our super intelligence to prevent it from destroying the human race. How would the super AI know NOT to get my mother out of a burning building by simply throwing her out of the tenth floor? More simply how would the super intelligence know not to stir the coffee with a Toyota or a chair? In reality, this is simply a version of the ""frame problem,"" a problem discussed heavily by AI for 30 years, then ""faded."" It sits on top of one of those hills, for it is actually the old problem of commonsense knowledge. How does the robot, stirring his cup of coffee, recognize that giant bubbles and geysers arising from the liquid, or that a feeling like stirring molasses, are anomalous - features not ""expected"" in this event? In the ""frame"" formulation, the robot has to check (constantly, with great computational expense) his list of frame axioms, axioms which specify what should be unchanged in the world as he stirs. In reality, we recognize such an anomaly because it violates one of many invariance laws structuring the event: a radial flow field defining the coffee's swirl, an adiabatic invariance (a ratio of energy of oscillation to frequency of oscillation) carried over the periodic motion of the spoon and carried over haptic flows in the hand-arm, an inertial tensor defining the angular resistance as we wield the spoon, and much more. None of this - the concrete structure, forces and dynamics of this experience - can be handled by current AI, nor are the findings of the relevant science - ecological psychology - even considered. It is on the basis of this knowledge that we recognize the ""value"" of a spoon, or of the flat of a knife, or even of an orange peel, to create the forces required for stirring coffee. This structured experience with its laws is the basis for even higher order, yes, analogy-based value statements, ""Its not nice to stir up people."" But it is worse, for values impartation, while based in this very concrete knowledge and its invariance laws, is actually embedded over our cognitive development, in our interaction with the concrete world and its beings, and this development, it is now being understood, is itself a dynamic trajectory through which our brain is travelling as a self-organizing dynamic system.

This trajectory, in Piaget's model, unfolds over two years, enabling the child to achieve the basic concepts of causality, object, space and time, the capability of explicit memory (conscious localization of past events in time), and even the ability to symbolize - yes, even the ability to symbolize - the events of the world. It requires to the age of seven to achieve concrete operations which include further grasp of space, time and number, and to the age of 12 for formal operations which include forms of logic and thought we take for granted. In other words, the brain is not only an organized structure, but a structure changing its organization along a complex trajectory purposed to achieve these conceptual and logical capabilities. Not only then must we understand the structure of these billions of neurons and their 1000 types, but also the dynamic principles embedded deep within (via DNA?) by which the structure organizes towards the ""intelligence"" we are familiar with. It again goes without saying that we have no clue whether the actual biological organization of the brain, and the natural course of its interaction with the concrete world at our normal scale of time (also specified by this dynamics) and the reorganizations involved, can be achieved in any other way than by the concrete method nature designed. (Spare me the minor evolutionary mistakes nature has supposedly made.) Further, for all the ""operations"" above, it can be shown that consciousness is required. None of these subject areas make it anywhere into Bostrom. We are asked to worry about values-imparting and the supposed dangers of a silicon-based super intelligence entirely predicated upon an ignoring of all these issues and more, all of which beg or even scream questions not only on what intelligence actually is, but whether any of these proposed concerns have the slightest reality. It is just a bit difficult for me then to attend to a large structure of concerns which float in reality upon a puff of very inadequate analysis.",15

I place some of the fault on myself for not being a philosophy student, but the book states early on that it is accessible for a lay person. I found this difficult to reconcile.

This book needed an editor who could understand the difference between useful insight and mindless spouting off of sentences. There are thousands of paragraphs that read like this:

A super intelligence might have a deep and rich personality, possessing more humor, more love, and more loyalty than any human, or it might have none of these. If it had these rich personalities then they might not even be recognizable to humans. If they were recognizable, humans may appreciate them. If they are not easily recognized, humans may not appreciate them. It it turns out that they do not have any of these qualities, it may still however appear to humans that they do have them, because of their complexity. But complexity does not necessarily equate to richness. An emotion could be complex, but not deep, or rich. Or, an emotion could be rich, but not complex. In any case, it is not know whether they will indeed have personalities, or simply seem to have them. Nor is it certain how humans may react to their possessing, or lack of, credible emotions.

This type of completely useless information is 80% of the book. It has very little in the realm of real insight, but rather lists every possible possibility direction that could be taken, but then goes nowhere. In fact most of the book could have been written thousands of years ago because all it amounts to is a collection of ""if this then that, or the other. But if not this, then maybe not that or maybe not the other"".

I finished the whole thing just because I love the topic, but I cannot recommend it to anyone. The whole book should have been edited down to 10% of it's size.

Looking For Good Science Fiction,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",I had high expectations for this book and am very disappointed with my experience in trying to get through it,"I tried to finish this book but couldn't. I got about half way through before I threw in the towel. Maybe the topic is just over my head in complexity, but I thought this book was going to be about approaches to building superintelligent machines and the benefit these machines would be to humanity. Instead the author spends an inordinate amount of space on the sociology of what would happen to humans if a superintelligent machine were invented. The text in the paragraphs are very difficult to follow so much so that I found myself thinking more than once ""What the heck is the author's point"". I had high expectations for this book and am very disappointed with my experience in trying to get through it. It is very intelligent (super or otherwise) not to waste your money on this book.",15
Dr. Q,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies",he should not be allowed to talk about disciplines where these sublime activities are intrinsic - like AI. This review is not a,"The author did not write professional software, did not devise algorithms. Thus, he should not be allowed to talk about disciplines where these sublime activities are intrinsic - like AI. This review is not a criticism to Prof. Bostrom's intellect; yet I hope it is an alarm we - the ones who spent most of our professional life programming computers, devising algorithms - have the duty to raise about today's ascension of philosophers who cannot mimic the approach of their predecessors who lived hundreds of years ago. Or simply put: there will be no other Leonardo Da Vinci because the technical society has evolved beyond the capacity of one individual to grasp entire disciplines and innovate in multiple domains. It is fair to say that even interdisciplinary fields produce people who may excel in one, maybe two, but not all. The same argument applies to philosophers: it is impossible to understand a discipline as sophisticated as any relying on mathematics without having a post-graduate understanding of the foundational field. So, I would like to give the author any credit for AI; unfortunately he has created an universe of technically ignorant disciples - and his fame has engaged other ""celebrities"" - also guilty of not understanding the science behind AI. Thus, I have given this book one start in admiration for Bostrom phenomenon, and worried sick about the influence of such powerful intellects on the young generation. If one can read Bostrom's book (and who couldn't?) then there will be the satisfaction of acquiring knowledge *about* AI - but sadly not proper AI knowledge. To understand AI from within takes many more years than to write books about AI; it is a tough road, with many bumps, deceptions, and illegible symbols and cryptic math. I believe when everybody will master that kind of mathematics, a book like this one may be welcome - until then I suggest we all read the first chapter of Magister Ludi (The Glass Bead Game) by Herman Hesse and A Discipline of Programming by Edsger Dijkstra. We are so close to our own destruction through glorified ignorance and lack of education.

BRIAN M THOMAS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning,My new #1 Python ML book!,"This is a fantastic book, even for a relative beginner to machine learning such as myself. The first thing that comes to mind after reading this book is that it was the perfect blend (for me at least) of theory and practice, as well as breadth and depth.

Let’s face it, we know that machine learning isn’t an easy subject. You need theory…but you also need practice in the form of some serious coding before you really start understanding it. And this is one area where Sebastian’s book shines: it contains a plethora of really good code examples that are illuminating and well explained, and which cover a very wide range of different machine learning algorithms. And, speaking of code, as another reviewer has pointed out, another huge plus is that, in many places, Sebastian shows you how to gauge the performance of your code and make it more efficient.

For me, the best measure of any book such as this is how many “ah ha!” moments I had while reading it. And I had more than a few while reading Sebastian’s book. One such “ah ha!” moment came while reading chapter 12 (and this also illustrates that nice blend of theory and practice I already mentioned above). In this particular chapter, he discusses training artificial neural networks for image recognition. At the heart of this approach is back propagation, which is pretty much THE bread and butter behind multilayered neural networks. He presents a detailed discussion of back propagation in two separate pieces: one that is intuitive and “top down”; the other a more mathematical, “bottoms up” approach that goes through the algorithm step by step, showing how the gradients are computed and the weights updated. His treatment of back propagation was one of the better explanations I’ve seen and really cleared things up for me.

One last thing I must mention: at the time of release, this was the first machine learning book for Python (to my knowledge) that has an entire chapter devoted to Theano, which he uses to parallelize neural network training. For those who don’t know, Theano is a particularly nice (not to mention very powerful) Python library for doing machine learning, most especially if you can utilize the power of GPU computing. In addition, that particular chapter (13) also introduces the brand new Python library named Keras, which is built on top of Theano and is a really nice library for the rapid building and prototyping of neural networks (in the spirit of Torch). Being a brand new library, his treatment of Keras was necessarily brief, but it was a great starting point.

In conclusion, I am very confident that if you do pick up this book, you won’t be at all disappointed. And be sure and grab the accompanying code for the book on his GitHub repository (just look for “python-machine-learning-book” on github.com/rasbt.) His code is top notch and I’ve yet to encounter any problems with it.",56
Panos_Ptr,5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning,Great Book.,"In my opinion this is a great book to get you up and running with machine learning. It manages to not only cover the basics but also talks about some of the more advanced topics.

There are a couple of things that I really liked about this book.

1. You learn a lot of things that you can't find online and that are APPLICABLE to the real world. Even if you just want to get into machine learning and use it but don't necessarily want to become a data scientist this is a great buy. Machine Learning can be really useful when put into good use. I for example, after reading the book, was able to quickly write up a python program to predict what time I would wake up based on what time I slept, what day it was etc. As well as having tons of fun playing with data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/ .

2. Although this book is focusing on python the math that you need to implement the algorithms are all there. What's great about that is that I was able to ""Translate"" most of the examples from the book to C++ code without much hustle. Not only that but the math behind these algorithms made a lot more sense after reading this book. So even if you don't necessarily want to use python but want to gain intuition over how these algorithms work this book will also come in handy.

3. This book isn't just about Machine Learning algorithms. It actually talks quite a bit about preparing and getting good data in general. Which is crucial for every data scientist since almost 80% of your job is getting good data. And another 20% finding a good model and training it.

Overall I would say that this book helped me and that I learnt a bunch of new things.

If the above didn't convince you (Along with other reviews) here are some small details that made the reading of this book a joyful experience.

- I felt that reading the book was actually really fun and motivating since at every chapter there were several examples of applying the theory taught. Which motivated me to move on and read more.

- Although this may not seem as important. I have to say that the font of the book as well as the tone of the writing made the reading of the book really comfortable and joyful. I didn't feel that I was getting tired and was easy for me to pick it up where I left off.

I have to say though that there where some typos here and there (I thing I found 2-3 in total as well as 2 pictures where swapped) but they were easy to spot so it wasn't that big of a problem.

Reasons why you shouldn't buy this book:
Unless you are a Machine Learning expert and you look into the deeper insights and more advanced stuff in Machine Learning you shouldn't be looking into buying this book since most of the stuff taught is already known to you. (Although I doubt that you would be looking through this reviews thinking whether to buy it or not in this case).

I have also included some pictures.

Great Book. Highly Recommend it!",17
Tyler Renelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning,Be sure you already know know ML & Python data tools.,"Great book! I would recommend buying this as PDF directly from packtpub. There's a lot of code, and it can get hairy in Kindle format. The author does have an iPython notebook repo, which makes following the code much nicer; but for reading in bed, not needing to switch back-n-forth, go PDF.

Make sure you already know (a) Machine Learning; (b) Python, NumPy, Pandas, iPython, Matplotlib. The author primers these a tad, but not enough for the uninitiated. If you're new, I'd recommend first taking Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning course; then find a book on Numpy + Pandas + Matplotlib (1 book will cover all 3). Then read this book.",12
Jim R,3.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning,Greatly degraded in Kindle format,"I would not recommend the Kindle edition because of the formatting of the book. All the equations, inline and standalone, are too small to read. The graphs are too small to read. You have to double click on each one to zoom in. Then you click to go back to page. This horrible formatting makes reading the book tiring and frustrating. The book gets a 1 star for the page layout making it difficult.

I don't understand how the publisher let this go. I will check samples carefully in the future to be sure not to get stuck with one of these duds again. I would advise anyone to try the epub format straight from the publisher. I can't say that is better, but can't imagine it could be worse.

The content was okay, but only left me looking for another book on the subject.

The examples are excellent working code case studies.

The balance of theory vs practice in the book wasn't right for me. I want to use Machine Learning. I do not intend to advance the field. While the math is interesting, it doesn't help a user decide what to do nor how to apply a method to a problem. Too much of the advice in the field seems to reduce to ""try it, vary the parameters, maybe it will do something for your problem"" or ""if that one doesn't work, here are others to try"". I realize that this may be state of the art, that people don't really know _why_ the various machine models work or don't work. But to move machine learning from a science experiment to a methodology with predictable outcomes, we need more books focused on practical advice.",12
Michael E,5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning,I decided on this book because of all the other good reviews. I have since picked up a few ...,"I'm a senior undergraduate student in electrical and computer engineering, and decided to make use of machine learning for my senior design project. Having had some experience in python (but not much with matplotlib or scipy), I decided on this book because of all the other good reviews. I have since picked up a few other books related to machine learning, but none can even compare to this. It's stellar! In three weeks I have managed to give myself a comprehensive crash course in classification algorithms using Python which is enough to give me a rolling start on my design project. I am about half way through the book, and apart from very few minor errors (to be expected in a first edition book), I cannot find any faults in it. It's a great resource for someone who wants to learn about machine learning but doesn't know where to start. I'm going to keep an eye out for further books by Mr. Raschka, because his ability to clearly and concisely explain things is superb. Additionally, I enjoy the fact that the book attempts to give a solid foundation on the mathematics behind various machine learning algorithms, since that is enjoyable for someone like me, who always likes to understand what is happening beneath the surface.

Update: Having finished the book now, I can definitely reaffirm my original position. This is one of the best technical books I have ever read. The last few chapters especially, image recognition with MLP networks and parallelizing networks with Theano and Keras are extremely interesting. I have taken these ideas and applied them in several of my own projects now. Also, as I'm planning on going to graduate school in the very near future, I'm thinking that machine learning and ANNs will likely be at the top of my list of areas to specialize in. The research that is going on in this field is huge, and this book manages to touch at the very base of neural networks, but enough to get your feet wet and show you where to go from there.",13

Sebastion explains the ML subjects very well. All the examples work fine and improve my understanding in ML a lot. When I did the Decision Tree section of chapter 3, I could even use the web version of Graphviz to display the resulting decision diagram.

Good illustration which is extremely easy to understand. Ofcourse, there would be things that you won't understand at all. For eg., if you are a beginner like I was, it would be difficult to gulp in the mathematical and conceptual concepts regarding the Gradient Descent Method, how Regularizations are used etc. Just watch a few Youtube vidoes by Andrew Ng and you'll catch all the concepts!

Adam Garza,5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning,An excellent book for machine learning and data science,"I'm a data scientist and I've read and actually worked the examples in at least 5 data science books looking for good reference/introduction material for my interns. This book is by far the best book I have come across. It's put to good use here in the office and the interns love it - some actually going so far as to purchase their own copies. To fully benefit from all it has to offer you'll need a solid background in mathematics(calculus and linear algebra) and python (or some other object-oriented programming language). This is not a beginner's book, and I'm confused by people who are surprised at that - it says as much in the preface. With the requisite background comfortably under your belt, you'll find that this book not only covers the machine learning algorithms popular in data science today, but also delves into other related and very necessary topics such as preprocessing, data compression, and parameter tuning. Too many data science books today give an overview of the algorithms themselves (albeit sometimes a very deep overview), but offer no (or very little) instruction on how to use them in a practical sense, as part of a workflow of some kind. This book does both beautifully.

Any book of this kind will contain errata. The only bad thing is that the publisher does a bad job of documenting them. Luckily the author keeps an updated and complete list on github. I suggest you go through the errata and make corrections in the book before you start reading it. There aren't too many, but it will keep you from getting stuck when your code doesn't run like it should.

The introductory chapter is mostly useless and does not provide much information on what Machine Learning is. It also bothers me how there are so many typos and some inconsistent notational usage. The codes are pretty helpful but at some point I got weary of reading about how to implement pre-written packages of the algorithms instead of actually implementing the algorithm (granted that the scikit-learn package is widely used in the ML community but it would help beginners to learn how to actually implement the algorithms instead of just blindly implementing the packages). I wish the author would also discuss more into details of the mathematical derivation and background as well as the motivations of some of the algorithms. This book should only be used only after taking an introductory course in ML (I highly recommend Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera).

-I already know most of the algorithms for having written them during different courses so I found it a bit long to have to go through them all over again (but others, more detailed oriented may find the actual implementation interesting)
-Sometimes, the book attempts to cram in too much (the portion about Flask web design is a bit pushing too much in another direction)
-the part on Deep Learning and signal processing is a bit too light for my taste even if in some ways above the crop (especially for the Theanos and Keras parts that provide a good introduction to these libraries).

The book has a few useful nuggets, but largely lacks depth and big picture orientation to help master scikit-learn and ML. It really doesn't serve any audience well. You would be much better served by reading a classic like Elements of Statistical Learning or Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective. If you need something easier, try Introduction to Statistical Learning. For scikit-learn, the excellent documentation is likely your best bet. The author often refers you to the literature instead of explaining how things work in any detail beyond the most superficial level of detail.",9
A. Chaudry,4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning,Great scikit-learn (Python) reference. Publisher still needs work on their template/graphics,"Update 11/2/2015:

Finally got the replacement from Amazon. This one is in perfect shape, i.e., no alignment issues at all. Woohoo! Just as promised. For other details, please see my 10/29/15 review below.

Update 10/29/2015:

After having a conversation with the author (see comments), I'm updating my review. Here are some updated remarks on my original comments:

I've been pushed a new copy from Amazon and promised properly aligned pages. I took 2 stars off for the misaligned pages (I'm emailing a picture of these to the author), but I'm giving these stars back because - as per our conversation - my copies were outliers and hopefully the new copy I receive will be properly printed. The three copies the author has are printed properly and mine shouldn't have been different.

I'm also adding a star back because the author explained how the publisher/graphics team didn't do their job right. In conclusion, I'm taking off just one star because the whole 'package' I received isn't how I expected to be, but this isn't a poor reflection on the author. Actually, it's quite the contrary, and I stand by my statement that his content, ideas, thoughts, code and plots do their job well. The breadth of information is immense, and the depth on each topic is enough that I would consider this a great scikit-learn reference.

Original review 10/26/2015 (deprecated):

I didn't want to give this a bad review, trust me. I believe the content is great, the author has done a good job, and he's clearly knowledgeable on the subject matter. The content seems strong, covers a wide-variety of topics, and is a great reference on the Python scikit-learn package. I'm not sure one would be able to learn machine learning from this book alone, primarily because it's actually a reference on scikit-learn, but also because the algorithms are not implemented from scratch and instead covered in concept (and implemented in sklearn with examples here and there). As a reference to sklearn, this book does its job well.

My issue is with the publisher and the editors. EVERY page is printed misaligned, i.e., not printed parallel to the paper. More alarmingly, opposite pages are misaligned in OPPOSITE directions, giving the perception that the pages are misaligned more than they really are! It's horribly distracting while reading the content. I thought it was a one-off thing, but I have seen this in two copies so far. I took off 2 stars for this.

The other issue is with the formatting of the book. Have a look at the contents, for example; there is no line-spacing before or after chapter titles. Going through the contents section feels like I'm reading strange prose with italics, bold and underlined text thrown in here and there. I have to pretty much actively parse the entire contents to find what I'm looking for, or give up in the contents and jump back to the index. It's an annoying, utterly unsatisfying experience and pushes me away from the book. I took a star off here.

The final thing wrong with this book are the illustrations. The charts/plots themselves are okay; they seem to be implemented in matplotlib, our go-to Python plotting library. They do their job, but definitely lack a certain je ne sais quoi. I guess they could've been prettier (think Bokeh or ggplot plotting libraries), but like I said I'm neutral on this. My problem is with the conceptual illustrations. That is, when the author is explaining machine learning or data science concepts, he seems to rely on what looks like MS PowerPoint 2003 or older to build out his diagrams. These plots are so 2003 that I have a hard time gleaning the concepts they're trying to push across. I'm sure the editors could've easily spent some more time recreating these charts in a newer version of PowerPoint (maybe with 2010+ design principles), or even better, in an actual graphic-design platform. Imagine browsing webpages on a Palm Pilot after using an iPhone/Android device for the last decade or so. You're not going to like it, it's going to slow you down, and maybe it'll even impede learning; this is what the illustrations are like. Ugh - I really wish the author, publisher or editor hadn't used the default template on PowerPoint 2003. Puts a bad taste in my mouth every time I think about it. Minus one star for this.",8

RA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning,You need this book!,"This book primarily consists of 3 things:

Statistics - Intermediate to Advanced
Python (Data) - Intermediate to Advanced
Machine Learning concepts - Beginner to Advanced

Having come from a non-technical background, I can say that this book does a wonderful job of not being too about ""theory"", and focusing on practical ML applications (as good of a job as a book of this type can be). Though the statistics and Python functions can be a bit intimidating right off the bat, it's never ""overbearing"", which I really liked. While I wouldn't recommend this book to someone with no experience in ML, Python, or Mathematics, I would recommend this to someone who has already gotten their feet wet in the aforementioned topics, and want something to take them to the deep end of the pool.

This book is the kind you read and put on the shelf as a sort of reference manual for all your future endeavors. Sebastian does such a great job walking you through everything from the underlying math behind various classes and algorithms, to showing you how to write your own supervised algorithms right in Python.

As someone who came to Python, and Machine Learning a while ago, from a non-technical background, I honestly ""could not"" have spent better money. I highly recommend this book if you want to take your Python and ML chops to the next level.",2

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning,"Nice Effort, But Divided Priorities Trip Up This Title","Context for this review: I have over 20 years professional experience in inferential statistics / machine learning.

This book is an introduction to machine learning via the Python programming language.

Good:
- Unlike some other machine learning titles, this one includes explanation of alternative error functions.
- Mention of a variety of libraries beyond the popular few, such as Theanos and Keras.
- Some exploration of GPU computing, with enough detail to permit the reader to experiment with this.

Bad:
- The machine learning coverage is broad but shallow. This is too ambitious for a single book (given that half of the book is on Python)?
- Coverage of data sampling (from the statistical universe) is non-existent.
- The index is inadequate.
- Instructions for installation of Python math/machine learning libraries were meager.

Note:
Despite other Amazon reviews, I found the formatting to be fine, and the diagrams to be perfectly suitable. If there were issues in these departments, I suspect they've been ironed out.

Bottom line: This book tries to serve two masters: It proposes to teach machine learning, then implementation of the same within Python. My long experience with such books is that they provide a luke-warm version of each (at best). This title continues that pattern.",23

John Mount,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",Actually does something (huge) with the math,"I have been using The Elements of Statistical Learning for years, so it is finally time to try and review it.

The Elements of Statistical Learning is a comprehensive mathematical treatment of machine learning from a statistical perspective. This means you get good derivations of popular methods such as support vector machines, random forests, and graphical models; but each is developed only after the appropriate (and wrongly considered less sexy) statistical framework has already been derived (linear models, kernel smoothing, ensembles, and so on).

In addition to having excellent and correct mathematical derivations of important algorithms The Elements of Statistical Learning is fairly unique in that it actually uses the math to accomplish big things. My favorite examples come from Chapter 3 ""Linear Methods for Regression."" The standard treatments of these methods depend heavily on respectful memorization of regurgitation of original iterative procedure definitions of the various regression methods. In such a standard formulation two regression methods are different if they have superficially different steps or if different citation/priority histories. The Elements of Statistical Learning instead derives the stopping conditions of each method and considers methods the same if they generate the same solution (regardless of how they claim they do it) and compares consequences and results of different methods. This hard use of isomorphism allows amazing results such as Figure 3.15 (which shows how Least Angle Regression differs from Lasso regression, not just in algorithm description or history: but by picking different models from the same data) and section 3.5.2 (which can separate Partial Least Squares' design CLAIM of fixing the x-dominance found in principle components analysis from how effective it actually is as fixing such problems).

The biggest issue is who is the book for? This is a mathy book emphasizing deep understanding over mere implementation. Unlike some lesser machine learning books the math is not there for appearances or mere intimidating typesetting: it is there to allow the authors to organize many methods into a smaller number of consistent themes. So I would say the book is for researchers and machine algorithm developers. If you have a specific issue that is making inference difficult you may find the solution in this book. This is good for researchers but probably off-putting for tinkers (as this book likely has methods superior to their current favorite new idea). The interested student will also benefit from this book, the derivations are done well so you learn a lot by working through them.

Finally- don't buy the kindle version, but the print book. This book is satisfying deep reading and you will want the advantages of the printed page (and Amazon's issues in conversion are certainly not the authors' fault).",46

Matt Grosso,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)","excellent overview, especially for outsiders, ties the field together conceptually","This review is written from the perspective of a programmer who has sometimes had the chance to choose, hire, and work with algorithms and the mathematician/statisticians that love them in order to get things done for startup companies. I don't know if this review will be as helpful to professional mathematicians, statisticians, or computer scientists.

The good news is, this is pretty much the most important book you are going to read in the space. It will tie everything together for you in a way that I haven't seen any other book attempt. The bad news is you're going to have to work for it. If you just need to use a tool for a single task this book won't be worth it; think of it as a way to train yourself in the fundamentals of the space, but don't expect a recipe book. Get something in the ""using R"" series for that.

When it came out in 2001 my sense of machine learning was of a jumbled set of recipes that tended to work in some cases. This book showed me how the statistical concepts of bias, variance, smoothing and complexity cut across both fields of traditional statistics and inference and the machine learning algorithms made possible by cheaper cpus. Chapters 2-5 are worth the price of the book by themselves for their overview of learning, linear methods, and how those methods can be adopted for non-linear basis functions.

The hard parts:

First, don't bother reading this book if you aren't willing to learn at least the basics of linear algebra first. Skim the second and third chapters to get a sense for how rusty
your linear algebra is and then come back when you're ready.

Second, you really really want to use the SQRRR technique with this book. Having that glimpse of where you are going really helps guide you're understanding when you dig in for real.

Third, I wish I had known of R when I first read this; I recommend using it along with some sample data sets to follow along with the text so the concepts become skills not just
abstract relationships to forget. It would probably be worth the extra time, and I wish I had known to do that then.

My low rating is more for the general notion that this book is good for those that want to learn machine learning.

I cannot comment about any of the alternatives, however I am quite pleased with this book. I especially like how refined the layout is. The book is full of blue chapter and section headings in addition to many intelligently colored plots.

Yeng C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",A pedagogical disaster. This book is written for only one audience: people who hold Ph.D.s in statistics.,"This book is a pedagogical disaster. It is essentially a bunch of topics lumped into one book, with unclear explanations and notation.

I am speaking particularly to the linear regression section. I took two linear models courses in a graduate-level statistics program, and I can say I finally understand the material in here. But the explanations are extremely poor. Note I didn't say poor - but beyond poor. The authors attest that they ""expect that the reader will have had at least one elementary course in statistics, covering basic topics including linear regression."" This seems to suggest that any student who has taken freshman-level/AP-level statistics can handle this material.

Yes, I agree with everyone, you need linear algebra and some mathematical maturity. But not only do you need linear algebra and mathematical maturity, you need much more than that: you need a substantial background in linear models, to even understand how in the world you find a variance-covariance matrix or expected value or a random vector, to understand why N-p-1 is the degrees of freedom for the unbiased estimator of the variance, to understand how in the world one defines differentiating with respect to the beta vector, and perhaps most importantly, to understand that the estimate of the response vector is H * y, H denoting the projection matrix onto the column space of X or the hat matrix.

Some may argue, this book isn't about the ""how"" and that I'm arguing too much about the theory, and that this is more of an ""applied"" book. Simply put, no matter what math or stats book I read, if I can't figure out the results that come out of a book using what is in the text itself and whatever prerequisites are suggested by the text, then it's a crappy textbook. You can't read this book with an elementary statistics background. Furthermore, I don't know anyone with only an elementary statistics background who could understand taking derivatives with respect to a vector.

I don't recommend this book unless you have an excellent grasp in linear model theory. Introduction to Statistical Learning, contrary to popular belief, is not a good prerequisite for this book. I recommend reading Plane Answers to Complex by Christensen, or any similar book, before reading this text.",11

Tony Hong,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)","not a learning textbook for outsiders, but good for reference","I have finished reading the book, but I feel somewhat confused...

Although I think I did pretty good with math in graduate school (Physics PhD from a good school), I find it hard to follow some of the derivations. The book specified the prerequisite level of one elementary course of statistics and some linear algebra. But I feel the actual requirement for math is much higher, especially in the multivariate statistics and matrix representations. I often find myself staring at the formulas and trying to get the big picture.

This book is particularly good in terms of grabbing the insights and intuitions underneath the different methods. It covers a vast majority of different techniques, and trying to present the ideas and intuitions why this method works or how this method is an implementation of a simpler idea, e.g.various obvious or hidden implementations of lasso regularization. This is impressive. No one can do better because the authors are actually leading researchers who either invented these ideas or made significant contributions to their development.

Unfortunately, this book is not a textbook for outsiders of machine learning research. The actual implementations/algorithm are not covered in detail, provided often as-is, and have weak links to the presented formulas. The indices or notations in the formulas are sometimes not mentioned, and some of the key concepts for understanding the principles are not introduced. I presume researchers in this field would usually have a common sense of what they are, but for someone like me, it is sometimes very difficult to follow.

Anyway, it is great to finish this book. I don't know how much I could get from this book, but at least I have some feelings of how deep and how broad this field is, and know where to look if later I encounter problems. I would recommend an outside learner to step away from this book as a principle textbook and only use it as a reference.

If you're like me, you'll also have to do some googling around for some of the stats stuff he talks about (confidence intervals, chi squared distribution...). I personally don't mind this. The coverage of this book is truly amazing. Trevor talks about everything from the lasso and ridge regression to knn, SVM's, ensemble methods, and random forests. It's fun to just flip to a random page and just start reading. If you want to be an expert in this area, you need to have this book.

But be prepared to read it very slowly and digest each page. Its greatest strength is that it shows how much of modern statistics comes down to a few fundamental issues: bias, variance, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. There is no free lunch in statistics, methods that claim to avoid these tradeoffs only do so by adding more assumptions about the structure of your data. If your data match the assumptions of such methods, you gain statistical power, but if your data don't match the assumptions then you lose.

By looking closely at the assumptions, the book shows how many contemporary methods that look different are fundamentally similar under the hood.

And in my own work I have adopted their use of open circles for the points in scatterplots. These circles are easier to see than tiny solid dots, but overlapping symbols don't cover each other the way large filled symbols do.",15

Their book covers a broad range of topics and is filled with applications. Much new material has been added since the first edition was published in 2001. Since most of these procedures have been implemented in the open-source program R, this book provides a basic and needed reference for their application. Important estimation procedures discussed include MARS, GAM, Projection Pursuit, Exploratory Projection Pursuit, Random Forest, General Linear Models, Ridge Models and Lasso Models etc. There is an discussion of bagging and boosting and how these techniques can be used. There is an extensive index and the many of the datasets discussed are available from the web page of the book or from other sources on the web. Each chapter has a number of problems that test mastery of the material. I have used material from this book in a number of graduate classes at the University of Illinois in Chicago and have implemented a number of the techniques in my software system B34S. While the 1969 book by Box and Jenkins set the stage for time series analysis using ARIMA and Transfer Function Models, Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman have produced the classic reference for a wide range of new and important techniques in the area of Machine Learning. For anyone interested in Data Mining this is a must own book.",9
Governor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",Full of Pleasant Surprises,"I originally bought this book for coverage of some topics about which I know nothing. But having had it for just a week, I have been more impressed with what I have learned about stuff that I thought I knew. The material in Chapter 7 is one of several cases in point. The discussion of cross validation is great, and the way it is related to other aspects of the model selection problem is masterly. More generally, the book manages a nice balance between theory and application, and its scope is truly impressive. Thanks to authors and publisher.",1
S. Matthews,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",my big brown book of statistic learning tools,"This is a quite interesting, and extremely useful book, but it is wearing to read in large chunks. The problem, if you want to call it that, is that it is essentially a 700 page catalogue of clever hacks in statistical learning. From a technical point of view it is well-ehough structured, but there is not the slightest trace of an overarching philosophy. And if you don't actually have a philosophical perspective in place before you start, the read you face might well be an even harder grind. Be warned.

Some of the reviews here complain that there is too much math. I don't think that is an issue. If you have decent intuitions in geometry, linear algebra, probability and information theory, then you should be able to cruise through and/or browse in a fairly relaxed way. If you don't have those intuitions, then you are attempting to read the wrong book.

There were a couple of things that I expected (things I happen to know a bit about), but that were missing. On the unsupervised learning side, the discussion of Gaussian mixture clustering was, I thought, a bit short and superficial, and did not bring out the combination of theoretical and practical power that the method offers. On the supervised learning side, I was surprised that a book that dedicates so much time to linear regression finds no room for a discussion of Gaussian process regression as far as I could see (the nearest point of approach is the use of Gaussian radial basis functions [oops: having written that, I immediately came across a brief discussion (S5.8.1) of, essentially, GP regression - though with no reference to standard literature]).",17
Brian James,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",,"I am a physician who is interested in data science as a way to analyze health outcomes. I am new to this field, but in undergrad I took three semesters of calculus, differential equations and graduate-level statistics courses (and I made A's in all of them except the differential equations course). This book is definitely not geared towards beginners or anyone who does not hold an advanced degree in mathematics or statistics. I also have about four years of programming experience, notwithstanding that I am rusty.

That said, I am having an extremely difficult time parsing the information in this book, as it consists mainly of mathematical jargon with little explanation of anything. I would definitely not recommend this book as a didactic textbook for beginners or even intermediate level learners in this field.

I am sure the authors are very knowledgeable in this field, but this book is not a good textbook to learn from. To quote the authors ""We expect that the reader will have had at least one elementary course in statistics, covering basic topics including linear regression."" I have to call BS on this, as I never had any trouble in my classes (or learning directly from textbooks without instruction) and this book is just killing me.",14

""Learning"" in this book's context is really about the collection of statistics, which is akin to mentioning the ""AI"" buzzword. The bottom-line is that a human must design, and at least post-process/post-supervise the collection of the statistics for real work to get done; so don't think you'll be designing super robots after reading this book that have a soul. ;-)

XYZ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)","Unfortunately, not a great book","The fact that this is a leading book in Statistical Learning is sad since it hardly makes any efforts to be accessible to people from different backgrounds who might want to learn about statistical learning techniques by reading this book. There is not a single appendix at the end of the book. The notation in the book is horrendous and the authors make no effort to be explicit about it more than once or sometimes not even once. I can give many examples of terms being used in the book which have not been defined even once. One example would be about standardizing predictors in linear regression. This has not been explicitly defined anywhere in the book. You can of course find out what that means by googling, but many other such cases make the book hardly self-contained. Overall, I find the authors' capability to explain stuff quite poor (having also taken Prof. Hastie's class at Stanford (I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering)).

I give this book 3 stars since it is a valuable collection about different techniques, though I had to end up turning to other resources to understand them.",11
Ryan S.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",Who is this aimed at?,"Echoing the complaints I've read in other reviews, this book might be good as a reference for people who are already familiar with the material, but the authors seem to try to cram too much new information into the pages for a newcomer to the field to be able to retain most of it. There are too many algorithms compared, and the authors don't devote much space to providing explanations or intuition. I wish I'd taken the advice of another reviewer that this book is not aimed at newcomers to the field before purchasing.",7
Doaa,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",Not enough!,"Needs a lot of statistical background. I don't know why buy For any topic, this book alone was not enough!

Alberto Garciatunon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",This is a great book for someone that understands the notation used,"I would strongly dissuade anyone from buying this book. Approximately 50% of the book is mathematical notation and the author minimally defines the notation that he employs. This is a great book for someone that understands the notation used, but if you are not well versed in symbols then this might as well be Greek. The mathematics itself is not difficult, but the terms that he uses require substantial on-line research. The author also changes the meanings for certain symbols without informing the reader. To me, it appears that he is almost purposefully attempting to obfuscate the material. He definitively targets mathematical PhD students at the expense of other types of students. I am finishing up a Masters in Analytics and this was the worst book that we read thus far. Multi-factor and logistic regression are fairly straightforward concepts and it is laughable how the author overcomplicates such benign material. I question the author's ability to actually apply these concepts in a practical business setting.

These types of books will cease to exist in a few years as new ones emerge that actually explain and teach these concepts in a lucid manner. I am actually speaking with a publisher about publishing such a book. If you truly wish to understand these concepts AVOID THIS TOME!",4

SP,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",,"I have three texts in machine learning (Duda et. al, Bishop, and this one), and I can unequivocally say that, in my judgement, if you're looking to learn the key concepts of machine learning, this one is by far the worst of the three. Quite simply, it reads almost as a research monologue, only with less explanation and far less coherence. There's little/no attempt to demystify concepts to the newcomer, and the exposition is all over the map. There simply isn't a clear, coherent path that the authors set out to go on in writing a given chapter of this text; it's as if they tried to squeeze every bit of information of the most recent results into the chapter, with little regard to what such a decision might do to the overall readability of the text and the newcomer's understanding. To people who might disagree with me on this point, I'd recommend reading a chapter in Bishop's text and comparing it to similar content in this one, and I think you'll at least better appreciate my viewpoint, if not agree with it.

So you might be wondering, why do I even own the text given my opinion? Well, two reasons: (1) it cost 25 dollars through Springer and a contract they have with my university (definitely look into this before buying on Amazon!), and (2) if you actually already know the concepts, it is quite useful as a summary of what's out there. So to those who understand the basics of machine learning, and also have exposure to greedy algorithms, convex optimization, wavelets, and some other often-utilized methods in the text, this makes for a pretty good reference.

The authors are definitely very well-known researchers in the field, who in particular have written some good papers on a variety of machine learning topics (l1-norm penalized regression, analysis of boosting, to name just two), and thus this book naturally will attract some buzz. It may be very useful to someone like myself who is already familiar with much of what's in the book, or someone who is an expert in the field and just uses it as a quick reference. As a pedagogical tool, however, I think it's pretty much a disaster, and feel compelled to write this as to prevent the typical buyer -- who undoubtedly is buying it to learn and not to use as a reference -- from wasting a lot of money on the wrong text.",124
Mike H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,"Buy it, love it, share it.","Seriously, if you are the kind of person who needs to understand where things came from to really understand them, this is a great book. It is truly a book on code, and not just ""how to code"" or ""what to do with code"" but ""what on earth is code"" and where did it come from. It explains computers and computing in more usable terms than more technical books on the same subject because it focuses on history and scope rather than technical depth. For a reader like me, who asked every teacher from elementary school through college ""why do we count to 10"" and clung to the best answer of ""it's arbitrary - it's just how it's always been done"" until reading this book (and who struggled to convert binary to base ten), this book was gold. Pure gold.",10
Amanda,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,GREAT book!,"I've been programming for years now, but have never had a great understanding of what's really going on in a computer to make it work. Sure, I had the vague idea that there were lots of transistors, and components like RAM, ROM, operating systems, etc... but I had no understanding of how these components actually worked, or how they all tied in together. I've been meaning to really sit down and learn what's going on, but was overwhelmed by the magnitude of terms to look up.

Then came this book... This book is EXACTLY what I was looking for. Petzold builds gradually on each of his previous chapters, so all of the content is very understandable and accessible. He is very clear in his language and explanations, and I found it remarkably easy to follow. There were a few chapters (most toward the beginning) where I had trouble seeing the relevance of why he was explaining something like Morse Code, but was very pleasantly surprised when he tied it flawlessly into his larger narrative.

If you studied electrical engineering or computer engineering, you'll probably already have a solid grasp of what he's explaining in this book. (Though it's still a wonderful whole-spectrum explanation of what's going on under the hood!) And if you did not study anything of the sort, there's a great chance you'll learn a whole lot from Petzold.

If you're on the fence about this book, I absolutely recommend it, and in fact will be recommending it to my friends and colleagues who are in the same boat.",6
A. Menon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Extremely well motivated introduction to how computer harware works,"Code is a fantastic casual introduction to computer science. The author takes the interested reader through concepts like number systems, information encoding, electricity, computer hardware, computer architecture, software including operating systems, computer languages from Assembly to high level languages and some input output device analysis. It is a remarkable accomplishment in a relatively short number of pages.

The author starts by asking the reader how they would go about communicating with a friend at some distance with only a flashlight. From such a basic problem starting point the author introduces ways in which people have encoded information and how efficiently that information is encoded. The reader learns about morse code and braille. Then bits are introduced and the author shows the reader how the base of a number system is quite arbitrary and then introduces ideas in binary. The reader is introduced to basic Boolean logic and how information can be encoded in binary very naturally. The author then goes to show how one can build adding machines from basic logic devices and then introduces complement arithmetic to show how subtraction can be done using a binary adding machine. The author then moves on to some basic circuit elements and shows how latches can be made to store bits. From latches the author moves on to flip flops and discusses how a clock can be used to sequence logic. The author then gets into registers and basic computer architecture. The reader is shown some early chip designs and what functions they included. In the process of learning Von Neumann architecture we learn about memory, the bus, the program counter and eventually move in to operating systems. After aspects of that are introduced the reader learns about fixed and floating point numbers as well as computer languages and compilers. Eventually the author introduces how graphical interfaces were developed such that computers became interactive devices for the users rather than pure computational devices.

I read this book while taking a course on basic computer architecture so I had the fortune of having two sources for instruction. In reading this alongside/after a more formal course I feel like the material of the course is slightly more easily absorbed as this book brings life to what can sometimes be a terse subject. Definitely think it can be read on its own or as a intro to what can become a very difficult subject very quickly.",3
B.K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,A gem.,"This is a pure gem. The author basically takes you on a journey of code and computer evolution through different periods and different applications. It's definitely a joy to read. If you know a lot about computers (I'm a software engineer), then you might not learn a whole lot of new concepts, but that does not mean that you are not going to enjoy reading this -- it's just one of those great reads, period. I'll bet that even more knowledgeable individuals will pick up some fascinating things from this book. I am not exaggerating when I say that this is one of the best computer science related books I've ever read in my entire life. The writing style is so incredibly approachable, with amazingly clear and simple examples and explanations. I wish some of my textbooks while getting my Computer Science degree were as good as this. I'm simply blown away and sad, at the same time, because it's so hard to find such amazing books.",2

I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to understand how computers work on a fundamental level, without all the abstractions, at a bare metal level. It covers some earlier processors but nothing specific. It speaks more in generalities, which is good if you don't want to lock yourself down to a particular machine, but want to build your own from scratch.",3
ANDREW L ORTLIEB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Brilliant concise explanations. A great read regardless of your experience level.,"I have over ten years field experience as a programmer, but it wasn't until recently that I read this book and actually understood what I was making the hardware do. This book absolutely demystifies digital logic, RAM and microprocessors. Charles Petzold does a brilliant job explaining how hardware works and how software progressed over the decades. He explains these things with such clarity and astonishingly few words.

The author frequently jumps into very important history of technology and people who pioneered the technology, which is not only interesting, but also gives a great angle on the reasons for the way technology has progressed.

I believe this book should be a fun read for someone with very limited experience with computer software and hardware, and perhaps that this should be required reading for anyone interested in Computer Science or Computer Engineering.",3
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,fantastic read,"I've been programming for about 10 years at this point. I started as a lowly Web Designer fresh out of High School and through a series of jobs, opportunities, necessity, and general interest in computers I've become a full time developer working in a multitude of languages for the past 8 years. Initially I had worked in higher level languages, as I learned more and more about how they worked I drilled down through the various aspects of computers (reverse engineering, understanding assembly, etc.) but I didn't really have a firm grasp on hardware. My learning preference is to start and the basics and work my way up adding layers of knowledge on layers of previous knowledge, it helps me visualize and understand abstracts more easily. I'd started reading some Electrical Engineering books, basic circuits, understanding Voltage, Current, Resistance, Ohms, Capacitors, Circuit Diagrams, etc. But still felt a little fuzzy in a lot of regards of how they'd come together, I'd purchased and played with Arduinos and breadboards, built crude circuits, and use microcontrollers and still felt fuzzy about how it all ""really"" came together, all the while this book sat on my Kindle (used to have a Kindle format, not sure why it's gone now...) unread as a ""some day"" goal.

Recently sick of reading EE books and CS related stuff I was looking for a more abstract ""lighter"" read during my lazy day in the park and decided to read the first few pages of CODE... I wish I had gotten around to it months ago! This book is fantastic, it's entertaining yes, but more importantly it's very clear, concise, and really appeals to my aforementioned learning style. You literally start with the basics in each regard and work your way up through each chapter. This isn't a skim or reference book, it's a cover to cover read and you'll be a better engineer/programmer/technofile for it. I'd recommend everyone even remotely interested in computers and how they work give this book a read, and especially recommend anyone venturing into the CS field to give it a good once over.

I'd give it 10 stars if I could.",10

Brandon Bennett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Wonderful read. Not only does it do a great ...,"Wonderful read. Not only does it do a great job of explaining how a computer computes but it was very entertaining and easy to read. It starts a very low level describing number/encoding with the best description of binary I think i have read. It builds slowly with examples of electricity, basic circuits, logic gates with each chapter building on the last until you finally build a computer in your mind and have a pretty good understanding.

Unlike some of the other reviews I would say that some knowledge of electronics and computers but the author does a great job of not assuming anything, but not being completely bored if you have a better understanding. I will say the entire book was brilliant minus the last chapter which i recommend just skipping. It's a high level chapter that just mentions briefly a lot of encoding and programming languages without going into any detail.

For a book that is now, at time of this review, 15 years old it holds up well and you can get a chuckle from when he mentions that 256MB of ram , common for a home PC, is ""under $300""",1
Ryan McNamara,4.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Changes pretty dramatically after a few chapters.,"Let me revise my previous review with a few brief things to say about this.

First, this book has a lot of pictures and diagrams and you'll want to frequently go back to them and take your time. For this reason, it's probably a pretty bad idea to buy the kindle version.

Second, this books starts out as super-light reading (for me anyway) and then starts getting much harder and denser. For that reason I can't give it 5-stars. The preview you get for your kindle might be misleading for that reason. The pacing, in my opinion, was too slow in the beginning and too fast in the middle.

You'll want to take your time with this book. This is very close to a Malcolm Gladwell or Freakonomics style book, but it's not quite.

But, on the other hand, this really is a good book if you want to learn about this sort of thing. Unlike Gladwell or Freakonomics, you really are learning stuff. I see no reason why this couldn't be used in a college course, but it won't feel like you're reading a textbook. For what it is, it's extremely accessible. And I don't think there's another book quite like this, certainly not of this quality. It is extremely well written. I did wind up taking a few flashcards, though, since it is harder than other books that follow the template of: ""one-syllable-word: the amazing hidden side of superlative everythingness."" But it's still done in a style that is very close to that. And you'll actually learn things that are true, and not figure out a later after you read the book that studies were misrepresented and facts distorted to fit the narrative of the book.

So that's why I revised this review. I know a bit more than I did when I first wrote it and my expectations of what the book is has changed, too. I'm going to buy whatever this guy puts out next. Four stars only because the pacing was a little off and it might not be exactly what you expect it is from the first couple of chapters. If you want to actually learn about how computers work, there has never been a book this well-written. But you do have to actually want to know how computers work.",11
Wyatt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,The ULTIMATE Computer Bible!!,"I am shocked by the amount of effort put into Code. You can tell this book was fabricated to the curious and tech savvy learners who wish to better grasp the bare essentials of computing. Charles Petzold uses a story telling narrative to explain the inner workings of all computers. This book differs from the average study book used by student in the major. It drags you into the true story as if the book were fictional. From the telegraph to how a microprocessor calculates math, Code will be a memorable book for every computer hobbyist.",1
Austen D. Hoogen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,"This is the ONE book that everyone should read, technophobes and computer professionals alike.","My mother read the cover and immediately said, ""That's way beyond me."" The shame of this attitude is she will likely not read this wonderful, informative, insightful and thoroughly entertaining book! I must try and convince her to discard her preconceptions. This is what I will say to her after having read the book for myself.

Code assumes you know absolutely nothing about computers, nothing about electronics (other than that they exist) and nothing about ""code.""

Charles Petzold takes you on a time-travel exploration of some of the most significant scientific discoveries from the Medieval, a spattering of ancient Greek and Arabic discoveries, the Renaissance, and ends with Technologies of the mid to late 1980s. You take this journey using nothing but the technology available at the time, with the exception of one futuristic bit of technology: Edison's 1879 invention, the lightbulb.

Equipped with this ""Advanced Technology"" Petzold guides you, step by step and piece by piece through the process of how a computer works. And you fully understand how a computer ""works"" with nothing more than wire, buttons and lightbulbs in your technological arsenal. He won't even mention the word ""transistor"" until half-way through the book (and only in passing), let alone talk about transistors in any detail for the first 247 pages of the book.

Everyone has something to gain from this book. Even software engineers like me. I was a hobbyist electronics enthusiast when I was a kid, and I read all the books on electronics I could get my hands on. I knew what all the components were. I knew how to read schematics. I even knew how transistors worked and what digital logic gates were. But I struggled with making the connection from AND, OR, NAND, NOR and XOR gates (nobody bothered to mention INVERTERS to me) to being useful, functional digital circuits.

Charles Petzold single-handedly erased a 25 year gap in my understanding of how computers really work on a fundamental level. And I love that he did it in a way that is so accessible my mother can understand this technology, and that we can now have a shared experience around it.",7
Ratz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,"Truly Excellent, but alot of filler toward the end","This book is truly wonderful, and might be the best informational book I've ever read. It starts off by explaining electricity running through wires and works it's way up until you can understand machine code. And to anyone whose taken a college course in computer architecture and understands something about machine code and how higher level computer languages compile into machine code, this book will be truly enlightening as you will then understand what happens (mostly) from when you click a button on your screen, down to the silicon inside your computer.

If you have ever wanted to know how a piece of metal is able to do calculations GET THIS BOOK, it is almost perfect.

That being said the only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because of the latter chapters. The book does an excellent job working its way up to the electromechanical computer, but after that all of the chapters felt like non-sequiturs. They had some interesting bits of information but they didn't fell anywhere as coherent to the overall goal of the book as the early chapters did, and the thing is they weren't even that necessary really. The quickening of pace and increasing brevity becomes all too obvious by the very end of the book where the wrap up for the entire text is only ONE SENTENCE long! Reading them (the latter chapters) felt like getting forced to eat a freezer burned ice cream after the most perfect dinner you've ever eaten. Point and case: They detracted from the overall experience.

However since the book does execute its intended function almost perfectly, I have to give it four stars.",1
Peter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,If you are in IT whether its programming or administration this book is a must read.,"If you are a programmer you will get the most out of this book. Its a fantastic low level overview of how the digital world works. It is absolutely amazing, you start out learning the basics of electrical engineering from, and how a bit is either on or off (which realistically we all knew). Petzold relays the information in a really easy to understand way, and it will blow your mind how a bit can be turned into a logic gate that then goes onto a track to become a computer, or programming language. If you are an admin you need to read this to understand how computers work on a very low level. You will probably never use any of this information proper (in a sys admin position at least) but it will give you an amazing perspective to trouble shoot programming and systems issues.

Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Read if you want a basic understanding of exactly how and why a computer works,"As a self-taught programmer, I have only ever understood how to make a computer do something with a new-fangled modern high-level language. I sought out a book to help me understand what is going on underneath, and Code does exactly that. The book begins by introducing yesteryear methods for encoding data before the electronic age such as Morse Code and Braille, and walks you through the technological leaps that have occurred since. Telegraph-era hardware is built on the page wire-by-wire until a functional model of a modern computer has been fully constructed. The tedious pains of coding directly into the machine with actual binary input is introduced, and then the advancements of assembly languages, low-level abstract languages, and finally high-level compiled languages. In addition you'll learn how to count and do basic arithmetic in binary and hexadecimal, the history of character encoding, and take your imaginary computer from switch controlled calculator to text operated number cruncher and finally modern GUI operated home computer.

The book is not written as a dry textbook, but rather as if your really smart friend were to sit down and explain the history of computing to your really smart teenager. There are charts of boolean logic gate outputs, binary math tables, and electronic schematics which will likely scare off anyone who isn't seriously interested in learning the details, but the tone of the book is very informal and easy to read, and moves at just the right pace. It doesn't just throw new concepts at you without fully introducing the underpinnings, but it also doesn't spoon-feed the information to you and dwell on any one area too long. Written in 1999, the book dates itself when referring to benchmarks in computing at that point in time, but for those of us who have never seen an IBM punchcard, weren't alive when the Altair 8800 was introduced, and take terabytes of hard drive space for granted, this is an invaluable history lesson that will aid your understanding of everything a computer does.",4
danteigla,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,This book will teach you to understand computers at their core,"This is the only book I've ever read that truly helped me understand the way computer technology evolved from seeds in the Industrial Revolution to the present day. It's definitely not an ""easy"" read if you aren't at all mathematically or programatically inclined - but it's WAY more accessible than most books on the subject, and will absolutely get you thinking in ways you may not have before. A great read, and one I'd recommend to any technology enthusiast. It's mind-expanding.",1
Dmitry,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Insanely great,"I want to start off by saying that this book is an absolute joy to read, although there is very little chance that it will give you any practical knowledge that you will be able to apply in your day-to-day endeavors. You will have a lot of fun though if you just want a good technical read that doesn't make your head explode because of all the complexity it imposes on you.

The book is basically about how computers work and it's written in a very logical way. The author starts out with the most basic electrical circuit composed of a battery, a switch and a lightbulb and explains how it works. Next, he adds an electro magnet to it thus introducing us to relays. After that, he proceeds to combine those elements in such ways that we get an adding machine, a counter, selectors etc. Next, we build a processor and memory for it, and this is basically a computer. Of course there's plenty of supporting material. You'll very rarely have a moment of ""Wait, I don't get that"", and this is a big plus. The book does unfortunately get a little messy in its final chapters, the author kinda skims through some advanced subjects pretty quickly (like sound, images, etc). All in all, this book reads as an interesting story, not as your standard dry and boring textbook.

Don't pick this book up if you're strongly inclined towards humanitarian sciences and absolutely hate math, physics and logic, you'll drop it as soon the author introduces numerical systems other than decimal, and this is what the book uses a lot in subsequent pages. For all others, get this book and satisfy that geek inside you.",2
Anthony,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,A good book for computer science introduction,"Definitely a good book on the history of computer and also how each part of computer evolved during the past several decades.

max,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,I'm glad to say this is one of the best books ...,"As a recent graduate working in the IT world, I'm glad to say this is one of the best books I've read on Computer Science. I've never read a CS book that I couldn't put down like this one! Although this book is nearly fifteen years old, the concepts remain the same as the root of all programming and computer technology. I've taken many programming, mathematical logic, and hardware courses during my education and wish I had read this book much earlier! It simply describes the fundamentals of computer, while taking you on a journey through the history of computers. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in CS or learning about the technology that we use on a daily basis.",1
J. Rosen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,One of my favorite computer books of all-time!,"I have been working in computer software for over 40 years and I have read many books on computers. A colleague of mine had this book and at a glance I was intrigued so I decided to order it for myself. I was not disappointed. This is one of the most interesting books on computers that I have ever read. It is neither software nor hardware book, and as author Charles Petzold says, the book doesn't explain how computers work in the way you might expect. What he does is create an historical perspective on how the inner workings of a computer were built up from the earliest kinds of switching capabilities (starting with concepts as simple as the telegraph relay). By the time you get halfway through the book you realize that the remarkable capabilities of a computer are indeed nothing but very basic operations (add, subtract, compare, branch) and that a modern machine could theoretically be built from components that existed over 100 years ago (although the resulting machine would be slow and very large, but it would do all the same work that modern microprocessor does today). The rest of the book takes you much more rapidly through the evolution from the early switch/vacuum tube days to more complex large-scale integrated circuitry, but continuing to remind you that the only novel thing that is going on is the miniaturization, performance improvements and power consumption benefits. For the most part, computers (at the base level) are just as ""dumb"" as they would have been 100 years ago (if they had existed), just smaller and faster and requiring less electricity to work. In the end, it is the software that createsthe real ""magic"". A great book for novice and expert alike.",1
Lawrence Fitzgerald,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,This book is a keeper!,"This book was nothing short of amazing! Reading this book from beginning to end gave me an understanding of modern computer technology that I did not have before.

The author starts off with childhood friends talking via the old the flashlight method; then goes on to talk about math, music, photography barcodes and many other topics that seem completely unrelated--but are connected by the same underlying math and number systems.

This book was very interesting and thorough. It is a must read for anyone who is determined to work in the IT industry.",1
BigTimeGames,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,I just re-read the classic and loved it again,"I was lucky to pick up a copy before it apparently went out of press in printed form. Its really a great way to explore how computers really work -- down to the bits and gates behind a real computer.

Personally I thought the last 2 chapters were not really needed or just went blazing fast thru the recent 25 years, but I understand the authors intent of providing context to how fast things have changed since the original computers.

I wish everyone read this book and learned a little more about how architectures work. I learned this same stuff in school in digital design and computer architecture, but this book is such a great refresher on it all. While I was never sure if this was a well received book (seems so by the ratings) -- Kudos to the author and Kindle for having this still available for people!",1
falmvtex,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,amazing...great for computer hobbyist,"I purchased this as an enthusiast for technology, but someone who has never taken a computer science course (or MOOC ;)

Why did I buy it? I liked the title...so really had no idea what to expect.

The author takes you on amazing journey, starting with the most basic forms of communication (morse code, telegraph) and math (logic and 1's and 0's) until before you know it, he's outlining how a motherboard works and the basic components of processing, RAM, CPU, etc....

It is really fun because he uses the same analogies throughout which help maintain a thread of familiarity as you delve into more sophisticated information.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Interesting book for some who actually DOES want to know how the watch is made.,"This is an interesting book. As I read it, I found myself telling my daughters about parts of it. Yes, book about programming and how computers works to a larger degree, but it also tells a bit of a story about how the use of codes (or unusual application of codes) developed over the years in a variety of interesting examples. It then nicely rolls into how memory (in computers) work and how gate arrays work, etc. Won't be everyone's cup of tea but I really liked it.",1
Fernando B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,The most incredible experience I've had with a tech book in a long time.,"You see tons of publications explaining how CPUs work (or the von Neumann architecture, in fact) that discuss about logic gates, buses, etc, but this is the first one (for the general public) I've ever saw that went that deep into the very basics on what a logic gate in fact is, how clock signal works with them, how instruction fetching is done, to name a few. The use of relay arrangements to explain all those things was just incredible. While reading, you kind of get a will to go to a hardware shop and buy a bunch of relays just to build a simple accumulator with one of the oldest electronic devices available, just because this book demonstrates how this is possible.",2
jBusch,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Good stuff is towards the end,"When I first got this book it was required reading for an entry level computer science course, we learned everything that this book talks about but I didn't quite get ""why"" we were being taught all these things. I made it about half-way through the book and felt it was pretty silly and boring. It was talking about logic gates and using them to buy a cat from the pet store, neutered, female, gray, and all this other stuff that in my mind had nothing to do with computers.

It wasn't until about a year later I picked up this book again and began reading more and more computer science and programming related books. Once I started reading this again I wanted to find out what happens towards the end. And realize why I was taught different number systems and logic gates back in that entry level course. It wasn't until about chapter 17 where I realized what all of it had been leading up to and it was pretty awesome. The following chapters were quite interesting but I felt too short. It felt like all the good stuff was in the last 100 pages or so.

I think Petzold wrote this book so that anyone could understand code and how computers work. So if you're already a computer science person the early stuff might seem a bit boring and repetitive, but once you get to the end it will all make sense. I'm glad I did go back and read it again, because the first time through I never got that far. I think it was mainly because I was focused on passing all my classes and this book was more of an extension of the class and not a requirement to read it. I'd recommend this book to anyone vaguely interested in how computers work, or anyone in the computer science or programming fields. It's really useful to understand exactly what's going on when you are programming. And this book essentially explains how you could build your own computer and know exactly how it works.",2
R. Pokkyarath,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,a wonderful introduction to computers,"This book has a special place in my heart. I started my career working for one of the big box software service companies and the work I was exposed to was of a pretty boring nature i.e. repetitive work with no room for any thought; the focus was on doing things mechanically without understanding what the thing is all about. Moreover, my educational background was mechanical/industrial engg and hence I entered the field without knowing much about the field of computing. So that was my introduction to the field of computing and the combination of these factors was disastrous; soon I lost my interest in the field and I was terribly depressed. Later on I moved to other functional areas (product mgnt, project mgnt, prod mktng etc) thinking that my salvation would be there since I thought I would be able to get a broader view of the problem we are trying to solve (as opposed what I was exposed in the engineering side). After making a few trips along that route I realized my salvation is not going to come from that side either. Along the way I tried to figure it out myself and after going through a lot of introductory books (with explanations in a piecemeal manner which I found to be unsatisfactory) I somehow stumbled on this book...and this is the book that kindled my interest. I have since then read numerous books on computing that I found to be extremely interesting, but without the spark provided by this book I would still be in the dark.

The nice thing about this book is the approach of moving forward in time from 1850's or so onwards to the end of 20th century, starting from simpler technologies and progressively moving to complicated ones. The author starts with an explanation about morse code, braille system, telegraphs (and even a primer on electricity), number system, boolean logic before moving onto to logic gates, half adders, full adders, doing subtraction, edge triggered flip flops and more. All the components and ideas that form part of the hierarchical abstraction of the machine is explained in minute details. I remember spending a lot of time thinking up many circuits using the concept of logic gates described here. The chapters on memory, automation and microprocessors is simply brilliant and the detailed sketches of the varying states of these components makes it very easy to comprehend. Towards the end of the book the author seem to increase the pace a bit and the final chapters such as operating system and graphical revolution does not seem to have the same kind of magic that the middle ones had. I suspect the author was wary of making the book too huge and thereby losing the interest of the reader.

This book is targeted at someone who truly wants to have an understanding of computers, i.e. if you believe that software, hardware, processors, network, high level, low level, etc etc cannot be looked upon as isolated silos, then this book is for you.",3
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,A carefully crafted book on the basics of computer hardware and software,"This is an incredible book.

Even though I'm a CS professional, this book has cast light on many areas that seemed full of ""magic"" to me. The author doesn't try to cover a lot of ground quickly. Instead, he takes the time to carefully explain each topic before moving to the next. Explained in very simple terms and gradually increasing in complexity, this book seems to target a wide audience, from the layman to the professional. It is hard to think how any interested person can not benefit from this book.

My favorite part is when the author ""builds"" a CPU step-by-step with the building blocks he had previously explained, culminating in the creation of a rudimentary assembly language. This is in stark contrast to other hardware books, which tend to take a top-down approach. Brilliant.

In addition, the book is a very satisfying read. Written in an informal tone, it embarks in a technical and historical journey that is very engaging and full of WOW moments.

If I had to recommend only one book in computer science, this would be it. I wish I had read this book years ago.",1
S. M. Mitchell,4.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Approachable and Thorough Introduction to Computer Science,"This book was written for a broad audience, contains elements of the history of the digital computer, and explains how a computer works from the transistor level up to graphic output. It is an interesting and relatively easy read up to the chapter explaining how memory works. The remaining chapters are manageable but require much more time to process. This would be the perfect book for an intro to computer science class, as there are multiple opportunities for the instructor to compose exercises that would help solidify concepts for students.",1
W. Cheung,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Now (I think) I know how a computer works,"Wow. Before I read this book, I already knew about logic gates, but I did not know (1) how electric and electonic devices can in the real world perform the function of logic gates and (2) how by arranging logic gates wisely one can perform addition and subtraction and (3) more complicated mathematical operations can be performed by doing ""a lot of"" additions and subtractions. Now I (kind of) know.

All these are gratifying.

Starting from Chapter 17, however, the speed and depth of the book changes gear quite a bit (at least to me). From that chapter onward, it is about the relatively detailed working of a modern computer - e.g. how integrated circuits (chips) work, what microprocessors are, etc. In Chapter 18, for instance, the author answered the question in the preface: ""why can't you run Macintosh programs under Windows?"". It is quite rewarding to understand why.

Different readers will have different views towards this book. By profession I am a physician and have no experience in serious computing, so I myself find Chapters 21 and 22 particularly difficult. But overall I think I have learned a lot from this book. Five stars.",3
Eric Daza,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Know your ROOTS,I recommend this book to whomever is interested on how programming language ever came to be. You will not learn the a specific language (well maybe binary and a little bit of morse code) but yet you will understand how it all started and why. When it came to logic (Digital Logic) it helped me out in my computer architecture classes at school. This book will encourage you to think and ask why is this that way and not the other. Illustrations are nice and simple when they are needed and nothing overly confusing at all. Like I said it does not teach you programming but teaches you why we have programming.,1
N.M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Three words A. Maze. Ing.,"This book was recommended to me by Steve Gibson in the Security Now! podcast during listener feedback episode 242 ([...]). This book is absolutly great. Petzold Starts with the bare basics of binary code explained with everyday examples such as Morse code and Braille, then goes into electricity, then Boolean logic, and slowly takes you into Logic gates and beyond. The book is easy to follow with lots of diagrams that are easy to understand. Anyone with a high school education who has taken Algebra and physical science (and passed)should be able to follow along. Be warned, you may have to read some sections twice, some of the information is pretty heavy, but don't get discouraged. It is a little dated, the book was printed in 1999, so some of the examples are a little old (like movies and music on magnetic tape, 32 Megs of ram on a computer) but the principles remain the same. This book is an excellent introduction into the inner workings of a computer and is a must read for anyone going into computer science, computer programing, or IT as it give the underlying fundamentals to understanding how these machines work in a world that takes them for granted.",2
Lance C. Hibbeler,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,explanation of computers for the laymen,"This book is quite possibly the best explanation of how computers work from a bottom-up perspective I have ever come across. Petzold takes us on a journey in short, easy-to-read, and occasionally humorous chapters, staring from two young children passing messages to each other after bed time with flashlights, all the way up though circuitry, machine language, memory, and so on. I also enjoyed the historical aspect of Petzold's presentation. He gives names, dates, and sometimes faces. Personally, I find it amazing that we humans have come so far in so short a time period with all our technologies.

Petzold requires no in-depth knowledge of computers from his readers- he gradually builds up on concepts that are always tied back to everyday occurrences in your life. Let's take the discussion of Morse code as a talking point: Sure, you could flash a light bulb once for A, twice for B, three times for C, and so on, but your fingers would fall off after a few words. Instead, lets agree to vary the length of time the light is on, and combine different sequences of light blinks to correspond to different letters, which is much easier on the fingers, because we make commonly used letters easier to send. From there, we get into telegraphs, and oh by the way, that is essentially the same way computers send data. This is typical of what Petzold does all throughout the book: start with what most people would call a reasonable solution to a problem, expose its flaws, then show the more thought-out solution, and then fill in the gaps to tie it back to modern digital computers.

The book is ten years old now, but is still very relevant...which I find astounding, given how fast anything to do with computers changes these days. Petzold barely skims the surface of programming, so if you are looking for a book strictly on coding, search elsewhere (try the more software-oriented explanation of computer workings Write Great Code: Volume 1: Understanding the Machine). The last few chapters do seem to be a hurried conclusion, but I would attribute this more to the fact that now that we know how computers work, what we can do with them is an infinitely broad category, so only a summary discussion is reasonable.

Whether you are a computer scientist or not, I think you will benefit from this gem of a book- if you are not, then enjoy learning how computers really work. If you are an established computer scientist, you've probably seen everything in the book before, but it still warrants your time because of the clear analogies that are used throughout the book. I know I have had enough people ask me ""how does (insert something about computers) work?"", and I haven't been able to clearly explain the concepts- now I have some good analogies to use, as well as a book to heartily recommend.",1
A. Reed,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,I've been looking for a book like this for a decade,"A talented computer programmer I crossed paths with said, ""My dad is an electrical engineer, but I never really understood electricity. After I read this book, I called him and said, 'Dad, I finally understand what you've been saying about electricity all these years.' ""
Intrigued, I bought this book for myself and for my teenage son, and halfway through the first chapter I knew it was the book I've been looking for for more than a decade. Actually, it is two in one. All the promotional material about the book tells how it explains computers and technology; it does that beautifully, creatively. But more than that, it explains what my 13-year-old engineer-in-the-making son calls the ""invisible magic,"" which is electricity.
I am an editor, and I would go on record as saying this is one of the best written, most inventively written books that I have ever come across. The night I gave it to my son (at 10 p.m.), he began devouring it. At 8 a.m. the next morning, he was already on Chapter 3, and he took it to school with him.
I give my thanks to the author for going to the effort to write the book and get it published.",2
Rudy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Excellent Book To Understand Computers at the Basic Level,"I am a computer programmer by trade and sincerely wish I had this book 7 years back when I started formal education. During my 4+ years in the higher education system, and even after, I and my classmates (later colleagues) were taught how to program computers (in various languages) and many of the higher level ideas in programming (Data Structures, Algorithms, Program Structure, Etcetera, Etcetera, Etcetera) but we never really learned how the computers worked inside. Even to many trained programmers, or at least me:), these beige boxes can be something of a magical black box which we don't really understand at a fundamental beyond the point of it processing the instructions we give it in our chosen programming language. In school I recieved perhaps one single semester course that attempted to teach how these things worked inside, yet that course still skimmed on the inner workings, the teacher instead spent his time on how monitors drew pixels on the screen and how laser printers worked.....

Looking back on it, I would blame the ignorance of the inner workings of computers that some programmers have on the decline of having to learn Assembly language (starting in the early nineties?), the lowest level programming language sans actual Machine Code, where one would be forced to deal with the raw inner workings of a computer naturally. I myself hope to learn it one day after reading this book :D Instead, I was taught the C programming language and what we learned in school became only more abstract in regards to the actual hardware...

This is where this wonderful book came into play. Since I recieved it half-a-year ago, it must have been read/devoured by me a dozen times or more - it goes from teaching the make-up of various codes (morse, braille, etcetera) to showing how some simple to understand concepts can be combined until a working computer, calculator, etcetera, can be built....... it gives one a great foundation for learning what Computer Science is all about or gives a newer-generation Programmer, like me, much needed knowledge on how that beige box basically works, on a hardware level!

The best thing is that those computer analogies can be finally thrown out the window - we all heard them before - like how ""ram is like a table, or workspace. The bigger it is, the more things you can have ready and available at one time. The hard drive is like your drawers and cabinets. You can store more stuff there, but to use it, you have to take it out first and put it either on the table (RAM) or hold it in your hand (cache)."" Petzold also uses analogies when he introdues topics but quickly moves beyond them, giving his audiences real understanding of the subject - which is very welcoming since analogies tend to explain function well but break down quickly when one is determined to learn more about a topic.

It is probably one of the few computer books on my shelf that can't get outdated and that's good, because it still will be there in 20 years.",16

He makes no assumptions that the reader may already know something, but explains everything in details and in a very easy to understand way even for non technical people. In a way this is the book that I have been looking for for a long long time. As a programmer and a non CS graduate, this book has enabled me to understand in a great detail how a computer works and why it does some things a certain way.

The book is also very readable. Unlike most technical books, you can just sit down and read it, so you definitely don't have to slog through it.

Most of the explanations are very clear and, since the book starts from the very basic and builds up, it's very easy to understand. I think a 12 year old who's passionate about computers would probably feel comfortable with the book.",1

His response was a suggestion that I read Microsoft Press' book, ""Code"". His recommendation couldn't have been more accurate; this book fully answered my question.

The author, Charles Petzold, takes a progressive approach and conveys the interesting logic behind the processes that make our computer systems run. If you're an amateur computer enthusiast, like me, be prepared to spend some time wrapping your head around the material. However, the exercise will be well worth it. I highly recommend taking notes while reading the text. Note taking helped me organize my thoughts and commit what I had read to memory. I hope that you enjoy this text as much as I did; happy reading!",1
Marcos Szydlo,4.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Fun and instructive book on the basics of computing,This is a fun and well written overview of the basic architecture of computers and for the most part is done in a way that is easy for a lay person to follow. I have enjoyed reading this as well as other books written by this author.,1
James Adams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,A must-read for any computer professional,"This book is an instant classic. The material covered is similar to what you would see in a basic Discrete Mathematics course, with some electrical engineering and computer org & design thrown in. However, unlike those courses (which can be dry and boring at times) the author makes the material in this book extremely interesting and entertaining to read. The book is divided into short chapters which allowed me to read in short bursts when I had a few free minutes. The author leads the reader down a calculated path, resulting in a compelling journey that is brought to a conclusion. If you are a Software Engineer (as I am) or any type of computer professional, you MUST read this book if you take your craft seriously.",1

Meredith Rice,4.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,"If you can get through it, you'll learn a lot",I did learn a lot from this book but it was not an easy read.

James B. Delong,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Best Book I've Read This Year,"I think that this is the best book that I have read all year. In some sense this is the book that I have been looking for for twenty-five years--the book that will enable me to understand how a computer does what it does. And--given the centrality of computers in our age--it has been a long wait. But now it is over. Charles Petzold (1999), Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software does a much better job than anything else I have ever seen in explaining computers--what they really are, and how they really work.
Have you ever wondered just how your computers really work? I mean, really, really work. Not as in ""an electrical signal from memory tells the processor the number to be added,"" but what the electrical signal is, and how it accomplishes the magic of switching on the circuits that add while switching off the other circuits that would do other things with the number. I have. I have wondered this a lot over the past decades.
Yet somehow over the past several decades my hunger for an explanation has never been properly met. I have listened to people explain how two switches wired in series are an ""AND""--only if both switches are closed will the lightbulb light. I have listened to people explain how IP is a packet-based communications protocol and TCP is a connection-based protocol yet the connection-based protocal can ride on top of the packet-based protocol. Somehow these explanations did not satisfy. One seemed like answering ""how does a car work?"" by telling how in the presence of oxygen carbon-hydrogen bonds are broken and carbon dioxide and water are created. The other seemed like anwering ""how does a car work"" by telling how if you step on the accelerator the car moves forward.
Charles Petzold is different. He has hit the sweet spot exactly. Enough detail to satisfy anyone. Yet the detail is quickly built up as he ascends to higher and higher levels of explanation. It remains satisfying, but it also hangs together in a big picture.
In fact, my only complaint is that the book isn't long enough. It is mostly a hardware book (unless you want to count Morse Code and the interpretation of flashing light bulbs as ""software."" By my count there are twenty chapters on hardware, and five on software. In my view only five chapters on software--one on ASCII, one on operating systems, one on floating-point arithmetic, one on high-level languages, and one on GUIs--is about ten too few. (Moreover, at one key place in his explanation (but only one) he waves his hands. He argues that it is possible to use the operation codes stored in memory to control which circuits in the processor are active. But he doesn't show how it is done.)
Charles Petzold's explanatory strategy is to start with the telegraph: with how opening and closing a switch can send an electrical signal down a wire. And he wants to build up, step by step, from that point to end with our modern computers. At the end he hopes that the reader can look back--from the graphical user interface to the high-level language software constructions that generate it, from the high-level language software constructions to the machine-language code that underlies it, from the machine-language code to the electrical signals that load, store, and add bits into the computer's processor and into the computer's memory.
But it doesn't stop there. It goes further down into how to construct an accumulator or a memory bank from logic gates. And then it goes down to how to build logic gates--either out of transistors or telegraph relays. And then deeper down, into how the electrons actually move through a transistor or through a relay and a wire.
And at the end I could look back and say, yes, I understand how this machine works in a way that I didn't understand it before. Before I understood electricity and maybe an AND gate, and I understood high level languages. But the whole vast intermediate realm was fuzzy. Now it is much clearer. I can go from the loop back to the conditional jump back to the way that what is stored in memory is fed into the processor back to the circuits that set the program counter back to the logic gates, and finally back to the doped silicon that makes up the circuit.
So I recommend this book to everyone. It is a true joy to read. And I at least could feel my mind expanding as I read it.",374
J. Schowalter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Had to get it again,"I bought this copy because I had loaned a previous version out. I never got that version back. While this book doesn't have any projects in it, I was provoked implement some of the discoveries discussed on my own. I was so involved with the development over time that I thought I was there and doing some of the experiments along side the original developers.

This is a great book and it will help one understand how simple processes can be built upon each other to create a complicated computing machine like the desktop PCs we now use daily.",1

Boris S,5.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,"Great, but it's not ALL for a ""Novice""","The book starts out very solid, describing all the building blocks of a computer. The beginning is the best book I've seen so far describings everything from the binary system to electrical circuits, to gates to simple calculators, to memory, to a complete machine with a ""control panel"". But after that, the book started getting a LOT more broad (not necessarily a bad thing). It seems almost as if Petzold wanted to tell you everything about the world of computers, but couldn't fit it in a book such as this; so he dabbed a little here and there of a few terms, history, etc... (allowing you the option to look up anything you wanted if you had the interest).
My oppinion is that the book is _great_ up to about the middle of the book, after which he just condenced all the rest of the information which would otherwise takes thousands of pages to describe in as much details as he described how to build a physical logic machine... I think that if someone isn't a ""techie"" or isn't in the computer field, they may have some hard time understanding a few minor points... but overall, this is a GREAT book.. one of a kind.
Greatly recommended for everyone's library... I can honestly say, I always told people ""a computer is nothing more than zero's and one's""... but until I read this book, I couldn't BUILD one... now I can (given time! :).
P.S. This book is perfect for those who didn't necessarily go to college and learned everything on their own... it covers some CS, CE, and EE. Those who went to college with either of those majors probably learned the greatest part of this book... but it's a great review.",37

T. B. Gausen,4.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,actually an introduction to electromechanics,"This book gives a bottom-up, in depth explanation of how an electromechanical computer might work. It explains what a relay is and how it can be used to implement the logic circuitry of a digital computer. Beginning with AND and OR gates, it ends with a Turing complete computer. Beautiful!

The remaining two thirds of the book I was just skimming through. From countless other books I already know about number bases and ASCII, for instance.

In the last chapters the author tries to cram just about everything else that could be mentioned about computers. This leads to a few errors (like ""Unicode is 16 bits"", a widely held misconception) [edit: I since discovered that this was actually true back in the early 90's when this book was written. Sorry, Mr. Petzold!] and several explanations way too short to convey significant content. On two pages (376 and 377) Petzold covers compression, (lossy and reversible), something called ""metafiles"" (dunno what that is), OCR, digitized sound and CDs, microphones, ADCs, DACs...

Instead if this, I would have liked the gory details on how vacuum tubes, transistors and integrated chips actually work. What exactly in the CPU in my laptop does the same work as the relays in the early chapters? How can current from one circuit block or amplify current from another?

I still don't know how my computer works, but after reading this book, at least I know how an electromechanical computer might work.",3

At about chapter 10, when logic gates are introduced, I felt I was reading a text book, without the practice problems or variety of examples. The author's ability to write cohesive understandable statements diminishes at this point in the book. Assumptions begin to be made about circuit diagrams, and it is extremely easy to become lost. The book is not easy to read at all post chapter 10ish, and this why EE and CE's get paid 100k+ per year. Code has great merit, but the reality is the subject matter is tough to understand. Those of you who give this book 5 stars claiming they were completely enlightened are full of it. Just because you took the time to read the words doesn't mean you understood what they said.

Parts of its functioning are explained in the popular press, but you almost never get the whole picture: to many people (even highly educated people) the functioning of a computer must be something akin to magic. Petzold's book tries to remedy this by trying to explain how the computer works from the bottom up. The book is fascinating stuff, and is easy to follow at first. He easily explains concepts such as the binary code, logical gates, switches, the merging of boolean algebra to electrical engineering (this was first considered in a master theses by Claude Shannon, and its probably the great breakthrough that led to modern computing), the roles of transistors, microprocessors, etc. Inevitably, the complexity rises in the later chapters, and if you are not a physicist or an electrical engineer, you would be unable to understand everything.

In the first 10 pages I have read the author says: ""Morse code is said to be a binary code."" but Morse Code is not binary, it 'can be represented' by binary. This is a very important information.

Also in the beginning of the book the author says 2 friends try to communicate with just flashing the light the number of times where the character is found in the Alphabet. Like one friend will flash the light 1 time and wait to say 'A' and flash it 3 times and wait to say 'C'. Now THIS IS BINARY. You either 'flash' or 'do not flash'. 1101110means BC ,where I represented this by Binary, but for Morse Code I will need 'space' like: 10 111 (or whatever).",3

L. W. Noronha,3.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,A laudable effort. But the book is an enigma.,"A commendable effort. But I couldn't tell if Petzold set out to teach an introductory computing course to the non-technical reader or if he meant to include everbody. In either case, he will probably disappoint both camps. He is best when he introduces a topic with fascinating insights. But then he cannot resist giving computing lectures that are best left to a text book. A discussion of edge-triggered D-type flip flops and timing diagrams don't belong in a popular book.
In the chapter on ""Two Classic Microprocessors"" I was hoping for a comparison of the Intel and Motorola architectures and how Motorola lost to Intel in the marketplace despite having a more elegant architecture. Instead, we get a boring treatise of the two instruction sets and sentences like ""The 6800 doesn't have a Parity flag like the 8080, but it does have ... an Overflow flag"". He might have been forgiven if he was using it to make the CISC vs. RISC case. Instead RISC gets only a cursory mention.

unifex,1.0 out of 5 stars,Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,WARNING: For hardcore geeks only!!!,"I am the manager of a computer store and a graphic/web designer and as such I use and troubleshoot computers every day and know rather a lot about them.

This book looked interesting because on the jacket it uses phrases like, ""illuminating narrative"" and ""eminently comprehensible"" and ""no matter what your level of technical savvy"".

In reality though after the 1st few chapters the book falls into an absolute quagmire of circuit diagrams and boolean logic tables and RAM address schemes and loses all sense of narrative or comprehensibility.

Unless you are really into math and/or are a programmer I would highly recommend AVOIDING THIS BOOK.

I am not a stupid person nor unfamiliar with computers but this was wayyyy beyond where I wanted to go with this. And my guess is that it's way beyond for most other folks as well.

An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) arose from the perceived need for a broader and less technical treatment of these topics.""

ISL is neither as comprehensive nor as in-depth as ESL. It is, however, an excellent introduction to Learning due to the ability of the authors to strike a perfect balance between theory and practice. Theory is there to aim the reader as to understand the purpose and the ""R Labs"" at the end of each chapter are as valuable (or perhaps even more) than the end-of-chapter exercises.

ISL is an excellent choice for a two-semester advanced undergraduate (or early graduate) course, practitioners trained in classical statistics who want to enter the Learning space, and seasoned Machine Learners. It is especially helpful for getting the fundamentals down without being bogged down in heavy mathematical theory, a great way to kick-off corporate Learning units, or as an aid to help statisticians and learners communicate better.

A needed and welcome addition to the Learning literature, authored by some of the most well respected names in industry and academia. A classic in the making. Recommended unreservedly.

UPDATE (12/17/2013): Two of the authors (Hastie & Tibshirani) are offering a 10-week free online course (StatLearning: Statistical Learning) based on this book found at Stanford University's Web site (Starting Jan. 21, 2014). They also say that ""As of January 5, 2014, the pdf for this book will be available for free, with the consent of the publisher, on the book website."" Amazing opportunity! Enjoy!

UPDATE (04/03/2014): I took the course above and found it very helpful and insightful. You don't need the course to understand the book. If anything, the course videos are less detailed than the book. It is certainly nice, though, to see the actual authors explain the material. Also, the interviews by Efron and Friedman were a nice touch. The course will be offered again in the future.",112
Megatron,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics),Recommended reading for graduate programs with computational data analysis,"ISLR is possibly the best book I've ever encountered on the subject of statistical learning. Throughout my studies, I spent countless days reading more complicated theoretical texts, but few have stuck, and I've never fully understood how to translate the theory to code (specifically, in R). This is probably because my background in statistics was limited to a single prerequisite undergraduate course. I have been waiting a decade to find a book like this, containing basic theory (with plenty of figures), some math, code snippets and reproducible examples. If you are completing a graduate degree in any field where data is collected en masse, I *strongly* recommend this book. I think graduate advisors should make it required reading in the first year of graduate school for students who will be performing computational data analysis.

ISLR teaches basic regression techniques for prediction and classification and formally explains sampling methods (cross-validation, bootstrapping). The figures are great and the code examples make it very easy to apply the lessons in your own studies. This book formalizes what took me years to learn by diffusion watching seminars and reading papers and blogs. 5 stars!

Bear in mind that this book is not a solid introduction to the R programming language. To learn R, study online courses, the ""swirl"" package. Once you've mastered the basics, look for the book ""Advanced R"".",4
Joseph Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics),cover all of your bases,"If you want to build a comprehensive machine learning library, this would be the first book to purchase. While it does cover all of the basics, it is not watered down by any means. (I had the same fear as BK Reader) I found the following to be especially helpful;

1. Straight talk - These experts come right and say which methods work best under which circumstances. While there are many fancy algorithms covered in the book, they highlight the advantages of the simpler ones.
2. Emphasis on subjects that are not heavily addressed in most ML books - They thoroughly cover the challenges of high-dimensionality, data cleaning, and standardization. They do not limit their attention to these subjects to one chapter. They bring them up continually throughout the book.
3. Expertise - Dr. Hastie and Dr. Tibshirani are two of the thought leaders in statistical learning. You can be assured that you are learning from the best.
4. Many levels of depth - While the book does cover the basics, it is not watered down by any means. (I had the same worry as BK Reader) There is a great deal for any student of statistics; beginner or advanced.
5. R code - You are given enough code and examples to gain confidence in your ability to independently perform excellent analysis and modeling.
6. The concepts are just plain exciting! - You will feel an excitement as you discover and re-discover the algorithms they present.

The book is a standard work along with Elements of Statistical Learning and Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (the Bayesian approach). If you enjoy the book, you may also want to consider Applied Predictive Modeling. It has the same style and approach.",45
Josh Davis,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics),"Future Classic, hopefully?","This book was used in my graduate level Machine Learning class (with certain readings/problems from the authors other more challenging book, The Elements of Statistical Learning).

I loved the class and loved the book. I thought the applications with R made it far more accessible and made it easier to learn. While I totally love the theoretical underpinnings, sometimes they aren't the best to learn right away and applying the ideas make it easier to grasp.

Rob Tibs & Trevor Hastie also had an online course offered through Stanford's EdX that ran the same time I was taking the course. It had videos of Trevor and Rob explaining the concepts in the order they were presented in the book. The course also included exercises and quizzes. The best part of the online course was that Rob & Trevor were absolutely hilarious. I loved their commentary and their personalities clashed in the most humorous way possible; it is very easy to see that they love what they do and love each other's company.

I'd totally recommend this book. Keep an eye out for the next offering on Stanford's online course web page; it makes it a lot more enjoyable.",24
Nom de Plume,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics),I can't imagine it being any better!,"This book is a terrific introduction to statistical (machine) learning. I purchased this book as preparation for graduate school where we would be studying statistical/machine learning and this book has helped me to be very confident in my understanding of the algorithms/math and concepts behind each of the methods. If you aren't well skilled in R, the authors do offer a brief introduction to the language and they do explain everything very well. However, I would recommend 'R in Action' before or alongside this book to help you get you started.

The authors have done an outstanding job of taking complex topics and making them very understandable and quite frankly enjoyable. It also gives end of chapter exercises to practice all concepts that are covered. As others have stated, you can take the course for the book online. If you don't want to wait until the next course on the Stanford website opens up you can also use the link below for access to the youtube videos of the course lectures/powerpoints.

HOWEVER, if you do best with hard copy books, this is thorough and highly readable by less technical audiences needing an introduction to R.. As stated in the introduction, the book is intended to be a companion to the more mathematically rigorous book--The Elements of Statistical Learning, also available for free--by the same authors.

Steve,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics),Excellent Introduction to Statistical Learning,"An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) provides a fantastic introduction to the field. The book introduces the reader to most of the common machine learning methods (neural networks being a notable exception) using applied examples and graphics, and explains how the methods relate to one another. I recommend ISL as a precursor to The Elements of Statistical Learning, which provides a level of depth greater than many people need. ISL is an introduction to statistical learning, not an introduction to statistics. A basic knowledgeable of statistics/probability is essential to follow the text of the book, but may not be enough to understand all of the equations without difficulty. Readers with a heavy statistical background, however, will find the book to be a relatively easy read.",1

If you do not have a good math background and fundamentals in Statistics, it may be difficult for you to follow 100%, but you will still get to learn so much about Statistical Learning. I really like the following in this book:

1. This book is focused on the statistical learning part, with concepts, applications and R code
2. Chapters are very well organized with increasing order of difficulty
3. Its almost like reading a story. Each figure and equation are weaved into the story
4. R examples were a breeze. I had no knowledge of R language but I did not have any problems

I also enjoy rereading this book every time. :-)",2
Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics),A Gold Mine,"When I come across a book that shapes the way I think in a good way, I call it a gold mine.
I don't think I could have accomplished as much without the help of this book. I was working with miRNA data, and I read through the chapters I needed to understand the classification models I wanted to work with.
The R code examples are very accessible and very useful. It probably saved me a lot of Google searches and headaches.
The authors of this book are extremely intelligent and pragmatic, and the writing is accessible to anyone. I never took any statistics classes. While I found it helpful (and I would say necessary) to learn at least some Stat 101 material to give intuition to the concepts in this book, the material is otherwise self contained.
The PDF is free online, and I prefer PDF format, but I loved the book so much that I bought the Kindle version off of Amazon to support the authors.

For statistical analysis and, as the title suggests, statistical learning, this is hands down the best material I have encountered in any medium.

First, the book is rigorous. Even if the material is not as comprehensive as the canonical Elements of Statistical Learning, which is almost unapproachable for a novice, the material here is by no means dumbed down. You should be comfortable with mathematical thinking and at least have been exposed to statistics, although calculus and linear algebra are mostly absent. And you should expect to spend time thinking about the content, which the text makes very rewarding.

Second, the authors present the material brilliantly. Explanations of difficult concepts are lucid, and the chapters progress in a way that just makes sense. Yes you will spend time thinking about the material -- hopefully you want to! -- AND yes, the authors will help you along the way.

ISLR is written for a less mathematically savvy audience (i.e., someone like me) and contains R labs at the end of each chapter.

This textbook is different. It is distinctly applied and very well explained using plain English. There is sufficient theoretical material here and the authors occasionally point the reader to the more rigorous Elements of Statistical Learning for deeper theoretical understanding of the concepts. The R programming labs at the end of each chapter successfully reinforce the concepts in the chapter readings. With the trend towards online learning, this book has found the right balance of sufficiently technical, skills-based learning and great explanations to fill the gap when lectures are not available.

S. Austin,3.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,"Groundbreaking, back in the day","When I first learned about this book I found it an exciting way to codify and categorize various OO techniques - I wouldn't say it introduced any new design/implementation strategies, but it gave us all a common terminology for what we'd been doing all these years. Since then, I suppose the terminology has largely entered the programming lexicon so it's useful for all OO programmers to be familiar with these concepts and terms.

However, we are way, way overdue for a new edition, one written using C++11/14 or modern Java for the examples. The C++98-based examples really date this book - lines and lines of code to illustrate what you'd do with a bit of STL in modern C++. The patterns themselves are still relevant, but I hope no one is taking the code examples too seriously.",11
William P Ross,5.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,Timeless Programming Classic For The Ages,"Twenty Two years since the book's publication it remains incredibly relevant. In the beginning I was surprised the discussion in 1994 was this high level. The preface and introduction are awesome. For example, there was one discussion about dynamically typed languages versus statically typed lanugages... I was not even aware this was being discussed in 1994.

In certain situations you see how this book changed the way the field of computer science developed. Before the writing of the book the authors originally called the Singleton pattern the Solitaire pattern. They changed it last minute (explained in the Conclusion) from Solitaire to Singleton, and that is a major part of why everybody calls it Singleton today.

Some people may have an issue with the age of book. When you read the introduction, they mention that C++ and Smalltalk are cutting edge programming languages. I know C++ pretty well, but I have never used Smalltalk. What I learned from the book was how Smalltalk was fundamental to creating the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework. In a lot of places the authors point out situations where C++ programmers would implement a pattern one way, and Smalltalk programmers might use the pattern another way.

The book's examples are mostly about text writing programs, windowing, and drawing. These examples fit well for the patterns. You can also see how the current state of programming was much different. Text editors were creating huge innovations back then.

This book requires sophistication as a programmer. It will be a challenging book for pretty much anyone to understand completely. You need to have familiarity with the word choice as well. The authors assume you are well versed in their language. The glossary was pretty good in this book, I would recommend taking a look before you start.

The progression of the book is excellent. There is a lengthy introduction before getting to the patterns. This helps put the entire book in context and prepares you for the challenge to come. Each pattern is unique in subtle ways that the authors explain masterfully.

One hundred years from now this book will still work. The patterns are fundamental to software design itself. I wish most authors were this bold.",2
Blue Chip,5.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,A Classic.,"This book is a classic. I don't know what more can be said to convince a serious computer scientist that this book should be included in ones personal library. If you are obtaining an education in computer science or software engineering you will eventually be introduced to software architecture. Think of design patterns as a sub-class of software architecture. When designing software the same ""patterns"" tend to occur. This book explains the well known patterns which the reader can expand upon in their own projects.

Whether your projects are desktop, mobile, or other, design patterns are an important part of one's knowledge ""toolbox"".",2
Siddhardha,5.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,Must Read,"As others have already noted, this is a seminal work on design patterns and is considered by many software professionals as a must read. It is probably a bit too complex for novices to design patterns in which case they are better off using another resource for starters (e.g.: Head First Design Patterns) and then eventually move on to this book. Head First design patterns was obviously easier to read and understand since the examples are more up to date and material is not as thorough as this book. It took me more than a month and half to read this book carefully from cover to cover. Although a lot of the patterns are discussed in depth from a theoretical level including evaluating trade-offs made with specific implementation choices, the examples in SmallTalk are out of date and not that relevant anymore but that's understandable given the publish date of this book (1994). Like some other books (e.g.: Java Concurrency in Practice), multiple readings are necessary to fully digest the material and that needs to be coupled with either independent practice of the specific implementation choices and/or other resources that have more examples of pattern implementations so as to not only reinforce understanding but also lay a solid foundation for Object Oriented Design. Most senior folks working with Object Oriented Systems typically have this book at their desk as a reference. I found one particular pattern, namely Interpreter, pretty difficult to follow. Other than that the rest of the material is readable. Having some familiarity with UML notation will help but the appendix includes explanation of the notation used in the book, so it is not a stopper if you don't have any exposure in that area. Towards the end of each chapter covering a given pattern, the authors include a section on related patterns which can be extremely helpful. This book also organizes different patterns into creational, structural and behavioral categories and also identifies which ones within a given category can supplement each other and which ones compete against each other. This book is not meant to be a comprehensive resource on design patterns and will have to be supplemented by other books. Highly recommended for anyone working with Object Oriented Systems.",2
Ephraim,5.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,A Classic,"This year (2014) marks the 20th anniversary of this book.

R. Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,CD Edition is Awesome!!,"What you've heard is true: this is the most important book on programming of the last __ years (at least 10, for me maybe of all time).
I wanted to just put a few thoughts in that I didn't see in the other reviews:
1. I read an article one time where John Vlissides (one of the authors) was saying he spoke somewhere and asked how many people had read the book and almost everyone raised their hands, then he asked, who would like to come up and explain how to implement the Composite pattern and suddenly only a couple hands were raised. Though this book is a fount of great ideas, it really will be most useful to you if you become CONVERSATIONAL with EACH of the patterns. That's the whole idea from Alexander anyway so consider it a mandate from on high.
2. One easy way I've used to explain to people what patterns are about is that mere object oriented training leaves people with an idea of how to model things as objects, but so many times I've done reviews of programmers code and they got that far and then as soon as work needed to be done that required more than one class, one of two things happens: they start passing data all over the place (back to the structured world we go), or they start binding their objects into deadly embraces. This book teaches you how to have some 'tricks' in your bag for modeling just such situations. Now, that said, there is some work you will have to do to map it into the newer programming world we're living in, for instance distributed Java makes some services available (like EJBs/container services/messaging) that changes some of the implementation ideas considerably.
3. If you are using Java, you can start to learn patterns and their application to your chosen platform by looking at a vast wealth of work that's already been done. The JDK uses the Observer pattern for its event model. Some of the more advanced frameworks, like BEA's Theory Center, are loaded w/Design Patterns (Chain of Responsibility and Strategy). And many products (Together/J) use patterns in their APIs (Visitor).
Finally, whenever I'm interviewing programmers now I ask them if they know what patterns are, then if they get past that, if they can give me an example of a recent use of a pattern and how it worked. I had a guy a couple of weeks ago looking for 6 figures who told me he'd heard of the book but hadn't gotten around to opening it. Der, that's like a doctor saying 'I've heard milk might not be good for ulcers, but take it because I haven't had time to review the research yet.'

I can see now.what all the hype is about. I have been a developer for almost six years now. I have been using object oriented languages for some time. Despite the experience with the technologies, I didn't have a good working knowlege of how to effectively implement the technology and methodology in my own code. That is, until I read ""Design Patterns"". It has opened my eyes and I understand the concepts of polymorphism and code reuse much more clearly now.

""Design Patterns"" is easy to read, easy to understand and has great code examples that facilitate understanding. It is my opinion that if you haven't read this book and you develop with OOP, you are probably working harder and not smarter. So do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.",1

JavaBarista,5.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,Expand your programming vocabulary...difficult but worth it,"This is a book that you need to chew on for a while and which will take a while to digest once swallowed. It will, however, turn into pure programming muscle as payback for all your effort!
This is an academic treatise (it started out as a Master's thesis) and reads like one. But as you read you'll find yourself identifying with some of the patterns that you've unknowingly used in your own code. And you'll start seeing how you could have used other patterns. And before you know it, your approach to programming has changed and you are able to focus more on the domain-specific issues rather than getting caught up in the need to continuously re-invent the proverbial wheel. And the world looks a little bit brighter.
Any book that does that for you deserves 5 stars regardless of how dry it is.",7

Ash Aragam,4.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,A Software engineer's bible,"A reference manual of best practices in software application design. Best design practices identified and categorized as patterns makes communication and application of the practice easier and more effective. It is not difficult for a somewhat experienced developer to learn these patterns and apply them in day-to-day work, given the content of the book and presentation. Each pattern is discussed with information relating to its applicability, participants, consequences, sample code, known uses, etc.

If you know how traditional mechanical/electrical/civil engineers work, they always have a reference design manual handy. This book serves the same purpose to a good extent.

Beware, the contents are pretty loaded and you may want to dwell on one pattern for some time, few days maybe, before moving onto the next- this book isn't something you can read even in a few sittings. The authors duely recognize this and nicely identify what set of patterns to start with depending on the experience of the reader.

The only complaint I may have of this book is the nature of examples (Singleton pattern example is one). I wish the authors used more business application examples much like a reservation or purchase order system as it would appeal to a larger developer base (IMHO).",3

Mohammad B. Abdulfatah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,Read it� Please!,"I was still a fledgling developer at the time I attempted to first read this book. My initial impression was that it was outdated and dry. But as the months and projects went by, I began to understand the importance of patterns in general and this remarkable text in particular. Indeed, without much experience in the field, one might find this book too theoretical, or even irrelevant to practical work. But one day, you'll find yourself faced with a particularly nasty problem, and all of the sudden a pattern will flash in your mind, and click! The connection is made, and the problem is solved. It was very gratifying for me to experience this feeling over and over again; as I'm sure it would be for any junior developer just getting his feet wet.
Two words of advice come to mind, though: First, please keep in mind that the patterns herein are not the only ones out there; there are many others documented in various other books and articles. Second, be very careful of the Singleton pattern; it is the most overused and abused of the patterns, simply because it is easy to implement. And note that the text says nothing about the destruction of a Singleton, so watch out.
It is my opinion that this book should become mandatory reading for all software developers of all levels, and the patterns within it should be as common a construct as an ""if"" statement or a ""for"" loop. Please, do yourself and your profession a favor and read this book.",10

I used this book in my Undergraduate life and after that I sold it, but Last year I bought it back again.

I also recommend Design Patterns book by Head First along with this. Because it has more Java base implementation on Design patterns.",3
Greg Palen,3.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,"Good book, but not necessarily the best ""first book on patterns"" to read.","This book is a classic in the concept of Pattern-oriented design and overall, it's worth a read in general. That said, having gotten far deeper in the subject over the last year that I've owned this book, I'd say there are much better materials out there for free on the Internet if you take the time to look around. Doug Schmidt is doing some great stuff at Vanderbilt University - go find his stuff online. If you DO want to buy books on pattern-oriented design, I'd go look at the ""POSA"" books (""Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture"" - it's a series and each volume is dedicated to different applications of pattern-oriented design). Doug also has some excellent tutorials on YouTube that I'd go look up.

All that said, I'm in the process of re-reading the book now. I had no prior knowledge of patterns prior to my first read of the book and I really struggled to conceptualize and understand what the book was telling me. Nearly a year later and after several courses on Coursera (a MOOC) that Doug taught, I ""get"" patterns much better and am planning to re-read this book now and have a strong suspicion it'll make much more sense the second time through.",2

Reading the book made the rattle sensible. However, as nothing is perfect, it would have been great if there was discussion about scenarios in which more than one pattern could have been used and how would each scenario fare. Well, such thing can make a book by itself. However, such comparison makes it easier to comprehend the application of patterns which is harder than understanding a pattern in a given example.

If you look closely at any WELL DESIGNED system, you will see that it is simply of composite of the patterns in this book, implemented in a thoughtful way.

This book deserves its reputation. It has a prominent place on my shelf, where I can reach it easily. That's because I use it a lot.
A note of caution: This book is definitely not a tutorial! I first tried using the book to learn patterns, and got nowhere. If you want to learn design patterns, I'd suggest Martin, ""Agile Software Development"". It covers several key patterns and the principles that govern their use. Another great book on the subject is Fowler, ""Refactoring"". This book shows how to first write code that works, then massage the working code into design patterns to increase its flexibility.",10
Glen Ford,5.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,Good for the novice too,"At first, I thought of this book as a little over my head since I haven't really programmed in a true object-oriented language like Java. (Creating custom objects in JavaScript is a good introduction, but concepts like subclassing, polymorphism and strong data typing can't be practiced.)
However, I now find as I prepare to use Java for the first time that the design patterns presented here are fairly easy to understand, and to imagine real-world applications for the examples certainly help a lot). Instead of a book to read to improve your OO skills, I'd recommend this as a *prerequisite* to OOA/OOD/OOP, something to get the cerative juices flowing about how to decompose a system into objects in a truly extensible way.
Of course, the best introduction to OO concepts still has to be ""Object-Oriented Analysis and Design"" by Grady Booch.",2

It did a great job in quickly introducing me to patterns and is an essential reference in my collection. The best part about this book is it's organization and use of Case Studies. I am not a C++ or a SmallTalk programmer so Java examples would be nice, but this was released around 1995 so I can't possibly be critical of there choices. I recommend anyone involved with software design read this.",1
xelaju,4.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,It's the classic text on design patterns,"My only critique of the book is that it is very heavy on examples. It is all relevant and if you have the time to read and digest it all you will be a better programmer. However, there are more consice books that do a better job of distilling the important concepts of design patterns and books that provide better modern approachs. This is the type of book that you have to read in school becuase it is a classic. I would equate to classic literature like Homer or War and Peace. They are important in a scholarly sense if you wants a deep historic understanding of the topic. However, you can understand and use design patterns without reading other books and you will save a lot of time.

Another good analogy is the way calculus is taught in school. First they teach you in-depth complicated way. They take you through all the steps the inventor went through to come up with it. Then they show you the short cuts that are used in common practice. You have a better understanding of the topic because you know the hard way but you would be foolish not use the short cuts.

So you can read this book and get an indepth understanding or you can skip this step and go straight the a consice book that shows you how patterns are used practically today.",7

King L. Wilder,3.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,A little over my head,"This book is just ""OK"" for me but that's only due to the fact that I don't know SmallTalk or C++. I was able to follow the descriptions of how the design patterns work, but that's because I already read the Head First Design Patterns book, which for me was a much better instruction on Design Patterns.

This book is probably very informative to someone who has a Computer Science background, but for the relatively moderate programmer and someone who doesn't know the particular languages the book covers, it may not be valuable.

Side note: the authors are the ""Gang Of Four"" who are famous for Design Patterns designs and their web site, [...] is a good resource for patterns in other languages. I'm a C# developer and they have a package available with examples of all the designs patterns that I've found invaluable.",2

SchmidtD,3.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,"A brilliant collection, not the show-stopper I had expected","Perhaps simply because the Gamma book is so well known, and therefore the ideas of class uses are so well known, I found reading in this book to be somewhat ho-hum. Certain Ideas have still popped out at me, but for the most part I find myself engaging in my own classification of class uses inspired by the text more than learning great things directly from what's on the page. Perhaps this is the real utility of this book, to keep us thinking, evaluating. Next to that it is nice to know that when you see or use one of the famous classifications you do REALLY know what you are talking about.

All-in-all this is one of the classics you might be safe pretending you have read, again because the ideas it puts forth are so well disseminated into the field. But also a little because it isn't the same kind of mind-blowing exposition as the Dragon book (Principles of Compiler Design) or Meyer's outline of OOP in his Eiffel text.",1
Tom,4.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,Decent but hard to read images on kindle,"Overall the book has some good points. Some of which I will use immediately. I would however like to see some more examples of practical use of the design patterns with a focus on C++ and Python. More importantly building an API in C++ and using python bindings to have your front facing python API. Most of this I have learned on my own through experience. But overall many of the design patterns discussed are rarely used in my industry (films and entertainment). We have to script light and get things done as fast as possible. Having some good example models that are scalable are what we mostly look for in this industry. I would also say you can apply any of the C++ examples to python pretty much line for line. But it would be nice to have a python version of this book since that is the scripting language of choice these days.

I would recommend the book to anyone looking to expand there knowledge of design patterns.",1
Albert,4.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,Provides two important things: common language and recommended solution,"We are not the first ones who need to solve a problem using computers. Many others before us experienced similar problems in the past and we can leverage their knowledge and experience rather than reinventing the wheel. This book provides a list of known problems in specific domains together with a recommended approach or solution. As expected, this book does not capture all known problems but focuses on a common subset. With that said, the solutions described here will help you understand why software is developed is a particular way.

Together with a recommended solution to a given problem, this book also provides a common language. For example the term ""Flyweight"" has a specific meaning in computer programming and it can be Googled up. If each team that makes use of this patter refers to it differently, then it would be very hard for everyone to exchange ideas and communicate.",1

I didn't read any other books on the subject so I can't compare it anything, but this book is fantastic read and I am a better programmer now.

Mark Davey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,Amazing book,"The book that changed the software world in 1995 and still the definitive book even though its in its first edition 10 years later. It authors have the nickname ""The Gang Of Four"" because it is so seminal that just referencing the four authors defines the book and its impact.

The idea behind this book is simple, almost all programming projects are based a few basic designs with modifications for particular aspect of the project. This book describes those basic designs as a set of pre-defined patterns (named) and identifies how you can extend those patterns to the projects specific needs in a neat orderly manner.

This is not the book to read if you are new to Object Oriented Programming, but if you understand the principles of OOP and OOA then this is a great place to jump in at the deep end.

If you are programming in n.NET of J2EE and doing any serious programming this books describes well how to leverage patterns to these environments. You will start to understand why these program frameworks have been created and how to leverage them.

If you find this book to daunting try the O'Reilly book ""Head First Design Patterns"", it's quirky and fun and much more accessible.",3

It turns out that not only is everything in this book still relevant, but it seems to be the primary source of information for most of the other books and websites you'll find today.

As others have mentioned, it might not be right for those still learning to program as it's primarily intended to solve problems you'll encounter after you've been writing software long enough to have problems to solve.

The two stars I gave this book applies only to the Kindle edition. Specifically, whatever scanning was done to digitize this book butchered the diagrams. They are very low resolution and the text on them is nearly impossible to read. This is a big problem as the diagrams are very helpful when working through the written content. It is very nice to be able to search, highlight, annotate, and access your book from anywhere, but in my opinion essentially losing the diagrams is not a reasonable tradeoff. There are also some OCR errors sprinkled around. Nothing that makes the text confusing, just some 'i's for 'l's that I've noticed, but it just makes this version even more disappointing.

C. Ehret,3.0 out of 5 stars,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,Written BY Academics FOR Academics,"I think I've found the cure for insomnia!

I majored in Engineering Math and Computer Science in college; so I'm not having any trouble comprehending the material -- I'm having trouble staying awake while reading it! I've been working professionally as a programmer since 1995, and one of the things I dread in trying to keep up with ever-changing programming tools, techniques, and languages is having to wade through academic treatises such as this one.

Now, I'm only 22 pages into a nearly 400 page book, but the writing style is definitely more geared toward academics and theoreticians than practicing software developers. Case in point is the following excerpt from page 22:

""An object-oriented program's run-time structure often bears little resemblance to its code structure. The code structure is frozen at compile-time; it consists of classes in fixed inheritance relationships. A program's run-time structure consists of rapidly changing networks of communicating objects. In fact, the two structures are largely independent. Trying to understand one from the other is like trying to understand the dynamism of living ecosystems from the static taxonomy of plants and animals, and vice versa.""

""...the dynamism...from the static taxonomy...""??? Really? They couldn't come up with a better analogy?

Don't get me wrong, I'm still hopeful that the content of the book will be worth the effort required to trudge my way through the authors' exceedingly dull delivery...but until I get to the meat of the material (which won't happen until around page 81), the struggle will be to say awake long enough to clear more than a couple of pages at a time.

-----
OK, it's taken me 6 weeks, but I finally finished the book. My opinion of the book has improved somewhat. The content of the book is actually very good. Much of it simply puts a name to things that I do in my software development on a regular basis; but, some of the patterns presented have introduced me to some ideas or designs that I hadn't previously been exposed to. I still find the authors' writing style to be dry and off-putting -- it reads like it was written for a master's or doctoral candidate's thesis, and not like it was targeted at a ""practicing"" programmer. Several of the code examples provided are for SmallTalk -- and in the 19 years I've been working as a programmer, I have yet to see a company advertise for SmallTalk programmers...I'm not saying there isn't one, I'm just saying that I haven't seen it. Unfortunately, the authors seem to go out of their way to avoid references to ""Windows"" (the dominant OS, even in 1995 when the book was written / published); instead constantly making references to Unix and a variety of tools that were relatively common on that platform.

I guess my beef is that this book's target audience seems to be a relatively small demographic, while the material itself is of great value to a much larger audience. Instead of targeting the community of programmers as a whole, it seems to focus more on the academic community, and is written in such a way as to appeal to that group. I'd much rather have seen examples and a writing style with broader appeal.

If I were to give separate ratings to content and writing style, I'd rate the content at 4-stars (maybe 4.5), but the writing style is only 2-stars. Overall, I'm increasing my original 2-star rating to 3-stars.

I'm getting started on reading ""Head First Design Patterns"" -- a different presentation of very similar material. While it may be re-hashing the same material I just read, I'm hoping I'll get more out of a different presentation.",9

Like the Guinness Book of World Records settles arguments between drinkers this book is the final authoritative arbiter when software developers argue about design patterns. This book is also useful for learning how to use design patterns to design and write better code.

It is a testament to the importance of this book that in the ten years since it was published the design patterns community has not really agreed on any additional patterns beyond the 23 defined here--although many more have certainly been proposed. Even more significantly, few have had the courage to suggest that some of the 23 patterns defined here might be of little practical value. Most design pattern book authors since treat these exact same patterns. I suspect their publishers insist on it because that's what the buying public seems to want. As a result it is certainly fair to say that once you buy this book you don't really need to buy any more books on the subject.

In fact, one might argue that this book is one of the few design patterns book you can buy that is 100% focused on helping developers write better code. Other books that dare to introduce valuable new ideas on design patterns typically include an explicit acknowledgement that the ideas that can't be traced back to the Gang of Four. Any time spent defining yourself in terms of the Gang of Four is time that is not being spent advancing the field itself or helping developers.

Another indication of the importance of this book is that fact that other design pattern authors often quote it directly, particularly the short definitions of the design patterns. This might suggest that other authors find it difficult to understand some of the 23 patterns well enough to be able to clearly and confidently explain them in their own words. Whatever the actual reason, it certainly indicates that if you want to buy a book on design patterns, this is the book to buy.

I wish the authors of this book would publish an official statement giving their disciples explicit permission to move forward with design patterns, improving and adapting them, adding new ones and letting those that haven't stood the test of time gracefully fade away. As it is, the study of design patterns is in danger of becoming a study of this book rather than a study of how to actually write better code using patterns.

I'll close with a significant and apparently overlooked line from the preface of this book:

""We don't consider this collection of design patterns complete and static; it's more a recording of our current thoughts on design.""",15

As Venkat Subramaniam defined them at a conference, the patterns are like your grandma's recipes: you can write it down as best as you can but it will never turn out the same! And it's true. Besides the most obvious and broadly used patterns, like Singleton, many of the described patterns can be confusing, repetitive and somewhat obscure to the uninitiated reader. Moreover, many patterns are superseded by functional programming concepts such as functions as first class objects, mixins, non-blocking concurrency, map/reduce, etc. which make many patterns easier to understand and implement in terms of functional concepts (even using non-functional languages).",5

The examples are outdated, and don't directly apply to developers using modern languages like C#/Java. I mean using sub-classing for method callbacks is one such example, gimme a break. With that said, this book I'm sure was groundbreaking when it was written when a lot of this stuff was not well known. However, being a programmer of the modern age, most of these patterns are intrinsic and intuitive. Most of these patterns I've used throughout my career, I just didn't know what they were formally called.

My only complaint is with consistency. The author is obviously a highly intelligent individual and shows prowess in teaching and explaining esoteric issues. The problem I have is that this is not always the case. I am absolutely certain if the author was shown some areas of the book and asked if that is the absolute best way he could explain something he would have to answer no. There is just no way he can spend 2-3 pages explaining something with such finesse and clarity that a third grader could understand it and a half a page on something else with none of the privileges normally granted to a largely lay audience with respect to subjects in the book(I'm assuming most of the people who read this book are not math or physics PhDs).

He went from expounding a theme or point beautifully to dropping a rather complex and esoteric issue with basically no explanation. I'm not sure if this is only my sentiment but there are definitely major issues I felt needed to be talked about a little more. As he sort of gave us a bottom-up development of the math and notions he was putting forth, slacking in a few areas is really detrimental to appreciation of the book.

Hofstadter juxtaposes the main themes of the title perfectly so that the reader, who had completely accepted his well-reasoned logic over the last chapter, sees it turned inside-out in the next chapter by some goofy dialogue between the Tortoise and Achilles.

This book is about the meaning of meaning, the interpretation of interpreting, thinking about thinking, and being about being.

Bennybob,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid",A misunderstood classic,"This is NOT a casual read. Hofstadter's little ""doorstopper"" covers such diverse topics as philosophy, computer languages, classical music, art, mental mapping, and Zen poetry, and wraps them up into a series of alternating essays and stories about fantasy characters. The main players are the Tortoise and Achilles, who spend the majority of the book discussing (and introducing) the themes covered in depth by the essay chapters in between.

The general effect is that, upon reading it, you get the feeling that it was about... something? Something to do with an artist, a composer and a mathematician, all linked together in a strange loopy kind of way. It can be confusing as hell, but slowly the ideas presented in the book seep in, and you get a - slightly - better understanding of the themes in the book.

I say ""a misunderstood classic"" because most people who attempt to describe the book (myself included) can only do so in the broadest terms; the actual book is far more complex, much like a fractal can appear simple but is really subtly intricate. Furthermore, the author laments in his follow-up ""I Am A Strange Loop"" that most of the readers only saw the outer layer of ""a book with a bunch of weird themes and stories"" and totally missed his underlying message; that the whole of any given system, such as mathematics (or human self-identity), can behave totally logically and consistently within itself but also allow bizarre concepts that both follow the rules and break them at the same time.

In short, no self-contained system is foolproof, or paradox-proof.

Rob Kroese,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid",GEB: EGB puts the I in Intelligence,"GEB: EGB is basically an exploration of the idea of intelligence, artificial and otherwise. Hofstader's goal is to shed some light on how intelligence / consciousness / self-awareness happens. I would call him a materialist, in the sense that he believes that there is a physical basis for thoughts, feelings and emotions. He is dismissive of ""soulists,"" who believe that there is some sort of inexplicable metaphysical aspect to consciousness.

The question, in Hofstader's mind, is, ""If the human brain is made of essentially the same stuff as a kitchen table or a pocket calculator or a tree, why does the first have a sense of of self -- of being an 'I' -- whereas the others do not? Hofstader explores how physical activity in the brain, which seems completely mechanistic and completely unlike the process of thought that we experience, can in fact give rise to a qualitatively different sort of activity occurring at the ""higher levels"" of the brain. He gives several examples of such systems, such as an ant colony: the individual ants are stupid, acting in response to basic stimula, but the colony as a whole is much smarter.

This kind of qualitative difference between the different levels of a system is key to Hofstader's thesis that critics of the possibility of artificial intelligence have misinterpreted the implications of such limitative notions as Godel's theorem. Godel's theorem states, in essence, that any sufficiently powerful system will contain truths that are not provable within the system. The problem with computers, these critics charge, is that they are stuck within a particular system -- there is no way to program them to realize that there is no solution to a particular problem within the system, even though such a fact would be perfectly obvious to an intelligent person who can ""jump out of the system."" So the computer is stuck trying to solve the problem with a method that is doomed to fail.

Hofstader argues, on the other hand, that there is nothing magical about being able to jump out of the system and reflect on whether it is the appropriate system to be using. In fact, in doing this one is still ""in"" a system -- it's just a bigger system, one that has the ability to think about lower level systems. And one can jump out of that top level system and reflect on it as well -- but then of course one has entered a new system again. There's always another system, at a higher level, no matter how high up you go.

At a certain point these levels blur together, because they are recursive -- meaning they reflect back on themselves. Hofstader uses the works of Escher and Bach to illustrate the concept of recursivity. For example, there is Escher's stairway that goes up and up until you are back where you started, or the two hands, each of which is drawing the other.

Hofstader believes that self-awareness -- the ""I"" -- arises from this kind of recursivity. To put it very simply, at the highest levels the brain is a system that deals with symbols, and the ""I"" is the symbol for the system itself.

There is much, much more to this book. There are lengthy tangents into mathematics, philosophy, biology (the section about the recursion that takes place in the copying of DNA is particularly fascination), etc.

Thankfully the book is organized into sections that alternate between straight exposition of some concept and a fictional dialogue that illustrates the concept. Still, it's not light reading, and I did wish at points that there was a Reader's Digest version that would just give me the main points without going off on a tangent for 30 pages about wasps or something.

Godel, Escher, Bach made me rethink a lot of my preconceptions about consciousness and artificial intelligence, and is well worth reading the next time you have three months to spare.",5

David Brockert,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid",reconciling the software of the mind with the hardware of brain,"This book has a preface by the author. After twenty (20) or so pages, I was thinking, ""Can I understand what he wrote about in the rest of this book?"" but I persevered and read the whole book. This book is intense, like any philosophical book. His motive is to ""suggest ways of reconciling the software of the mind with the hardware of brain"" and that is quite an endeavor he succeeds at, sort of. No wonder he won the Pulitzer prize for this book. He talks of how he came to write and develop the book, and then, upon preparing for republication, he decides to not redo the book: it is what it is, from back then, any addition or correction would create a new book, and it can been seen every so often he imagines some stuff that we use daily, like spell correction, that were just not available back then. If he was to do that, he might as well write a whole new book, and that was not in the cards, nor was it the purpose of the new edition.
Gödel goosed him to realize the notions he writes about, but Escher and Bach represent examples of what Gödel was writing and he is thinking about. As you read the introduction you realize this is one educated and well rounded fellow. He describes the development of Bach's preludes and fugues like a music teacher (I realized that I have a recording of Wanda Landowsky playing ""The Well-Tempered Clavier"" Book 1, preludes and fugues, but that did not help me understand as you will see). Bach worked up various themes and notions through his music and than then did some fancy finagling and out came some thing wild and crazy wonderful. I listened to the recording I have to no avail. This is something you get to know by playing and playing the tunes, a lot, for yourself, but Mr. Hofstadter's exposition explains what is what for you. Escher is easier (visual experiences are more important or easier to comprehend than aural experiences). The pictures are presented as examples of repetition or growth from one thing into another. The idea of repeating or self-reference is important: it is one thing that computers do not do. We can do imagining things as well, but at a more basic level we self-reference creating a hump of ability that computers have to accomplish if they are to get to be self aware or intelligent.
As he said, he wants to understand the hardware of the brain, but in comparison, computers are simpler, but getting more complicated. He is working from the bottom up with computers: machine language, assembly, programing languages, etc. Fro our brains he is working from the top down, trying to see how the thoughts (software) we think get from one point to another. It is difficult because we do not have access to the basic growth of each thought (neurons firing). Logic tries, yet, as that one guy two (2) or three (3) thousand years ago said, ""All I know is that I do not know anything."" Mr. Hofstadter just comes to that thought in another roundabout way. I kept thinking of sex deviants doing what they do and that if we could look into their heads, we would be hard pressed to see where the impetus for their deviant behavior comes from, how it develops or why they do it. It is somewhere in there, but the thoughts (software) are so complicated that we can not see how it develops into what is expressed. I also think of how we all speak. We talk without thinking (something I am accused of constantly and embarrassingly), but in reality we just do not follow the thought process from what we hear and see, etc., to what we think of it, to what we will say, to saying it. Another thought is what is happening in the brains of mediators, you know, those Zen folks who quiet the mind, what is happening in there then? The mind is just amazing in what it does.
Throughout this book Mr. Hofstadter writes of the mind and the brain like a psychologist, how it works and what it does. He also delves into genetics. His forte is math and all its intricacies. He develops a couple of different math models to illustrate Gödel's incompleteness theorem. The logic starts out straight forward enough, then veers off into some esoteric realm where the notion of paradox lives, and this is where we have to develop our math notions. We can study the properties of prime numbers or infinities, but we always must end up knowing we do not know everything, because our logic can not encompass paradoxes, and they will be somewhere in all we do, or something like that.
As you can see, I was not able to understand his math models, but I think I got the jist of it.
This book reminds me of another book published in 1978, ""The Seven Mysteries of Life"" by Guy Murchie. It is amazing that they talk of the same things in the same way and for the same reasons. Though this is a treatise on computers and artificial intelligence, and the other is a religious book, sort of, about the awesomeness of life.
As for the artificial intelligence aspect, I like his development towards that goal, but, and I find no fault in the imagining of it, I am disappointed that computers will just be like us. It will not create a Spock like machine, or what science fiction has led us to hope for (see Isaac Asimov, ""I, Robot"" etc.). I did like his notion of combining genotypes to create new genes, but I am a guy and I like that sort of stuff. I find that I agree with someone who said, ""There are much more fun ways to create intelligence, and it is not artificial."" If artificial intelligence is not going to be all that great, it is only good to try to develop it for the exercise and the experience it will give us, but otherwise, eh, no big deal.",3

Jeffrey Van Wagoner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid",What is consciousness?,"I read this book with a study group and we an enjoyable time going through it. The group is made up of highly technical people and we all had a good time trying to find all of the author's hidden illustrations of the points he was trying to make. We also discovered why it was important that the book be in printed format (as opposed to a Kindle edition). It turns out that there are many illustrations in the format of the book where points are being made. It would be very difficult to transfer this to a variable electronic format (perhaps a fixed PDF format would work). Overall this was a fun book not only for leaning about AI, but also for those that like doing puzzles. Almost everything in the book has a secondary or tertiary meaning.

The whole point of the book is to show the author's theory of consciousness and relates it to `strange loops'. This is not made clear until the end of the book. The path to get there is very entertaining and educational. We are forced to look at the world differently than we are used to and I found it very thought provoking. The use of Godel, Escher, and Bach to illustrate his points proved to be very powerful. I developed a much greater appreciation for the work of these men.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a major subject in this book, and even though the book was written clear back in 1979, our resident AI expert was amazed at how this book has aged so well over the last 33 years.

I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in expanding their horizons. It has really helped me look at things quite differently.",2
T. Allen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid",Found someone who thinks like I do!,"""Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."" - Hofstadter's Law

I've been a professional self-taught software engineer for 7 years at this point, with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and until last year, I'd never even heard of cognitive science. I've known of Hofstadter's law in my field, but I never had any idea who he was either.

Not having the fortunate experience to find like minded people at a university, I've met very few people in my life who I could have the type of conversations I wanted to have.

That started to change last year when I began meeting people in college, one introduced me to cognitive science. I also met another pair of room mates, a mathematician and a music major that I had the most amazing conversations with them, and this book on their bookshelf caught my eye.

I started reading about cognitive science, music, and math theory more and one name kept popping up, Hofstadter. Then I saw that he was the author of this book.

So I took the plunge and bought this book, and several of his others. It has been one of the best experiences I've ever had to read this.

Hofstadter, at 27, wrote this book. It is a huge relief to see someone write about subjects which my mind has wandered to so many times, when they were the same age as me. Someone with the knowledge and ability to discuss the ideas extremely well.

Even with my lack of formal training, he explains concepts of propositional logic, classical music, and art in ways that are easy to understand. I'm still only half way through the book, and it's already the most amazing book I've ever had the pleasure to read.

The book is very thought provoking, and one I'd highly recommend to anyone who is interested in any of the subjects he speaks of throughout the book, which there are many. They are all tied together so well, and though the theme of the book is very hard to describe, it all seems interconnected.

Nothing I could say, could truly do this book justice. If you're thinking about buying it already, just buy it, and enjoy it. You won't regret it.",1
Prime reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid",Wonderful book!,"The book juxtaposes the works of mathematician Gödel, graphic artist Escher and music composer Bach to bring out the paradox of 'self-reference' embedded in their works. Author and neuroscientist Hofstadter uses this common theme to explore human cognition and artificial intelligence. A self-referential system that loops within itself infinitely can only be studied by getting out of the system and observing it from meta level. Written in the the spirit of Lewis Carroll as a dialogue between tortoise and achilles, Gödel, Escher and Bach, the book explores human cognition and artificial intelligence. The challenge with trying to understand human cognition and consciousness is that one has to get out of the human system!

P.S. The book is by no means an easy read. There are lectures by MIT available in YouTube on the book but they cover only the Gödel aspect and briefly touch on Escher but do not cover Bach.",1
Andrew Finch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid",Wonderful,"This is an incredible book. Not only does it make the maze of modern physics, mathematics and philosophy more comprehensible, but it pulls all disciplines together in a wonderful mix of various formats, from dialogues to pictures to complex explanations. The beauty of this all is that you can dip in at any part and find something interesting and inspiring. If you don't get on well with the explanations, try some dialogues, or read the author's commentary about the pictures. If you have time to work through the whole book, it will be well worth it.

As an ex-music student, I found the ""Bach"" sections less convincing than the rest, but I agree that Bach was quite a mathematician as well as being a musician and a composer. To link his work and his name with John Cage is quite something, but the author pulls it off.

I also like the way that these great names are brought together and shown to be speaking about the same things - a universality that perhaps is at theheart of this book.

Very much recommended for a user-friendly exploration into sicentific, musical, mathematical, and philosophical ideas.",7

Shooshie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid",Transfiguration in Print,"I read this book in 1980, and each chapter of it still stands out in my mind in glittering bas-relief against all I read before or have read since. What stands out the most, however, is that my thinking changed after reading this book. Everything since reading it has been inevitably processed through its filter, which has quite simply changed my life. Perhaps a first-reading today would not have an equal effect; in 1980 it was timely. Things we take for granted now were difficult to conceptualize then--the internet, for instance. But I'll leave it for contemporary readers to decide whether Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid is as eternal as the title claims. For me, the answer is a resounding yes. I can say without doubt that my life would have been different if I had not read it at that time.

Ok, if it's so great, then what is it that makes it so? Trying to describe what is great about this book is like trying to say what is great about a particular Bach Fugue, or an Escher print. A fugue doesn't typically have a great melody. The rhythm can be monotonous and predictable. You know where it begins and where it will end up, and the subjects will enter on cue and not deviate from their lines. Escher's prints, similarly, are composed of mediocre representations of their subjects. Shading is not sublime, some of the features may be grotesque. What is it, then, that makes that fugue or that print great? Ahhh... that's the subject of this book, and in beautifully crafted recursion, its own principles apply equally to itself.

You will come away with an understanding of the underlying principles of intelligence, beauty, craft, logic, and universal principles of creation. A deeper appreciation for those things does not necessarily mean a simpler or easier means of describing same. In fact, it may be the opposite, sort of ""the more you know, the more you know you don't know."" This confrontation with, and participation in, the infinite seems to be the root of our longing--a sense that Bach, Escher, and Gödel weaved intuitively into their own work without feeling compelled to explain.

So, rather than expect to come away from this book with the answers to the big quiz of life, I would say what one is more likely to find is a deepening of ""mu,"" a rendering of knowledge into its proper place where ""answers"" in the Western sense dissolve into the questions in a deepening spiral of association and metaphor to the point at which one sees so many possibilities that the original question loses its significance. So is it nirvana? Not this book. But one may get caught up in the craft of the author and his inspirations to the point that one might feel lifted up and deposited at the trailhead of a new path, and the best that one can expect in this life is a new, sublime path. I think Hofstadter would agree that nirvana, should it exist, is the path, not the destination, and this book may well prove the author to be a willing bodhisattva.

Relentless,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid","Great Book, Too many threads at once.","This book's attempt at explaining this seeming common thread in Mathematical Logic, Music and Art is a noble one. The author tries to explain, in my opinion, too many things at once. Even though the author is never incoherent, the vast task of explaining not only his thesis but also the history behind it, overwhelms the reader time and time again.
As a mathematics student and enthusiast, this book had a very profound impact in the way I think about mathematics. The fact that mathematics (being as complex as it is) cannot be proven by using mathematics is a very, if not the most, important concept this book attempts to uncover.
As far as the historical/biographical aspect of the book, I think it's very well done and very well contextualized.
The book about three of the most important geniuses in areas so diverse and seemingly disconnected, yet in the innermost layer they all are intertwined. Again, great book, great author, spell-bounding conclusions.
I, however, have couple of caveats (to the reader):
1) This book requires some knowledge in mathematical logic,
2) It is not an ""easy read,"" so be prepared to be mentally challenged.",6
Penguin Pete,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid",A challenge for any intellect,"What can I possibly say about this fantastic work that hasn't been said already? There are thousands of rave reviews for this magnum opus, and you should believe every single one of them, and even after that, when you're actually reading GEB, you'll *still* be impressed!

I can only add this: I don't go around saying this often (sshhh! don't tell anyone.) but I happen to have tested high on IQ tests. I'm in the neighborhood of Mensa caliber. I put as much stock in that as I would in a horoscope and you should too, but for what it's worth, as far as we can possibly measure intelligence, I am officially classified as ""goddamn smart"".

And even *I* find GEB a challenging, challenging read!

I've read Stephen Hawking, Martin Gardner, A.K. Dewdney, Richard Feynmann, and Shakespeare, but it is Douglas Hofstadter who makes me have to slow down, reread, study, stop and think it over. I can't read this work straight through; I have to take it at about a sub-chapter per week. Of course, I also have to stop and write a shell script to play with some of the problems and exercises put forth in the book, so that slows me down too.

Science fiction author Larry Niven used a phrase ""playgrounds for the mind"", which is exactly what this book is - but it's a challenging course that will stretch and exercise mental muscles long-rusted and forgotten in our pop-culture society.",2

It is certainly a fascinating read, the kind of book that effortlessly discusses everything from computers to art, from paradoxes to physics, from philosophy to tortoises, and seemingly everything in between.

However, the reason I don't give it a 5/5 is that I didn't think that it all ever really coalesced into any singular idea. Other reviewers see it as a profound meditation on the concept of consciousness or something. To me, it just seemed like a hodge-podge of neat stuff. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I think if you go in expecting a revolutionary work, you might be a bit disappointed.

Still, it's such a hefty book, its easy to recommend as a sort of ""desert island"" kind of book. It's not just the thickness of the book, but the sheer density on each page. Most chapters contain logic games and stuff which you really should try out if you want to get the most out of the book. It's not the kind of book that you can just zip right through.

The book purports to mainly be about cognitive science, but it draws heavily on mathematics, as well as parallels in music and drawings (which is not hard to deduce from the title :)). At the same time, it's a highly entertaining read (and it is not a book on mathematics or art - I don't understand why some reviewers find fault with too light a treatment of these subjects - the book, seemingly, was never intended to be technical).
Aside from the stuff within, for me the book has been a launching pad of many tangential ideas and many a clarification to my personal philosophy and view of the world - it makes you think.

As the result, GEB is perhaps 5X longer than it really needed to be.

(& so on). IMHO, there is nothing really profound about this concept. Beyond this idea, Hofstadter offers few, if any, new insights into how thinking machines could be implemented. In many ways GEB is a beautifully written book, but the emphasis appears to be on showcasing Hofstadter's cultural IQ rather than providing insight into how the mind might work. Perhaps GEB is so revered because there are few really good philosophical books on AI for out there, and some are much worse (like Kuzwell's ""The Age of Spiritual Machines"").",61

But I'm a little annoyed that I bought this book. I won't tell you not to buy it. But I highly recommend browsing through it at a book store or library. It's a great title, and a terrific premise. However, it's extremely logical (for those of you who haven't taken logic/statistics or higher math, you're in for 800 pages of confusion). Perhaps if I was a programmer, this book would have done something different for me. I know that I'm in the minority here, but I offer this review based on my own experiences.

Brennan C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Best machine learning book for people without a formal math background,"I do not have a formal math background and I am able to follow this book. It is very easy to understand for a self motivated learner. The highest math class I have taken was Calculus in high school; the rest has been supplemental from various online videos and wikipedia articles. The author provides both the symbolic mathematical explanation as well as the geometric meaning in graphs. This really helps to clarify things. I am learning the math, the techniques, and the intuition behind it as well. This is rare to find all in one source but this book manages to do an excellent job at it.",9
e,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Still (one of) the best,"I recently had to quickly understand some facts about the probabilistic interpretation of pca. Naturally I picked up this book and it didn't disappoint. Bishop is absolutely clear, and an excellent writer as well.

In my opinion, despite the recent publication of Kevin Murphy's very comprehensive ML book, Bishop is still the gold standard. This is mostly because of his incredible clarity, but the book has other virtues: best in class diagrams, judiciously chosen; a lot of material, very well organized; excellent stage setting (the first two chapters). Now, sometimes he's a bit cryptic, for example, the proof that various kinds of loss lead to conditional median or mode is left as an exercise (ex 1.27). Murphy actually discusses it in some detail. This is true in general: Murphy actually discusses many things that Bishop leaves to the reader. I thought chapters three and four could have been more detailed, but I really have no other complaints.

Please note that in order to get an optimal amount out of reading this book you should already have a little background in linear algebra, probability, calculus, and preferably some statistics. The first time I approached it was without any background and I found it a bit unfriendly and difficult; this is no fault of the book, however. Still, you don't need that much, just the basics.

Update: I should note that there are some puzzling omissions from this book. E.g. f-score & confusion matrices are not mentioned (see Murphy section 5.7.2) - it would have been very natural to mention these concepts in ch 1, along with decision theory. Nor is there much on clustering, except for K-means (see Murphy ch 25). Not a huge deal, it's easy to get these concepts from elsewhere. I recommend using Murphy as and when you need, to fill in gaps.

One more update: I've been getting into Hastie et al's ESL recently, and I'm really impressed with it so far - I think the practitioner should probably get familiar with both ESL and PRML, as they have complementary strengths and weaknesses. ESL is not very Bayesian at all; PRML is relentlessly so. ESL does not use graphical models or latent variables as a unifying perspective; PRML does. ESL is better on frequentist model selection, including cross-validation (ch 7). I think PRML is better for graphical models, Bayesian methods, and latent variables (which correspond to chs 8-13) and ESL better on linear models and density based methods (and other stuff besides). Your mileage may vary...They are both excellent books. ESL seems a bit more mathematically dense than PRML.",4
R,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Classic and insightful but does not sufficiently cover important non-Bayesian approaches,"This graduate-level book is a very good reference for classic pattern recognition and machine learning methods. It might not be the best book for a first-time learner though since the author tends to jump-step a lot. This is understandable considering the amount of content and insightful discussions covered. For advanced learners, this book is one of the best.

This book tend to focus only on probabilistic, in particular, Bayesian methods (and does an excellent job doing that). Other important methods are mentioned very briefly or only discussed from the Bayesian perspective. I believe that each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses and this book does not do those approaches enough justices. Therefore, this book is definitely not a comprehensive reference for pattern recognition and machine learning as it discusses these problems from mainly one perspective. But if your studies are in these areas, this is one of the top 5, must-have reference books.",3

My main criticism is that Bishop seldom motivates material with real-world examples or explains why you'd prefer one technique to another.

It's not suggested as a prerequisite, but to understand the book, you'd almost certainly need some exposure to mathematical statistics: I've taken a few graduate-level courses in probability and statistics, and I struggled at first with some of the Bayesian stuff in the beginning chapters.",3

This book is very unreadable and annoying, and I often cannot understand what the author is talking about. It should be listed to be a reference, not a textbook, since most of the classical results can be found here. But if you want to first study machine learning, it will become a big disaster.

I recommend ""Elements of Statistical Learning"" for advanced readers.

There are some fantastic chapters in this book. Chapter 3 on linear regression and its Bayesian variants in particular is beautiful and deep. Other chapters falter, like chapter 8 on Bayesian networks which is maddening. The book has an emphasis on deriving formulas as opposed to showing practical examples; those looking for more practical matters should read The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie instead. I find the book is very useful as a reference when elaborating non-standard machine learning methods. The appendices on probability distributions and matrix properties are indispensable, in particular. Some widely used methods are glossed over (boosting for example), while others, like the relevance vector machine, are described in detail despite not being well-represented in the literature. That being said, the breadth of methods presented in the book is much greater than in other similar books, and I frequently reread it when I get stumped on a machine learning problem.",5
IB,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),"Overall good, lots of potential for improvement","Overall, I like the book and would recommend it. But the exposition could use significant polishing.

Pros:
- not mathematically heavy; lots of good heuristics that capture the math without delving too far in
- choice of topics and their discussion (e.g. a great place to learn about kernel methods and graphical models)
- easy to get hooked on if you mind the gaps

Cons:
- read below...

While the exposition is spotty (compare e.g. with Feller or Gelman), the author manages to follow a mostly linear exposition on fascinating topics.

The book would highly benefit from editing provided by someone with a solid math background. In particular, there are more good mistakes than bad mistakes... Often when speaking with people with more stats background than me, the conversation is isomorphic to:

Me: ""...therefore, this statement is wrong. I think what he meant was...""
Bro: ""Ah yes. But you get it, that's what he meant""
Me: ""Then why didn't he write it?""

But at least dialogues like these help cement ideas...

Please correct me if any of the following contentions are wrong (I may update as I continue to read):

Some parts are not even wrong, for example:
Sec 2.1, paragraph above Eq. 2.19
""We see that this sequential approach to learning arises naturally when we adopt a Bayesian viewpoint. It is independent of the choice of prior and of the likelihood functions and depends only on the assumption of i.i.d data""

First, if you follow the thread of this section and therefore go back to the contrived coin-flipping example, you would see that in the non-Bayesian point of view estimates are also updated in a sequence of experiments. Hence, a Bayesian point of view in this case is no more ""natural"" than a frequentist. Second, by definition of i.i.d., a single fixed distribution is postulated to exist, and therefore a prior is in fact chosen: how do you define a posterior without a prior? But ok, I think I get it: a sequential approach fits in nicely with the Bayesian point of view - I agree, and that's all that needs to be said.

Mathematically wrong:
Same section, following 2.3.5, the statement(s) following Eq. (2.20)
""Note that in the limit of an infinitely large data set m, l -> infinity the result (2.20) reduces to the maximum likelihood (2.8).""

First, if F is a function of x, then the resulting limit for x to infinity must not involve x. Plus, the order and/or direction of his m and l in the limit is ambiguous. Second, what he meant to say is that for m and l both sufficiently large compared with a and b, we get that (2.20) reduces to (2.8).

3rd paragraph before 2.2:
""For a finite data set, the posterior mean for mu always lies between the prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimate for mu corresponding to the relative frequencies of events given by (2.7).""

Again we are told to forget that the choice of a prior makes a difference. It seems the above statement is false: we may choose a prior that is heavily weighted on a single point so that this prior's mean is greater than mle.

Paragraphs directly above the beginning of 2.2:
""In fact, we might wonder whether it is a general property of Bayesian learning that, as we observe more and more data, the uncertainty represented by the posterior distribution will steadily decrease...""
and then
"" this result shows that, on average, the posterior variance of theta is smaller than the prior variance.""
The ""result"", i.e. Eq (2.24) is an assertion of the form: ""Suppose a,b, c > 0, c is fixed, and c = a +b. Then, if b goes up, a must go down."" I don't see how this relates to what seemed to be his premise that increasing the size of a data set (sequentially or not) has the seemingly desired effect of reducing posterior variance. I suspect there are in fact limiting results in special cases that show the desired ""steady"" reduction in posterior variance...I wish he would have referenced them

Section 2.3, following Eq. 2.44
""... we note that the matrix \Sigma can be taken to be symmetric...""

Actually, by definition any covariance matrix *is* symmetric.

I could go on...

All this said, it's worth repeating:
I like the book, and not only because its mistakes or sometimes shady logic encourage the interested reader to try and discover correct/less wrong statements.",1
NotNietzsche,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),A slightly abstruse gem,"First, realize that the author has distilled everything he has to say into probably the fewest number of words possible. He is, however, fairly generous with equations, and his derivations are well-presented and easy to follow.

Initially I thought the book was way too dense, and skipped way too many steps, providing what amounted to a rough sketch of the material. That said, after I read the chapters a few times, and consulted other materials, I came to find that every chapter I read in-depth is actually quite thorough.

Cons: Doesn't repeat anything, which is an interesting pedagogical tactic. No examples, so you're on your own in terms of actually implementing these things.
Pros: Provides a relatively large amount of depth on a large number of topics. Equations are derived enough so you really know what's going on.

Bottom line: Buy it. It's dense, and there are no examples, but it's a great staple book because it provides a robust outline of the theory behind many methods. Sure, sometimes you won't know what he's talking about, but you can look up the stuff he leaves out without much fuss. The stuff he does include, though, is very hard to find elsewhere.",3
karen,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Beautiful Text,I'm impressed by the breadth of knowledge the author has accumulated into one text. He dives in from survey-level discussion all the way down through some involved math. The good news is he leaves out some more intensive proofs and just references relevant sources there. The only thing missing for me is a few more practical examples.,1
Subrat,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Great Insights from a practical point of view,"I think this is a great text considering the vast array of topics covered by Bishop in this book. The best thing I liked about the book are the fantastic insights the author has provided on various methods and their usage limitations, sometimes in very easy to understand language and studded with some real practical experience going behind it. One thing which I found rather missing was the excessive use of equations without much dwell into their derivations, which can sometimes confuse the first time reader, but when worked diligently by hand, would make the stuff clearer. Said that, the book is a great text for someone to gain latest perspectives on the field from the author's rich research experience. I would definitely recommend someone who wants a fairly broad and usable knowledge about this field.",2

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),A sound conceptual approach,"Usually considered to be a branch of artificial intelligence, especially at the present time, pattern recognition is defined in this book as the automatic discovery of regularities in data by the use of computer algorithms and the use of these regularities for classifying the data in different categories. The first part of this definition is typically referred to as `unsupervised learning' and the latter `supervised learning.' Both of these areas have resulted in a gargantuan amount of research due to their importance in areas such as medicine, genomics, network modeling, financial engineering, and voice recognition. This book emphasizes a ""conceptual"" approach to teaching pattern recognition, and therefore is highly valuable to those who need to learn the subject. Too often this field is taught purely from the formal standpoint, or conversely by the use of many trivial examples that illustrate the algorithms that are used. These approaches make the subject appear to be either a highly-developed mathematical one (which it is) or a cookbook that does not have a sound foundation. This book is one of the few that will allow the reader to gain a more in-depth understanding and appreciation of the subject as preparation for doing research and development in pattern recognition. The author claims that the book is self-contained as far as background in probability theory is concerned, but readers should still be prepared with this background in order to better appreciate the content. The Bayesian paradigm dominates the book, as it should given the current emphasis in research circles.

Some of the highlights of the book include discussions on:
* Relative entropy and mutual information. These two concepts have become very important in recent years, especially in the validation of pattern recognition models, the selection of relevant variables, and in independent component analysis.
* Periodic variables and how they can be used in contexts where Gaussian distributions are problematic.
* Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, especially the role of the detailed balance condition in obtaining the acceptance probability for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
* Bayesian linear regression and its ability to deal with the over-fitting problem in calculations of maximum likelihood and the determination of model complexity.
* Kernel learning (usually called support vector machines in other books).

Some of the minuses of the book include:
* Needs more in-depth discussion of Bayesian neural networks, over and above what is done in the book. The author's does devote a section in the book to this topic, but given its enormous importance, especially in automated learning and economic forecasting, more examples need to be included.
* More real-world test cases need to be included, along with a comparison of the efficacies of different approaches, so as to illustrate the ""no free lunch"" philosophy.
* More exercises that require more analysis on part of the reader, instead of derivation-type problems or straightforward numerical exercises.
* Needs more details on independent component analysis. Only a few paragraphs are devoted to this important topic.",9
Shuo Li,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Good book about machine learning,"I am a graduate student in computer science and I bought this book for machine learning and data mining course. This is a good book for both starter and professionals. The idea stream is clearly presented and examples are nice. Easy to understand.

But one thing I don't like about this book is that the author used mathematical notations carelessly. For example, lower case function p() represents pdf or/and pmf while capital P() represent the probability. The author didn't separate this. Another problem is that a lot of unnecessary mathematical notations were introduced such that at the end of each chapter I always had to go back to the begining to figure out what those notations mean.

But anyway, this is a really nice book for machine learning, I would definitely recommend this book.",1

I have taken many graduate level courses in these other subjects and this book compliments them well. That being said, other friends that are new to the field find it very difficult to learn from this book. My suggestion is to look up Stephen Boyd's YouTube lectures from Standford as a primer for your class. Linear Algebra and iterative methods are good to know before reading this book.",2
Dan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),good book but maybe a little too thick,Christopher Bishop really knows his stuff and it is obvious by using his book.

There is a considerable amount of math required for understanding -- primarily matrix algebra. There is no computer code, and there are no algorithms. All of the analysis assumes stationary data.

We looked into a few machine learning books and decided that Bishop's book is most suitable for us as new comers to machine learning.

A. Luque,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),A Definitive Reference,"This book is used in an undergraduate statistics course at the University of Chicago.
As a textbook for a class, I believe it does its job well. It doesn't concern itself with silly 'plug and chug' examples and presents the mathematical derivations of each technique clearly and concisely. Obviously, you'll need a background in linear algebra and probability theory. To think that the 5 page introduction to probability theory could possibly be helpful is ridiculous. It helps to also have some programming experience so you can practice implementing the techniques directly.

This is written so as to be helpful as a reference book. Just the other day, I found myself implementing a parallelized feed-forward neural network and quickly picked up the text to see what variations would be helpful. Each topic is generally presented in its basic form with any alternatives and optimizations presented toward the end of the chapter. This meant it was very easy to find what I wanted in seconds.

Although the book covers most of the major techniques (binary classifiers, regressions, vector support machines, neural networks, etc.) and their optimizations, it doesn't concern itself with optimal implementations. This is *not* a machine learning algorithms textbook. This is what you consult if you want to refresh yourself on a particular technique.",1

Bo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),good for the course and research,"A compulsory book required by statistical machine learning, good for the course and research, but not recommend for practical machine learning.",1
A. Stewart,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),"ok book, not great","I have two machine learning books currently; this book and the one by Prince on Computer Vision. I purchased Prince first, and followed up with this book, since in some ways I found Prince lacking some details and found some of his explanations difficult to follow (forward-backward algorithm for example), but overall was is good book and worth getting. I think in someways these two books are good compliments to each other. Prince focus heavily on application and sets up the problem, but does not necessarily tell you how to solve the problems (at least to the satisfaction of someone new to the topic like me). Bishop on the other hand does go through a lot of the details left out in Prince, but lacks examples to reinforce why I would even care about some of the topics covered. For example, I eventually skipped chapter 10 (approximate inference) after not seeing any immediate application for such an abstract topic.

So back to why I am only giving this book only 3 stars. While Bishop does go through much of the math required to solve these types of problems, I ultimately find many of his explanations not very good. As one other reviewer pointed out, he has plenty of figures, but seldom do I think they provide much insight to what he is trying to explain. Case in point figure 11.1 is nothing more than two squiggly lines showing p(z) and f(z), one of which is an arbitrary probability density function and an arbitrary functional mapping of z. I think that by the time most people get being able to understand the material presented up to this point, they don't need this kind of figure. There are a few others, that while not as useless as this, could use a bit more description or clarification. Otherwise these figures are nothing more than squiggly lines.

There are many topics here that I was hoping to learn from. For example, I had never learned anything on neural nets, and there is a whole chapter dedicated to that topic here. Unfortunately, I think the only thing that I can remember from this topic is that there different layers to the net, and I think in the process of him solving the equations of the neural net was ultimately using reverse auto-differentiation, but he even had some other goofy name for it (I think it was backward propagation). Another topic I was hoping to learn from was on support vector machines. I think this suffers from getting so buried in how to solve the problem, that even his examples show fairly complex decision boundaries (Figure 7.2, for example where he doesn't call out on the graph as showing what is what).

And another issue with this is that the book has an appendix which describes the datasets used to generate many of the plots. However, if you go to the URL, the datasets are not there. Granted, the book was published in 2006, so certainly his website could have changed. It just is difficult to try and duplicate his methods to understand what he might ultimately be trying to say here.

All in all, the book isn't bad. I think it works better as someone who already has an application in mind (and which method to use) but needs to be walked through the math to get an answer. After reading this book, I still wouldn't know which technique to use to get an answer to a problem that I have. Prince at least gives some applications and was a really interesting book.

Update 9/22/16:
I maybe was overly hard with my original review, however I will not be updating my star rating which I will explain why shortly. I read another machine learning book after this one ( Barber's Baysian Reasoning and Machine Learning). Overall, that other book is worthy of a 5 star review for learning the basics. After reading that book, which gives plenty of examples and clear explanations, this book does read a lot better. As I originally thought, this book does fill a good role as a book on how to solve problems, but not necessarily as a great starting place for those new to Machine Learning. Check out Barber's book for free from his website, and you will see what I mean.",1
Kinga,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Excellent text,"First of all, as some other reviewers have pointed out, the subtitle of the book should include the word 'Bayesian' in some form or the other. The reason this is important is because the Bayesian approach, although an important one, is not adapted across the board in machine learning, and consequently, an astonishing number of methods presented in the book (Bayesian versions of just about anything) are not mainstream. The recent Duda book gives a better idea of the mainstream in this sense, but because the field has evolved in such rapidity, it excludes massive recent developments in kernel methods and graphical models, which Bishop includes.

Pedagogically, however, this book is almost uniformly excellent. I didn't like the presentation on some of the material (the first few sections on linear classification are relatively poor), but in general, Bishop does an amazing job. If you want to learn the mathematical base of most machine learning methods in a practical and reasonably rigorous way, this book is for you. Pay attention in particular to the exercises, which are the best I've seen so far in such a text; involved, but not frustrating, and always aiming to further elucidate the concepts. If you want to really learn the material presented, you should, at the very least, solve all the exercises that appear in the sections of the text (about half of the total). I've gone through almost the entire text, and done just that, so I can say that it's not as daunting as it looks. To judge your level regarding this, solve the exercises for the first two chapters (the second, a sort of crash course on probability, is quite formidable). If you can do these, you should be fine. The author has solutions for a lot of them on his website, so you can go there and check if you get stuck on some.

As far as the Bayesian methods are concerned, they are usually a lot more mathematically involved than their counterparts, so solving the equations representing them can only give you more practice. Seeing the same material in a different light can never hurt you, and I learned some important statistical/mathematical concepts from the book that I'd never heard of, such as the Laplace and Evidence Approximations. Of course, if you're not interested, you can simply skip the method altogether.

From the preceding, it should be clear that the book is written for a certain kind of reader in mind. It is not for people who want a quick introduction to some method without the gory details behind its mathematical machinery. There is no pseudocode. The book assumes that once you get the math, the algorithm to implement the method should either become completely clear, or in the case of some more complicated methods (SVMs for example), you know where to head for details on an implementation. Therefore, the people who will benefit most from the book are those who will either be doing research in this area, or will be implementing the methods in detail on lower level languages (such as C). I know that sounds offputting, but the good thing is that the level of the math required to understand the methods is quite low; basic probability, linear algebra and multivariable calculus. (Read the appendices in detail as well.) No knowledge is needed, for example, of measure-theoretic probability or function spaces (for kernel methods) etc. Therefore the book is accessible to most with a decent engineering background, who are willing to work through it. If you're one of the people who the book is aimed at, you should seriously consider getting it.

RJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Arguably the best book ever on Machine Learning,"Let me be very honest: If you don't have a strong maths background as is expected from serious researchers in Electrical Engineering or Computer Science, you may NOT find this book useful. I don't think this book should be tried by undergraduates except may be those who are in their final semester. The key aspect of this book is its intuition, that kind of draws a clear picture of what the complex equations mean. In no way,by itself, is Machine Learning an easy topic. So I don't think there is a book that may be so easy to follow and would also offer excellent grasp of the topic. But if you really want to learn ML, this book is certainly sufficient to take care of all the requirements. It is SIMPLY AMAZING compared to some other 'classic texts' that I bought.",1
Nick,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Three Stars,"A mathematically thorough book, but very dense and hard to read in my opinion.",1
Sidhant,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),"Great Insights, but a hard read","This new book by Chris Bishop covers most areas of pattern recognition quite exhaustively. The author is an expert, this is evidenced by the excellent insights he gives into the complex math behind the machine learning algorithms. I have worked for quite some time with neural networks and have had coursework in linear algebra, probability and regression analysis, and found some of the stuff in the book quite illuminating.

But that said, I must point out that the book is very math heavy. Inspite of my considerable background in the area of neural networks and statistics, I still was struggling with the equations. This is certainly not the book that can teach one things from the ground up, and thats why I would give it only 3 stars. I am new to kernels, and I am finding the relevant chapters difficult and confusing. This book wont be very useful if all you want to do is write machine learning code. The intended audience for this book I guess are PhD students/researchers who are working with the math related aspects of machine learning. Undergraduates or people with little exposure to machine learning will have a hard time with this book. But that said, time spent in struggling with the contents of this book will certainly pay-off, not instantly though.",208
John E,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),The book should change its title,"This book (PRML) should be re-titled as ""PRML: a bayesian approach"". Yes, bayesian approach is very useful for machine learning, and sometimes the final goal of learning is to maximize some sort of posterior probability. However, if the author is such a huge fun of bayes statistics, please tell perspective readers in a clear way. Emphasize bayes aspects too much really hurt the quality of this book as a general-purpose textbook of machine learning.

For a better textbook of machine learning, I recommend:
1) The elements of statistical learning (perhaps this book a little hard for beginner in this field -- but as least better than PRML -- you can compare their chapters about linear regression to see which one is better).
2) Pattern classification (focus on classification, not regression. Also not very easy -- anyway, machine learning is not an easy field ^_^).
3) Machine Learning (a little old, but great for beginner.)

These three book also mention bayesian statistics, but in a proper way. If you have some experience in machine learning and have engineering-level math background, just choose the 1) or 2). If you are completely a beginner, first take a glance on 3), and then go to 1) or 2).

Finally, if you want a book that discusses machine learning purely from bayesian perspective, PRML is good.",58
Scott Davies,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),If only all textbooks were this well-written,"I was a big fan of Bishop's earlier ""Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition"" despite my not being particularly interested in neural networks (as opposed to other aspects of machine learning), and so I was pretty excited when I heard about this book. Reading it has not left me disappointed. Like his earlier book, this text is quite mathematically oriented, and not well-suited for people who aren't comfortable with calculus. However, also like in ""NNPR"", the writing style here is very clear, and everything past basic calculus and linear algebra is well-explained before it's needed. The appendices alone are a goldmine. (Appendix B is a great ""cheat sheet"" for commonly used probability distributions; Appendix C has lots of useful matrix properties you may have forgotten or never known; Appendix D quickly explains what you need to know about the calculus of variations; and Appendix E does the same for Lagrange multipliers.) The author also does an excellent job throughout the text of marrying math and intuition without giving either short shrift.

However, note that the material covered is inherently pretty complex, so the book can still be intimidating in parts despite the excellent writing. It's more appropriate for, say, Ph.D. students and professional researchers in statistics or machine learning than people who just want to crank out code for a simple classifier. There is very little pseudocode (although copious MATLAB code will supposedly be made available in a companion book due out in 2008), and the book's overall approach to machine learning is basically hard-core Bayesian statistics. If you are not willing to scratch your head for a while over lots and lots of equations, this may not be the book for you.

On the flip side, people who are already experts in machine learning may be mildly disappointed with the lack of coverage some of their pet topics get. For example, while the chapter on graphical models is excellent as far as it goes, it only mentions the problem of learning graphical model structures (one of my areas of interest) in passing. Reinforcement learning (another personal area of interest) is discussed briefly in the introduction and then written off as beyond the scope of the book.

However, the book is already a fabulous resource as it stands; complaining there's not even more of it would be gauche. The cover may look like goat barf, and there are some innocuous missing words here and there (hey, it's a first edition), but if you're serious about machine learning and not afraid of a little math, you should definitely own this book. I can only imagine how much cooler my own thesis research might have been if this book had been around a few years earlier.",28
Wu Zheng,2.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),"disappointed, cover a lot but few is explained enough","Not easy for a student with no experience on Machine Learning before. It might be useful for those researchers who have seen a lot. Many ""straightfoward"" or ""easy to show"" questions are not easy for me at a first glance. Many discussions are left to numerous papers, which does not make problem more clear but more puzzled. Many many comments are made in a very high level without detailed explanation. Most exercises are only algebra and matrix theory, nothing to do with Algorithm. I have to read other books first.",17
A guy from nowhere,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),"This is a decent book, but it is a hard read","This is quite a decent book (with respect to coverage), but it went too far in keeping the notation uncluttered.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Probably the best book for machine learning,"I am a PhD student in machine learning. Bishop is really gifted and he explains very well basic and advanced concepts of machine learning. I would say that this book is much more comprehensive than Hastie's Statistical learning book The Elements of Statistical Learning. Very good illustrations and very complete. I would definitely recommend it for those who want to learn statistical/machine learning on their own. The only thing that I don't like is that it often tries to present theories under a probabilistic framework. My personal opinion is that Probabilities is a nice way to present easy theories in a super complex way. I tend to think in a more linear algebra/optimization framework. After so many years in Academia probabilities still confuse me. Hopefully the author doesn't use only the probabilistic framework, that is why I like it",5

LH,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Obfuscates things rather than explaining them,"As a professor who have taught machine learning at the graduate level, I found this book one of the worst ever written for machine learning.

Put simply, it obfuscates things rather than explaining them. It made machine learning look unnecessarily complicated, and yet ugly.

Extremely wordy, and lacks organization.

There is too much ""boring"" equations and not enough ""cool math"" (geometric intuitions). And while most people found it too ""theoretical"", I found it not solid in theory at all. Some important theoretical topics are left out, such as perceptron convergence proof (which can be explained very easily using geometric terms) and theory behind KKT conditions (which also can be explained geometrically).

Also there is an almost ""religious"" tendency towards Bayesian, and almost every chapter ends with Bayesian. While bayesian is very useful in some subfields of machine learning, it is not a universal magic across all machine learning.

Definitely not a textbook for beginners or a university-level class.",20
Herman Redelinghuys,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Poor print quality,"Positive: I received the book in amazingly quick time and the content of the author is very good.

Zac,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Another book about machine learning without a clear theoretical backbone.,"Bishop's book about machine learing and pattern recognition is well written and the figures are really pretty because they are in color and informative. Overall the book looks very nice and it is fun to read in. In my opinion only the book 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' by Hastie et al. looks comparably well.

The book is a textbook rather than a monograph and, hence, intended for students rather than researchers and the coverage of machine learning topics is thorough without being able to cover every topic in deepth. This is not really a draw back because no book is able to do this anyway. The presentation of the methods is informative and, depending on the background of the reader, clear enough to figure out how it works to use the method.

What is the problem: I do not like that the methods are introduced not rigourously but by examples. That mean Bishop does not have the definiton, theorem, proof style but is more heuristic. This may sound very helpful for the reader not familiar with the topic to reduce the barrier of understanding by providing examples to visulalize the problem. The problem is, in my opinion, that this is not the case but the oposite. In think it is never wrong to provide examples and it is absolutely desirable but after the examples are given and one has an intuitive understanding of the problem one wants to see its formal solution because that's what machine learning is about, it is applied statistics. For this reason I give only 4 instead of 5 points (but not less because also all the other books about this topic fail in this respect).

Overall, the book is well done and certainly a good source of information for students and researches.",32
Byung Gyu Ahn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),one of the best books in the field,"this book is one of the best books in the field--machine learning. this is the textbook that is used in most of the renowned university, and it qualifies for it! the contents are abundant, and full explanation and exercises will lead you into the field.",2
shanusmagnus,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Don't buy this if you don't already know everything about the field,"It's hard to figure out who would actually benefit from this book - it amounts to seven hundred pages of equations interrupted by blocks of text that fail to provide any intuition whatever for the techniques they are describing, and the occasional graph which is remarkable in the universe of graphs as being scarcely more informative than the equations it is meant to illustrate.

Seriously, you have to wonder wtf Bishop thought he was doing here. As a catalog of equations for people who already thoroughly understand the learning algorithms I suppose the book can be considered adequate. For any didactic purpose you're wasting your time - you can find dense, technically correct but incomprehensible descriptions for any of these methods online, for free. A textbook ought to aspire to more - should bring some order to the chaos, re-tell a technical story in a new light to make it more sensible and intuitive. This book is so bad in these regards that it makes me angry.

On a related note, I can't believe that Duda and Hart is still the best machine learning / pattern rec. book on the market after thirty years or whatever. This field is dying for a book by someone with even an INKLING of how to teach, or at least willing to make an effort to try.",61
Niharika,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),For MATH BUFF's,This book has the simple math represented so complexly with annoying notations!!. It has lot of Bayesian and Gaussian math rather than the concepts of PR. It is hard to read and understand. It is a better text book for Statics Dept than CS dept.,9
dc,2.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),Thorough but vastly unclear,"I can appreciate others who might think that this is a great book.... but I am a student using it and I have some very different opinions of it.

First, although Mr. Bishop is clearly an expert in Machine Learning, he is also obviously a HUGE fan of Bayesian Statistics. The title of the book is misleading as it makes no mention of Bayes at all but EVERY CHAPTER ends with how all of the chapter's contents are combined in a Bayes method. That's not bad it's just not clear from the title. The title should be appended with ""... using Bayesian Methods""

Second, while it is certainly a textbook, the author clearly has an understanding of the material that seems to undermine his ability to explain it. Though there are mentions of examples there are, in fact, none. There are many graphics and tiny, trivial indicators, but I can't help to think that every single one of the concepts in the book would have benefited from even a single application. There aren't any. I am lead to believe that if you are already aware of many of the methods and techniques that this would be an excellent reference or refresher. As a student starting out I almost always have no idea what his intentions are.

To make matter worse, he occasionally uses symbols that are flat-out confusing. Why would you use PI for anything other than Pi or Product? He does. Why use little k, Capital K, and Greek Letter Kappa (a K!) in a series of explanations. He does. He even references articles that he has written... in 2008!!

Every chapter seems to be an exercise to see how many equations he can stuff in it. There are 300 in Chapter 2 alone. Over and over and over again I have the feeling that he is trying to TELL me how to ride a bicycle when it would have been so much easier to at least let me see the view from behind the handle bars with my feet on the pedals. Chapter five on Neural Nets, for example, is abysmally over-complicated. Would you hand someone a dictionary and ask them to write a poem? (""Hey, all the words you need are in here!"") Of course not.

Third, the book mentions that there is a lot of information available on the web site. The only info available on his website is a brief overview of the text, a detailed overview of the text (that's not a typo.... he has both), an example chapter, links to where the book can be purchased, and (actually, quite useful for creating slides) an archive of all of the figures available in the book. There are no answers to problems or explorations of any part of the material. The upcoming book might be amazing and exactly what I am looking for but it could be months away and another $50 or so to purchase it. Hardly ideal. How about putting some of that MatLab code on your site? *Something* to crystalize the concepts!

Finally, while the intro indicates this might be a good book for Computer Scientists it would actually make more sense to call it a Math book. More specifically a Statistics book. There are no methods, no algorithms, no bits of pseudo-code, and (again) no applications are in the text. Even examples that actually used hard numbers and/or elements from a real problem and explained would be much appreciated.

Maybe I am being a little critical and perhaps I want for too much but in my mind if you are writing a book with the goal of TEACHING a subject, it would be in your interest to make things clear and illustrative. Instead, the book feels more like a combination of ""I am smart. Just read this!"" and a reference text.",367
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),THIS IS A TEXTBOOK!,"I was expecting that 700+ book will be scientific monograph.

M.R.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition),Close enough to the U.S. Edition for most purposes,"Since this version of the book is for the Indian market, I was a bit worried about the potential differences from the U.S. 3rd edition. But after doing a first-hand comparison, I found a LOT more similarities than differences.

The biggest difference is the absence of the last two chapters. The U.S. edition includes: Chapter 26, ""Philosophical Foundations"", which covers arguments over consciousness in machines and the possibility of robot uprisings; and Chapter 27, ""AI: The Present and Future"", which *briefly* describes some things AI researchers need to work on before we can build a ""general-purpose intelligent agent"" (a.k.a. one single AI that will be good enough at a lot of different tasks). These two chapters are interesting, but I wouldn't call them core material, so I'm not surprised they got left out.

Other than that, the differences are astonishingly minor. The chapters are unnumbered, and some of them swapped places for no reason, but all the content from chapters 1 through 25 is here, plus the two appendixes. The ONLY edits to the text are removals of cross-chapter references. The U.S. version will say something like, ""When we discussed whatzits in Chapter 4, we mentioned that they come in two flavors, X and Y"", while the same line in this book will say, ""Whatzits come in two flavors, X and Y"". Again, those are the ONLY edits. All the other sentences are the same. The equations are the same. The diagrams are the same. The exercises at the end of each chapter are the same.

In short, if you can do without those last two chapters, buy this version and save your money.",36
Sean Walker,2.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition),"Great book, terrible Kindle conversion","This is an excellent book however I cannot recommend purchasing the Kindle version of this text. It is atrocious. There are subject headings inserted after the subject is spoken about and, quite often, many heading stacked up on top of each other taking up almost an entire page with useless titles that are in the wrong order anyway. There are no page numbers, which is unacceptable for a text that is used by many college AI programs across the country. There are tons of hyphenation errors. The delineations between figure notes and the text are almost imperceptible so it is difficult to tell what text goes where. In general it is difficult to read and navigate due to this horrible Kindle conversion.",141
Tristan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition),"Good book, but the Kindle version still needs some work.","As a textbook, it's fine. It covers a wide range of concepts and topics in the field of artificial intelligence and is a good resource to have around.
My rating is mainly based on the state of the Kindle version. There are some issues I have with it that keep me from enjoying it further.

The biggest problem is the overall format. Pages aren't just digital versions of the physical pages in the real book. They're broken up into thousands of screenshot-like segments. You can't scroll ""up to the top of a page"" or ""down to the bottom"" because each page segment is only as big as your screen. This would be fine if it were a much smaller book. My tablet counts 33,261 page segments when I use it, so you can see how this might be cumbersome for such a large book.

The effect of the above problem could be reduced a bit if the table of contents were complete. As it is, the table of contents is very limited in what section it allows you to ""jump"" to. The book is broken up into sections, each of which is covered in a number of chapters, as one might expect. But unfortunately, the Kindle version only lets you jump to the first chapter of each section, not any chapter in the book. This means that you either have to swipe through hundreds of page segments to get to the spot you want, or you can use the slider at the bottom of the screen and hope you land near where you want to be (the slider won't give you any additional info about where you are, either). I suppose you could swipe through it ahead of time and place book marks at each chapter header, but that shouldn't be something a reader has to do to navigate a book by its own chapters.

The only other things I can think to mention have to do with resizing the screen. It's not very smooth at all. In fact, there is usually a noticeable delay when you try to resize a page segment, probably because it has to re-calculate all the page segments to fit the new zoom scale. I'm sure this could be improved if each page were just a digital version of its physical counterpart. The other problem is that the images in the book do not resize with the text. This is an especially troublesome problem for this particular book, since there are a number of intricate diagrams and images of pseudo code algorithms that are very difficult to read at this size. I can't even read some of them, and my tablet screen is larger than 10 inches.

This is actually the second Kindle book I've purchased. The first one (Introduction to the Theory of Computation, by Michael Sipser) was near flawless. Each page was a digital representation of its physical counterpart, the table of contents was complete, and resizing was very smooth. I bought this AI book in Kindle form hoping for a similar experience, but I guess not all the kinks have been worked out yet. It honestly comes off feeling like a beta version that isn't quite finished. But given my experience with that other Kindle book, I know improvements can be made to this one.

All that being said, I can still use the Kindle version of this book. It's just very inconvenient. If you're looking to acquire this book, I'd recommend going with the physical version, for the time being. Yeah, it's another large textbook to haul around. But it will be a lot easier to navigate and use.",4
Ashwin Kapur,5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition),Fantastic Book: Horrendous Kindle Conversion,"This is the best introductory review to Artificial Intelligence on the market. It's very well written and organized. There are other books that are better for focusing on one particular aspect of AI, but as a general book this is the best I've seen. If you are looking for a really good introductory textbook to AI that does not completely dumb things down, buy this book.

Most of the negative comments about this book come from people stating that it's not a big enough update from the prior edition. While it's true that the entire field of AI has not been completely updated since the last edition, it's also not the case that this book comes out with new editions with the frequency of some Calculus or Economics textbooks where new editions seem to come out purely to ensure students can't buy a used book for the course. The updates are substantial. Whether the new edition gives you enough extra to want to buy it if you own the old edition is a decision only you can make for yourself after spending some time at the website for the book aima.cs.uberkeley.edu.

The Kindle conversion of this book is absolutely horrendous. I prefer to buy electronic copies of books if possible so I don't have to carry a heavy hard copy around since I often read while commuting. I would not recommend that for this book, even though at a 1000+ textbook sized pages, it is a pretty substantial book. Fortunately a friend of mine had bought a Kindle copy of the book and I was able to see how bad it was and I bought the hard copy.

I recently got an email telling me Amazon was sending out an updated version of the Kindle version of Steve Job's biography because the conversion hadn't been done properly. They really need to do that for this book. Once done it may be a good idea to state on the website that the Kindle conversion has been fixed.",12

Most of them were disappointing--the language was stilted, the explanations were very formal and required long explanatory chapters on Turing machines to be understandable, and worst of all, they were outdated--some of them were written years before Deep Blue. I purchased this book for a university class on AI and loved it from the minute I opened it. It's very readable, includes both formal and informal explanations of most topics, and is about as up to date as a textbook like this can be. It feels as though it were written for modern readers like me, who prefer to get an intuitive grasp on something before diving in to the formal development. Like all textbooks, it's expensive, but worth it if you're interested in AI. I plan to keep it after my class is over.",3

While the book doesn't go in depth in any of the the major topics -- there are whole books dedicated to each (NLP, probabilistic models, machine learning, computer vision, etc.) -- it's enough to grasp what those topics are about. At the end of each chapter it provides a very interesting and entertaining discussion of the current state of the art.",5

G. Sarria,4.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition),Not big changes but still good,"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern approach is a very good book which explores concepts in the area of AI. It covers most of the techniques in the area (there are some important AI techniques missing such as KDD and Data Mining), however it doesn't go deep in any concept so if you're looking for a specialized reference this is not the one.

The third edition of this book offers a few changes:
- a very updated list of references
- some (not many) new exercises
- they rewrote concepts in order to be up-to-date with the state of the art
- they changed the order of some chapters

All in all, it is still a very good introductory book, it is well-written and very easy to understand. If you are new in the field this is the first textbook to read.",75

The book is well written and very comprehensive. It does not go into great detail with the various topics in AI, but it does give a very thorough overview of methods being used. It appears to be very up-to-date with the subject matter. Also, it is not programming language specific, which was great for me because my java and C are a bit rusty.

D E Bodette,4.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition),Intro to AI online course text,"This was purchased as a companion text to the Stanford Into to AI online class taught by the authors. The text is a great complement to the class. The class works through a lot of examples and clarifications on how to apply concepts. The book provides the formal definitions, a lot more words and depth to the material covered in the classroom.

The book covers a lot of ground even for ~1000 pages. The book does a great job of maintaining a uniform level of detail. The class does a better job of ordering the material than the text. Fortunately, the text is well written without accumulating a lot of jargon, such that you can skip around from one chapter and topic to the next in order to follow the classroom lectures without getting lost in jargon.

If you are taking the class, get the book. If you are new to AI and trying to wade through this book, definitely sign up for the class.",4

Of course, a lot of this is space constraints, but better online support might help there, and if you're teaching, make sure to provide a few examples - doing the same problem over and over again to see if they 'get it' leads to lots of students who think they can solve problems they really can't.",2

Lioncubg,5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition),A must for anyone learning to program,"This is by far one of the best books i have ever read. For many years i have struggled with abtuse books on algorithms, programming languages and mathematics. This book is unlike anything i have read before. For the last 20 years, I as a lay person, who has not taken any university classes in AI and programming have had problems moving passed certain levels of complexity in my understanding. Simple things like decision tress and recursion had eluded me in the many books i read, seeming intangible in the areas where they would interface to the real world. Reading the explanations in this book i have finally got it. These authors through scenarios, explanations and code (replicated in many languages on the companion website) explain decision based structures and there use in agent design ,assuming very little along the way, outside of an elementary understanding of programming and logic, thus not losing me the reader. They gave me the building blocks and showed me how and why i would want to assemble them.
The code in this book is both beautiful, elegant and succinct all at the same time. The hours of exploration and learning i got from these samples alone were worth the price of the book.
If you are learning to program -- Read this book.
If you interested in decision and value based reasoning -- Read this book.
This is not a short book, but it is well worth the time investment. I plan on having it done within the year. I have learned so much about what i realize i knew so little of before, but I am so much more capable now than i ever was before, and that is because of this book.",10

anonymous coward,1.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition),Kindle edition very poorly done,"I like this book, but the kindle edition is full of weird artifacts. This has rendered many in-line mathematical formulas largely unintelligible. For an example, every logical expression for ""x and y"", where the ""and"" should be a wedge, has instead been converted into a caret, which in every case is floating almost directly over the first variable. In another example, there is a reference to the ""one-element vector h0.6i."" It seems that the h and i were probably brackets originally, but it is impossible to tell.

In the real book there are words in the left margin that indicate where in the text a word has been first defined. In the kindle edition these are replaced with immense horizontal bands across the entire page with horizontal rules above and below, taking up three full rows of text, and they appear below the text that they refer to. Three of those in one paragraph, and you're lucky to even get the paragraph on the same screen with them, much less use them as a nice guide to where words are defined. All practical use they had in the real book is completely obliterated, and now they just take up a lot of room on the screen and make the book harder to read.

In the few places where they've kept the original formulas by means of images, the images look a little like they came from a malfunctioning copier. This is less of a problem than the other issues, but it is still annoying.

It also emphasize a few common principals: overfit, curse of dimensionality, explore and exploitation, structure learning and parameters learning, etc. The author is very good at explaining in a few simple sentences the gist of an advance algorithm e.g. TD(lambda) and value function approximation in reinforcement learning, message passing, MCMC and Kalman filtering in bayesian, etc.

I have read a few textbooks on machine learning (intro to Statistical Learning by Hastie etc) and so I would say that my knowledge of ML is at the ""textbook overview"" level. Since I am not a ML practitioner, I may not be the best judge of a book such as this one, it was a fairly difficult read, and I know I need to read the book a second time to get an even greater appreciation and understanding of the concepts covered by the author. That being said, it was a very enjoyable book. The book was very different from any ML book that I've read or checked out either at a bookstore or online. I think one needs to have some knowledge of ML to appreciate the book - concepts like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, Bayesian inference, support vector machines, neural networks, etc ....

On one side, the book explains the five schools of thought to machine learning and does with great detail. On the other hand, after starting off with an adequate level (from my view anyway, I hold a masters degree in telecom engineering) it became more and more obscure, to the point where I found myself skipping some of the explanations in the last chapters hoping to come to the end where the author would recap and resume it all in clearer terms. I guess the matter is complex enough that requires careful reading, meaning re-reading chapters two, three times and often coming back to where you started to feel lost. That's my only critique and considering it may be my lack of energy to do this, I think it well deserves four stars.
The author definitely gained me back at the last chapter, a good resume of what AI and machine learning means, what isn't and what holds for the future.

A. Menon,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,Good overview of machine learning techniques for non-expert but overall a mixed book,"The Master Algorithm is a reasonable overview of the growing field of machine learning. The author explores the idea of there being a master algorithm which could explain everything given enough data. The idea seems a bit over the top when initially phrased but the real purpose of the book is to introduce ideas used in machine learning and how they work and are used to solve problems.

The book is split into multiple chapters which start from discussing abstractly the master algorithm and then move on to some of the philosophical issues associated with using such algorithms. In particular the author discusses at the core of believing in pattern recognition algorithms is belief in inductive reasoning. The author discusses human learning and gets into some neuroscience and how neural networks are constructed. The reader gets a vague sense of Hebbian learning and how neuron weighting are at the core of neural networks. The author spends a lot of time discussing various approaches in machine learning and gives the reader an intuitive feel of Bayesian learning. The author was an originator in a particular algorithm called naïve Bayes which greatly simplified solutions to certain problems and so the author introduces his ideas to the reader. Other machine learning ideas are introduced like genetic programming and multivariable regression. The author also discusses other machine learning algorithms which turn data into a vector and then look for close neighbors of the vector to classify the input. The author also spends some time on how unsupervised learning would look. The book combines computer science ideas and intuition and tries to use a fictitious robot as the means to convey ideas about how a computer would learn. The author finally introduces his own master algorithm called alchemy which combines most of the models described in the book. The reader really gets little actual sense of what's going on in the algorithm as the author qualifies one needs a PhD in computer science.

The Master Algorithm is the first book I have seen which introduces some of the ideas being used in machine learning to a general audience. It does so quite well and most of the ideas are absorbable. At the same time there are a few too many instances where the author is self promoting talking about all of the brilliant ideas he has had which have reshaped the field and how other areas of AI research of the past or Kurzweil and his singularity concept are idiotic. Despite probably being right in much of his analysis its arguing with no one on the other side and unproductive. Also the flavor of the writing is odd - it turns into some fantasy literature at times as though that makes the subject more digestible and in fact makes it more irritating.

I'd say that for starters, if you're expecting this book to provide you with a sense of technical understanding on the vast scope of topics covered within, you're misinterpreting the intention. Rather, Pedro Domingos takes you on a journey throughout the history surrounding attempts at cracking the master algorithm. He presents useful and concise interpretations of the different learning tribes (Connectionists, Symbolists, etc.); noting their respective successes and failures. More notably, he concocts his own attempt at the master algorithm, an effort that by no means could be described anything less than luminary. That's the essence of this book in my eyes, to serve as an approachable starting point to understand the fundamentals surrounding a universal learner, and how not to repeat the transgressions of our past so as to eventually instantiate progress.",4

Denny,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,Okay Read for people in Machine Learning,"I'm giving this book 4 starts because it was entertaining read (especially the last chapter), and and because I found a few neat nuggets of knowledge about the connections between various Machine Learning concepts.

My issues with this book are:

1. It is not clear who the target audience is. It seems like this book is written for everyone and no one. As someone with a background in Machine Learning I would have preferred a few succinct formulas over paragraphs of explanation. For someone without any background in ML on the other hand the explanations won't make a lot of sense - they are full of technical jargon.

2. The book is clearly biased towards the author's own point of view and work. Of course that's unavoidable when you're writing a book, but you should at least let your readers know about it. The book is written/marketed as if it represents hard truths, not personal opinions.

3. For the topics I was intimately familiar with I found that the authors skims of a lot details and/or doesn't consider developments that address the problems he describes. I also found a few minor mistakes (no major ones). This makes me very skeptical about the sections on topics I am NOT familiar with, which are probably of similar depth.",3
Avery Magill,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,Four Stars,"Great information, though it can be repetitive at times",1
Claude Forthomme (Nougat),5.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,A Must Read for Anyone Interested in What Our Digital Future Looks Like,"A word of warning: I'm not a machine learning practitioner and not even mathematically inclined. I am merely an average person with a (reasonable) degree of culture (I suppose I classify as a sociologist) looking out to understand the world around me a little better.

Yet I loved this book, it opened my eyes on a world I suspected existed somewhere in the depths of my computer or when I did a Google search but that I never understood. If you are afraid to be engulfed in equations, don't be. The author prefers to use allegories and is very good at giving simple explanations, making everything (almost) crystal clear.

What you get is a comprehensive overview of where machine learning is going. This is hugely important, considering the sometimes disturbing news you get in the media - not just from Snowden but also from ""neurotechnologists"" who guide political campaigns by embedding cameras in ads, cameras that detect the viewers' reactions and then adjust the campaign in function of these reactions.

Perhaps my only quarrel with this book - but it does not detract from its excellence and the five stars I gave it - is the philosophical position taken by the author. I don't quite share his optimism about our robotic future. And this for 2 reasons:

One, the connection between learning algorithms and data. Domingos does note at the outset: ""...the more data they [the learners] have, the more intricate the algorithms can be."" So without ""big data"", you don't get ""good"" learning algorithms - the ""bigger"" the data, the better the algorithm. Or as Domingos writes, ""the more data we have, the more we can learn"". True enough. But what about the quality and size of the big data? What if the data is error-filled and we're not aware of it? Can machine learning be aware of something their human masters are not? On what basis? The algorithms are taught to deal with an imperfect world and draw the most likely conclusions, where ""most likely"" is highly subjective. Or at least, it is ""highly subjective"" in my opinion and I realize that it is only one opinion and not necessarily one shared by the author.

Two, the connection between you as you are and an expanded ""digital you"": a ""model"" of who you are, your work experience, your tastes, a model that the algorithm has learned - and thanks to algorithms, you will be able to do more things and faster than ever before. Domingos describes an extraordinary future where, for example, in your LinkedIn account, ""you'll immediately interview for every job in the universe that remotely fits your parameters (profession, location, pay, etc) LinkedIn will respond on the spot with a ranked list of the best prospects, and out of those, you'll pick the first company that you want to have a chat with. Same with dating: your model will go on millions of dates so you don't have to...""

Big time-saver obviously. But it comes at a cost: you have to give your parameters (stuff about your work, your likes and dislikes) to the algorithms. Ye who go digital, leave behind any notion of privacy...So users of this algorithmic landscape will have few shaded areas in which to hide.

But for me, privacy concerns aside (and I'm not that concerned, I have nothing to hide), there is yet another matter that I find more worrisome. Domingos (on p.283) tells us he is confident that the future can only get better: ""In fact, it's the systems that have a slight edge in serving us better that will, generation after generation, multiply and take over the gene pool."" Then he adds: ""Of course, if we're so foolish as to deliberately program a computer to put itself above us, then maybe we'll get what we deserve"".

Indeed. That is precisely my worry: can we be sure that there won't be a Doctor Evil who will do so? Can we be sure that there won't be an Apprentice Sorcerer who might end up doing this even if unintentionally? A mistake can happen...

So yes, I'm deeply worried about this algorithmic future and I don't share the author's unflagging optimism. But that doesn't mean it's a book you shouldn't read. On the contrary, it's a must read precisely because it raises all these fundamental questions about the future of humanity. And it is an easy read even for the non-cognoscenti like myself, I highly recommend the introductory chapters, and if you get bogged down in the middle with all the technicalities, no fear, skip to the last two chapters, they are well worth reading!",2

Aside from a few specifics regarding initial set-up, I hardly read anything that Jim hadn't said or that didn't seem intuitively obvious. The exception was comments regarding the remote control that Jim didn't mention. (Apparently it no longer ships with the Echo; I am not certain about this, but didn't see it mentioned in Amazon's ad.) I suggest that you get the device first, set it up, and then decide whether or not you need to download this or another book.",3

As far back as twenty years ago, we wouldnt even have fathom the idea that we would have wireless Cellular phones, and tablets that serve as multifunctional notebooks/diary/daily agenda, etc. The ironic twist in all of this technological vanguardism is that, the more we become an interactive society, the more aislated we are as human beings. Thats where the Amazon Echo comes in!: Your interactive personal assistant! this device, humanly referred to as Alexa, is basically a smart speaker, that will interact with the host within reasonable logic. I got the User's Guide to Alexa on a promotion from my local book store, and when i began reading it, i was intrigued by the purpose and ingenuity behind this artifact, that will soon become another accesory to our insatiable desire to obtain the next technological perk.",2

michibilly,3.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Echo: Master Your Amazon Echo; User Guide and Manual,"Growing pains, but still fun and somewhat useful","We were very excited to get this during one of the pre-Xmas sales and started using it immediately. It connected to our home wi-fi flawlessly, and the setup for my laptop and phone was just as easy. We love the music feature but many of our Tunes were bought from iTunes and are not compatible. (We are searching for software to convert those.) The songs it does have are really good and it's amazing how great they sound coming out of something that looks like a Pringles Can. The daily news briefing is nice but only NPR. We got an email telling us that we can also get Huffington Post and CNN but neither has ever worked for us.

New features are added on a fairly regular basis; the features are called Skills, and you can choose from among many of them by going online to the site and browsing and choosing. You also get periodic emails telling you about the new Skills which is great, but we have tried some of them, like the Huffington Post skill several times but it doesn't work for us. I initially saw a CNN skill but it seems to have disappeared; didn't work anyway. Most of the skills don't really interest me, but I still look through them each time I get the email...hey, you never know!

As far as its knowledge base, I have asked it many questions about various topics but about 75% of the time it doesn't know the answer either even when I phase the question multiple ways, which is a little disappointing. On a happier note, asking it to tell you a joke is fun; most of the jokes are corny, but some are hilarious. I have asked it for political jokes about the current gaggle of Presidential candidates, but only a few seem to be working correctly, or have jokes available.

One of the skills that I use a lot is the Shopping List skill. Those at home can tell it to add something to the shopping list, and before I leave work I can bring the list up and pick up things on my way home. When I'm home I can compose the shopping list by perusing the cabinets and telling Echo what to add to the list; very handy.

Although the Echo has some practical applications, I still see it as an interesting toy, but I think over time as new skills emerge I will find it more useful.",7

I had no idea what Amazon Echo was before I read this book. I simply got it out of curiosity. If you're like me and don't know about Echo, this device is somewhat similar to Siri, but it does more than that. It's a voice control tool, that can help you with a lot of different tasks.

MysterEO,2.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Echo: Master Your Amazon Echo; User Guide and Manual,"An instruction advertisement, does not have a F.A.Q.","Today is the first time I heard about the Amazon Echo. So what is it? It is a ""personal assistant"" for the home... similar to ""Siri"" on the Apple, but this is Amazon's answer to Siri... o.k.... but this leaves many questions unanswered... Is this also a high quality speaker to listen to music or radio? Does it only speak English, or does it also speak Russian, Spanish, Japanese, French, etc. Is it only for the United States, as are many things Amazon. It costs $200, or $150 if you have Amazon Prime, but Amazon Prime is only worth having if you are physically inside the U.S. because you cannot get video streaming outside the U.S.A. And who wrote this book? The author's name does not appear in the book, although I can see it in the ad for the book. Andrew McKinnon must be an Amazon employee or he was paid to write this User Manual, because he only has nice things to say about the Amazon Echo. (eg, ""Alexa is more personable than Siri"" (?)

Maybe the use of more bullet points and even illustrations of the device and the app would have been more helpful.

I bought this book before my Echo arrived, so it was helpful in knowing what to expect. However, as I said above, it's set up made it difficult to go back and look things up after my Echo arrived and I was getting to know the device and app. I kind of wish I would have bought a different book.

Mark,1.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Echo: Master Your Amazon Echo; User Guide and Manual,Embarrassingly bad,"It's revealing that the 5-star reviews all sound like this book -- simpleminded, insincerely upbeat, way more enthusiastic than is justified, and just plain cringeworthy. The book is written with a tone you'd expect from a octagenarian who's still overwhelmed by the magic of, say, telephony or automobiles or indoor plumbing, but who's had a tad too much caffeine. The relentlessly happyfaced language is condescending to the point of being offensive. and there's enough of it on every page to make you cringe. To call this ""promotional"" material, as some here have, is an insult to promotional material.

About content: I held my nose & read more than halfway through before coming to *one* piece of information I didn't already know -- that you can apparently change the Echo's wake word to a third option (Simon), although that doesn't seem enabled on ours, so maybe it's coming or a regional thing. Nothing else in the entire book qualifies as instructions for the ""mastery"" implied in the title, and I'm frankly appalled at that misrepresentation.",18

Added 7/12/2015: I wish I could give it negative three stars. Finally finished it last night with huge sigh of relief. Indeed it did not teach me a single thing other than what an awful writer the author is. It did say things that were quite false.

That was really the only thing I did not know about Echo. However, the author never mentioned if this third name had a male voice to go along with the male name. The author also explained that Echo can keep a shopping list and a to do list. I have never done that but would like to start doing so. I don't recall reading anywhere what commands you would issue to Echo to do so.

Anyone ordering an actual Echo already knows 95% of what is presented in this ""book"" merely from looking at the Echo item page on Amazon. It claims to be a 2016 updated version, but it falsely claims it is packaged with the remote (which costs extra and is currently out of stock as of the date of this review), has no mention of controlling home automation, it mentions the ""echo pen"" that records 800 hours of audio, but there is no connectivity between the ""echo pen"" and the echo - see for yourself by searching amazon for ""echo pen"" - the item page for the ""Echo Pen"" doesn't itself even mention the Amazon Echo which the pen would surely tout highly if there was some type of connection between the two. There is not a single picture other than the cover. It does have 7 pages of cutsie kitchy sayings you can say to or ask Alexa to get some type of novel or trivially cutsie response, which for me is not at all why I've paid $180 for my Echo, and anyone who's tried Siri for more than two minutes has probably become bored of. If I could rate this ""guide"" zero stars, I would. I naively thought this updated ""2016"" edition would be different from the poorly reviewed original edition, and not that I have the earlier one for comparison - but it appears there is nothing actually updated and has numerous references to the early 2015 Echo, like how prime members can get it for a huge discount but they have to be invited. Hello May 2015!!! I absolutely regret buying this users guide and am marveled on how such a useless book has probably made its ""author"" a million dollars. Buyer beware!! I'm actually contemplating writing a detailed, photographed, indexed book that is still easy to read just to make the point that this book is garbage.

This is mostly just a basic operators manual, and in fairness that's what is says on the cover. I was just hoping for more particularly in the area of setting up a smart home. This book just points out that you can do it, but it doesn't really get into the details of how to set up one. If you are looking for something that goes in depth and ""gets under the hood"" this book is not for you.

Evan Miller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight,"Insightful, practical, and colorful. Perspective from a biased reviewer.","Disclaimer: I served as a paid technical editor for Data Smart. I am not affiliated with the publisher, but I did receive a small fee for double-checking the book's mathematical content before it went to press. I also went to elementary school with the author. So as you read the rest of the review, keep in mind that this reviewer's judgment could be clouded by my lifelong allegiance to Lookout Mountain Elementary School, as well as the Scarface-esque pile of one dollar bills currently sitting on my kitchen table.

Anyway, books about ""Data"" seem to fit into one of the following categories:

* Extremely technical gradate-level mathematics books with lots of Greek letters and summation signs

* Pie-in-the-sky business bestsellers about how ""Data"" is going to revolutionize the world as we know it. (I call these ""Moneyball"" books)

* Technical books about the hottest new ""Big Data"" technology such as R and Hadoop

Data Smart is none of these. Unlike ""Moneyball"" books, Data Smart contains enough practical information to actually start performing analyses. Unlike most textbooks, it doesn't get bogged down in mathematical notation. And unlike books about R or the distributed data blah-blah du jour, all the examples use good old Microsoft Excel. It's geared toward competent analysts who are comfortable with Excel and aren't afraid of thinking about problems in a mathematical way. It's goal isn't to ""revolutionize"" your business with million-dollar software, but rather to make incremental improvements to processes with accessible analytic techniques.

I don't work at a big company, so I can't attest to the number of dollars your company will save by applying the book's methods. But I can attest that the author makes difficult mathematical concepts accessible with his quirky sense of humor and gift for metaphor. For example, I previously had not been exposed to the nitty-gritty of clustering techniques. After a couple of hours with the clustering chapters, which include illuminating diagrams and spreadsheet formulas, I felt like I had a good handle on the concepts, and would feel comfortable implementing the ideas in Excel -- or any other language, for that matter.

What I like most about the book is that it doesn't try to wave a magic data wand to cure all of your company's ills. Instead it focuses on a few areas where data and analytic techniques can deliver a concrete benefit, and gives you just enough to get started. In particular:

* Optimization techniques (Ch. 4) can systematically reduce the cost of manufacturing inputs

* Clustering techniques (Ch. 2 and 5) can deliver insights into customer behavior

* Predictive techniques (Ch. 3, 6, and 7) can increase margins with better predictions of uncertain outcomes

* Forecasting techniques (Ch. 8) can reduce waste with better demand planning

It may take some creativity to figure out how to apply the methods to your own business processes, but all of the techniques are ""tried and true"" in the sense of being widely deployed at large companies with big analytics budgets and teams of Ph.D.'s on staff. This book's contribution is to make these techniques available to anyone with a little background in applied mathematics and a copy of Excel. For that reason, despite the absence of glitter and/or Jack Welch on the book's cover, I think Data Smart is an important business book.

I had a few criticisms of the book as I was reading drafts, but almost all of them were addressed before the final revision. For the sake of completeness, I'll tell you what they were. Some of the chapters ran on a bit long, but these have been split up into manageable pieces. The Optimization chapter is a bit of a doozie, and used to be at the very beginning, but the reader can now ""warm up"" with some easier chapters on clustering and simple Bayesian techniques. The Regression chapter originally didn't discuss Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, which are important for evaluating predictive models visually, but now ROC curves are abundant.

Only one real criticism from me remains: I would have liked to see more on quantile regression, which is only mentioned in passing. It's a great technique for dealing with outlier-heavy data. The book by Koenker has good but highly mathematical coverage, and I would have loved to see this subject given the Foreman treatment. But, you can't have everything, and I suppose John needs to leave some material for Data Smart 2: The Spreadsheet of Doom.

In sum, Data Smart is a well-written and engaging guide to getting new insights from data using familiar tools. The techniques aren't really cutting-edge -- in fact, most have been around for decades -- but to my knowledge this is the first time they've been presented in a way that Excel-slinging business analysts can apply the methods without needing her own team of operations researchers and data scientists. If you're not sure whether the book's sophistication is on par with your own skills, you can download a complete sample chapter (as well as example spreadsheets) from the author's website.

One last thing: unlike many books with a technical bent, the prose is engaging and extremely clear. I think this can be traced to John's childhood. When John misbehaved, his father (who is a professor of English) would punish John by forcing him to read a novel by Charles Dickens. Minor infractions resulted in A Christmas Carol being meted out, and when he was really bad he had to read Great Expectations. This is a true story which you should ask John about if you see him at a book-signing event.",208
Lou Gutnicki,4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight,"Great Book, Lousy References","I would go as far as to say that the book is brilliant.
First, a drop about me from the standpoint of this book. I have been an IT professional for many years specializing in programming, database, and MS Office add-ons. Part of my job entails self enrichment, that is, expand my working knowledge in areas potentially important for my job. I chose Foreman's book to help with this task for a number of reasons: a) Data Science is a hot area and my company does have a Data Science group, b) I have lots of data experience under my belt - I felt that it would be nice for once to get some useful information from the data, and c) I have a really good Excel background - so I figured that Foreman's approach would be perfect for me - little did I know that I would seriously add to my Excel bag of tricks.
The author makes the assumptions that: a) the reader is somewhat technical, b) he knows nothing about Data Science, and c) he is relatively comfortable working in Excel.
Reading the book is a joy because Foreman has a cozy, chummy style. He definitely doesn't throw all the technical stuff at the reader rat-tat-tat machine gun style like many other authors. Instead, Foreman gently introduces his topics and then ramps up technical details carefully. This most definitely helps the learning process.
Speaking of learning, by the end of the you will have learned important concepts in ""machine learning"" and I believe that you will be ready for the next step. I sure was. I found the topics interesting and I wanted to learn more. This is where the book's only problem area comes into play - the next step. Foreman has 3 references - one good, but minor, one terrible, and the other is inappropriate. Let me explain.
Foreman recommends a free resource as a follow-on to his Forecasting Chapter. This is a good reference, but I believe that Forecasting is a minor topic in Data Science, unless, of course, Forecasting becomes your thing.
Foreman's main reference is: ""Data Mining with R"" by Luis Torgo. Foreman recommends this as the next step after his book.I tried to read this several times, but couldn't. It certainly wasn't my next step.
The other reference, ""The Elements of Statistical Learning"" by Trevor Hastie, et. al, is totally inappropriate for Data Science newbies. You can checkout the Amazon reviews for this book and you'll see that you need a pretty serious background in statistics to get anything out of that reference. In fact, the author Hastie says as much in his next book ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning- with Applications in R"". This is the appropriate next step, but I'll get to that in a moment.
Here are my recommendations:
A. Read Foreman's book and follow along with him in working through the Excel spreadsheets. This is a first step in getting comfortable with Machine Learning.
B. Take the Coursera courses: 1) Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach, and 2) Machine Learning: Regression. The courses are free unless you want completion certificates, in which case there is nominal cost.
C. Now you are ready for: An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics) This book is also available for free by the authors - check online.",14
Elliot,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight,The Best Practical Guide to Business Analytics You Can Find,"The best single book on Data Science today. I handle the data analysis and BI for the delivery side of a huge internet-based retail company, and have been a fan of Foreman's since his ""Analytics Made Skeezy"" blog days. His explanations are clear, his examples are to the point, and throughout it all, he is results-oriented. That is an important distinction; if you want theory, if you want to follow the development of algorithms, then attend a lecture by Moses Charikar (actually everyone should attend a Charikar lecture, just for the utter joy of the intellectual insights.) If you want a hands-on, practical guide to the processes involved in Data Science, then Foreman is your guy. Unlike many writers in the field, he is not an ""every problem is a nail"" guru, touting one magic approach to all problems. Neither is he a database guy or business stats guy who recently found it sexier and more lucrative to describe himself as a data scientist. Foreman is the real deal and short of hiring him as a consultant (if he still takes those kinds of jobs now that he's the brains behind the analytics at Mail Chimp) the next best thing you can do is read this book.",7

If you are a manager, work through this book and become a brilliant one. While most of the programming and statistics and analytics and management books I have read are like chewing aluminum foil, this one is straight to the point, easy to navigate, and God dare I say it, even interesting. A. Bartel wrote a 3-star rating because he felt it jumped around. I can see that to a point. This book is a balanced combination of practical highlights and careful navigation of technique. There isn't a lot of transitional philosophical or historical or theoretical material. But for me, that is exactly why I love this book.",7
Michael Matthews,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight,The Perfect Book for Meaningful Data Analysis,"This is an excellent book and incredibly powerful if you're in any sort of field that requires data analysis. I've read many books on the subject of statistical analysis and most seem to fall in the category of:

1.) A very technical ""how-to"" on using Excel/R/whatever to run certain functions but there is a huge assumption that you understand what the data output means. These are more like user manuals for their respective programs.

2.) A more high-level view of stats that is similar to stuff you learned in Statistics 101 but with far less examples and it can be difficult to see how this will apply in your position.

Foreman's book was recommended to me by Chandoo of Excel Guru fame and it is the book I've been searching for to step up my game. He does a great job of breaking down core concepts and introducing new tools(all in Excel!) that I can actually apply to my current position. That being said, there are a couple of caveats...

1.) I would recommend at least 6 months of solid Excel usage under your belt. The author goes over the formulas and you can download the files online, however there is plenty of OFFSET and Array formulas that can be intimidating to more casual users. I highly recommend downloading the files and doing everything from scratch, and then using the author's version as reference when you get stuck.

2.) This is not really a book you can breeze through(and I mean this as a compliment). The core concepts are broken down well but you will need to reread chapters to truly understand how the formulas and underlying concepts fit. I personally read Chapter 2 around 5-6 times so I can grasp k-means clustering and how I can apply it to my current project. I've only been in the data analysis world for a couple of years, so perhaps this is just my noviceness showing.

This is a fantastic book and one I cannot recommend enough. I hope that Foreman continues to expand on this series as I really enjoy his writing style and his ability to confer what's truly important in data science.",14
Gerard Cunningham,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight,"Excellent - clear, involving and thorough - you will learn a lot - highly recommended","I highly recommend John Foreman's book: 'Data Smart - Using Data Science to Transform Data into Insight'. The author's approach is unique - he teaches data science skills without teaching programming. His approach works because he limits the newness of each subject item to one dimension, that being the data science technique at hand. Each skill is introduced in the familiar environment of Excel and its spreadsheets. If the author had introduced a programming language at the same time, the difficulty of staying focused on the technique being taught would have been increased greatly.

Each technique introduced is explained by first posing and then working through a business problem. Each problem has an accompanying Excel dataset. For each challenge, you are soon immersed in data - your Excel skills will be stretched and improved and you will need to work hard to keep abreast of each lesson. It is worthwhile for the reader because tangible learning occurs as the data is worked through and the business challenges are demonstrably solved.

The techniques you will learn include:
Cluster analysis using k-means and k-medians algorithms
Document classification using a Naive Bayes algorithm
Optimization modeling using linear programming methods
Community detection in network graphs using modularity maximization
Linear and logistic regression
Ensemble models based on bagging and boosting techniques
Forecasting based on exponential smoothing with trend and seasonality (ETS)
Outlier detection using k-nearest-neighbors and local outlier factors

In addition to teaching techniques, the author sprinkles the text with conclusions he has formed based on his years of data science practice and on a healthy skepticism for some of the overblown claims made for data science. His advice includes the following:

Beware the poorly posed problem. Data scientists must learn to communicate with stakeholders in order to help frame business problems properly.
You will generally get more benefit by spending time selecting good data and engineering better data features than searching for a marginally better predictive model. A great model cannot deliver good performance with poor data.
Remember, industry is not academia. In industry, analytics is a results-driven pursuit. The best model is the one that strikes a balance between performance and usability. If a model is never used, it is worthless.
Mailchimp, the author's employer, has TB of data under management. However, it neither needs nor uses all this data for analysis and model training. Instead it aggregates its data to the level the business requires. This aggregate dataset is typically 10GB in size. This aggregation enables mailchimp to use R in production.
Data science is not the most important function in the organization. The purpose of the data science function is to serve the business and help it achieve its goals. The purpose of data science is not to build models for their own sake.

The author introduces the R programming language in the final chapter, as a gateway to doing further work in data science. R is very powerful but it can appear to be a black-box tool for solving data analysis problems. As the author explains, R has great performance but it is not great for explaining the inner workings of models.

At the outset, the author explained that he preferred clarity over mathematical correctness when writing the book. He did an excellent job. The aspiring data scientist will learn by doing in the familiar and manageable environment of Excel.",3

I feel like normally, books teach you the algorithms that have been found and leave you to get the hard work of intuiting what's really going on. Foreman takes the opposite approach here, trying to show you what's going on, and demonstrating it with a simple, concrete spreadsheet, but I feel I've really gained an understanding of what's going on here, and there has been so little work on my part, I'm in disbelief.",5
Bryan Jensen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight,A great overview of data science methods using Excel to help one learn,"John Foreman has an entertaining and thorough writing style that makes this a great book for using Excel to think through several essential, basic data inference methods. While Excel is not the best tool for data science it is very widely used software; he does an adequate job making the inferential methods explained in Excel to be understood and then, at the end of the book, explains how to use the more powerful, free R application (a standard in data science field). (Though if one wants to learn and use R this book is too basic.)

What is nice about him using Excel (with data sets that are also available for download from the publishers site) is that all the extra steps Excel requires to carry out this methods is that it also helps the reader to better grasp the reasoning of these methods along the way. That he peppers the text with a humorous style also makes this a rare treasure for data science introductory books.",2

Foreman writes clearly and uses examples of common business problems to explain the concepts of Data Science. He follows Excel equations and math with concise explanations to ensure their complete comprehension. Many of the ideas addressed in this book can be complex, especially to someone new to Data Science, but Foreman elucidates them so clearly that they are easily understood. I can't say enough about how well written is this book. I will be recommending it to many of my colleagues.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight,Great book,"Foreman is an engaging writer.

This book is aimed at someone like me, someone with a long-ago background in college statistics and a current general familiarity with Microsoft Excel. Foreman uses Excel skillfully as a teaching tool. He demonstrates repeatedly how, using Excel, it is possible to piece together hundreds (or thousands) of data micro-bits to create useful statistical predictions.

Foreman does not claim that Excel is an optimal tool for large data science projects. Data science professionals will prefer other tools (like the R language) for large-scale projects involving millions of records. Still, all by itself, Excel is serviceable for smaller-scale data science projects. And, as Foreman shows, Excel is useful as a teaching tool, to illustrate otherwise-difficult statistical concepts.

The book is well-written and useful. Five stars.",4

The explanations, examples the John provides are actionable, well explained, and helpful. If you are looking for something in Python or R, this isn't the book for you.

M. Woolliscroft,3.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight,Not for everyone,"I found this book to have some great, yet sparse, information. A few issues kept me from feeling as though I gained much from reading it. The chapters are written consistently. About the first 40% presents the information and background on the topic on which the chapter is focused. This is done in a very casual manner, with little to no mathematical backbone. Then, the remaining 60% is an excruciating work-through of examples in Excel. I'd steer readers away from this book for two main reasons - if they are comfortable with mathematical equations and if they have a background of programming.

The lack of mathematical equations means that an algorithm which could be explained in a few lines (using math) is instead drawn out over several pages. In turn, this complicates explanations and makes examples necessary, which leads to the main problem with the book. The Excel examples are a pain to read through...""click here,"" ""copy this formula here,"" etc. Anybody who is serious about practicing data science knows Excel is not the tool, so why dedicate so much time to these mundane examples? A truly general description of data science principles would present ideas in a mathematical form and allow the reader to choose which platform to implement them in. When examples of code are necessary, a platform more true to the industry (Python, R, etc.) would be nice.",2

However, once you start working with large enterprise level data sets with millions of rows and hundreds of columns of information, Excel becomes useless.
The samples the author provides are very tiny sample sets compared to what most people need to use, and the 'Solver' add-in only works on these very small sample sets.

Math Book Reviewer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series),"Bad for Students, Good for Experts","In a nutshell, the value of reading Murphy's Machine Learning highly depends on what you expect to get out of it.
------------------
As a graduate student who had read a descent number of papers in the field, I feel very conflicted about this textbook.
------------------
If you expect to teach yourself machine learning from this textbook, this is in my opinion almost surely *not* the textbook to get. (0/5 Stars)
-The content of the textbook is highly disorganized. Future chapters are constantly referenced in the text (as if you have already read them!). Perplexingly, meaningful explanations of concepts are often delayed by multiple chapters. (Ex. BIC is introduced in Ch.6 but a mathematical justification is provided only in Ch. 8 when the mathematical justification could have (and should have) been in Ch. 6).
-A number of topics are merely mentioned (like VC dimension) but not actually discussed at any reasonable length, making some sections of the textbook meaningless.
-I would instead recommend the related (but different) text Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R as it is quite accessible.
-----------
However, if you are an instructor and wish to use this textbook as a supplement to a course or are a researcher then Murphy's Machine Learning is in my opinion could be a worthwhile purchase. (4/5 stars)
-The examples, references and illustrations give the textbook a particularly nice touch. (I particularly enjoyed the example of calculating the posterior probability of user ratings of two different items on Amazon).

In summary, if you are an instructor that wants their students to learn how to read challenging exposition to prepare them for reading research papers in the field or if you wish to use this as a reference, then this is a good choice. Otherwise, pass.",17
Johnyo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series),Consider Other Options Before Purchasing.,"I'm sure if you are a Google Research Scientist and are not learning the material for the first time, this book is amazing. For everyone else, I would not recommend it. I bought this book for my Fall 2013 COMPSCI 571 class, and I regret it. Before buying this book, consider the following:

1. Take a look at the online Errata. This book is already in it's 3rd printing and it just came out. The list of corrections for this (the 3rd edition) is already mind-numbingly long. The 4th printing coming out this month will surely fix some errors, but there are just too many.
2. Our class has an online forum (for a 100 person class) where we discuss topics, and most questions are either (a) basic topics from the book that no one understood or (b) talking about how one figure in the book has multiple errors associated with it. At first I was really excited to find mistakes and submit them to the Errata - it was like I was part of the book! Now I just get frustrated and have already given up on submitting corrections.
3. Our instructor regrets using this book and modifies the examples before giving them to us in class. Our out of class readings now consist mostly of MetaAcademy.com.
4. There are hardly any worked-through examples, and many of those that are worked through have errors.
5. Many important concepts are skimmed over way too quickly. For example, there is a whole chapter on Logistic regression. However, Logistic regression is covered for exactly 2 pages. Then a weird 3D graph is presented but not explained (a common theme throughout the book is graphs that look absolutely amazing, but which convey little information as to exactly what's going on to a lay-person like me), then the rest of the chapter presents methods for doing the math, which I'm sure are useful in some sense, but I'm still thinking: ""why is this MLE not in closed form, what is a Hessian doing here... and wtf is going on?!""

Most students just got the PDF for free online, and I would highly suggest doing something other than paying $55 for this book.",121
Ning Zhao,3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series),an OK book,"I admit that there are only very few machine learning books that have enough mathematics. And to make it worse, I found that even these very rare books occasionally cannot do the mathematics right. So I did not expect that this book would be perfect when I started reading this book. I also knew there would be many typos and all that, but I honestly do not mind that too much.

Unfortunately this book still makes me feel really disappointed. I do not want to waste my time to tell people how bad this book is, but I want to be constructive in that I want to make this review helpful.

Good: the subjects of this book are very broad in machine learning field. This is the reason that I bought this book.
Bad: presentations of the contents. I really doubt that the author himself actually understands what he wrote in the book for some sections. The mathematics are way off in some parts. For example, the interpolating noise free data (page 114) and interpolating noisy data (page 125). And some basic simple mathematical facts are messed up over and over again. For example, quote ""One problem with the Gaussian distribution is that it is sensitive to outliers, since the log probability ONLY decays quadratically with distance from the center."" You know what the problem is here if you have some basic understanding of the mathematics and probabilities.

Overall I give it three star mostly because the author did a decent job when he does understand what he is talking about.",3

Romann M. Weber,3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series),Slowly Converging to a Very Good ML Book,"""Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective"" is truly ambitious in its scope. A major selling point of this work is that it covers material, such as deep learning, that other large surveys leave out. There are also some genuine insights in the book. A new perspective is always welcome in this growing technical field, and Dr. Murphy appears to have a lot to offer here.

However, the book suffers in its current form (my copy is the second printing) from the author's and publisher's hurry to get it in print. (The author admits, on the site devoted to the book, that such a rush existed.) The result is a book that, as other reviewers have noted, is less than perfectly organized and riddled with typographical and technical errors.

The errata notes on the author's site suggest that the third printing will be much improved over the first and second (including, among other things, an essentially rewritten chapter). My guess, though, is that it will take a good few years before the book's errors are altogether extirpated. (Aside: Why is it nearly impossible to determine the current printing of a book before you're actually holding it in your hands? This is pretty important if you're trying to get the cleanest copy possible.)

This book has all the ingredients of a five-star ML text. At the moment, though, it is hard to justify more than a three-star rating (especially given its hefty price). I suspect that my ultimate rating will be a function of the book's printing number, its exact shape depending largely on the diligence of the publisher, the author, and his readership.",27

In other cases, variables are used as they are vernacularly in the field; in many of these cases, this is not the precise use of the variable.

goker,2.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series),"Decent effort, but not the best ML book","This book was the textbook for the Machine Learning course I've taken and I can't say I found it very useful for learning the material on my own. This book is much more of a reference book than a self-learning book. It feels like the author's purpose was to include all the material in the field into a single, huge book. From that perspective, this is probably the most expansive book; you won't probably find any book talking about deep learning for example. However, when you're reading this book, you feel like the book was a bit rushed, it wasn't quite ready to be published. There is at least one typo in every page and a lot of them makes you wonder how that typo was missed. For example, all the algorithm references in text use wrong numbers.
One other thing, maybe again because it was a bit rushed, the book is not well organized. Most of the time you feel like the author took a bunch of sections written in different times and simply pasted them one after another. There is no coherent narrative that takes you through the text.
In short, although I appreciate the effort, I must say I'm disappointed with this book, especially given the hype about this book. I think this book needs some serious review, and first of all some proofreading.",79

AU_NLPer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series),Partial review about some details,"After I read this thread [...], I decide to buy this MLAPP. I am not working closely on machine learning, but I use machine learning techniques frequently in my research. The review is partial, because I only carefully read some independent parts.

When decide to buy this book. I care about and expect to obtain information on 1) the appropriateness of when I choose a machine learning method for a task; 2) the big picture of whole machine learning techniques; 3) the intuition of important techniques explained without jargons, and 4) how are these techniques connected;
Additionally, as an English as a second language (ESL) user, I expect the text is well organised and is written without ambiguity.

From my partial reading (mainly section 16.6 and some random stuff), I would say the book indeed covers many popular techniques (topic models, deep learnings). The author also did a very good job in describing terminologies and giving succinct descriptions about the key part and the application of each method. These are the two features I like most.

However, the downsides are 1) it is too abstract for some method descriptions that I need to leverage external materials (e.g. the original paper) to understand the method. Even though the description in the book covers the most important part, it is not sufficient and I would like to see more details. One example is in equation 16.105, why P_b(X) is not explained?
2) The text is like an oral presentation in a very long tutorial intended to cover an index of techniques. Overall, its readability (text in Section 16.6) dispoints me. I know English is not my native language. But I would still argue for this issue. Previous I read some chapters in Bishop's PRML and the lecture notes of machine learning in coursera, they do better jobs.",15

Stefan Popov,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Faith in Technology,"Ray Kurzweil has done a lot of good work. But being right on some things does not mean he is right about everything.

With his last couple of doublings on the exponential curve of human progress, he reaches deep into faith more so than science. There are some major biases and contradictions in his theories, along with getting one of his main premises completely wrong.

He thinks we can create AI when the computing power of a machine reaches the 125 trillion synapses you have in your average brain. From that point on, we never look back and rule the universe as human-machine hybrid gods.

There a couple of really big problems with that assumption.

One, he assumed each synapse in our brains is a logical switch, which at the time he wrote the book was considered a known fact. Fair mistake. But the very progress of technology proved him wrong. The latest in neuroscience has shown that the brain is vastly more complicated than that and each synapse is much closer to a very sophisticated micro-processor with thousands of gates than to a simple logical switch. So, to put that in perspective--a single developed human brain has 125 trillion (or thereabouts) processors working seamlessly in parallel, taking input from 200 billion nerve cells, with extremely low energy requirements and low heat output.

For comparison, the entire human race currently operates several billion micro-processors. I have no doubt that number will increase several-fold in the next couple of decades. The second most powerful supercomputer in the world, the Cray Titan, has 37 thousand. The next generation will have less nodes, albeit faster ones. Yes, they will get smaller, faster, more efficient. However, to think that we'll replicate in machine form the true networked complexity of the human brain in the next 10 or 20 years is just nuts, given that it takes 3-5 years to actually build the next generation of supercomputers and even more years before people actually figure out what to do with them. So, on the ‘hardware’ requirements for AI, under his original assumption, I think he was completely off and by orders of magnitude.

The even bigger issue is on the software side—his premise is that we only need to simulate the output of a super-complex system like the brain, not necessarily know how exactly the black box works. Hence, once we understand how the human brain works, we don’t need to rebuild it in machine form, we only need to build something which given the same inputs provides the same output. Then you’ll have true AI because we’ll have a machine that can self-learn, write unconstrained code, etc.

The problem here is that he has a very fundamental chicken and egg problem. The issue is that AI and digitalizing the brain is the very cornerstone of everything else in his writing—including nanobots (which even he admits will have their software written by a higher form of intelligence, not human) which truly kicks off the next stages of human-machine evolution. Right now we cannot even map what the brain really does on a molecular level, let alone accurately replicate it.

Furthermore, I know some very bright people who code for a living and even the best and brightest struggle with limited parallel programming and it gets exponentially more difficult with each level of parallelism you introduce. I am yet to meet a coder, no matter how self-confident, who will, with a straight face, claim that they can write software that can replicate or even approximate 125 trillion processors working in parallel. Kurzweil says that an AI unconstrained by physics or biology can write such code. So, while Kurzweil assumes that with increased computing power we’ll just figure such a true AI out, I’m not so sure it is that simple.

So, how do we get AI to begin with, if it truly takes a higher order of intelligence to write such an AI?

Overall, just like many futurists, there are hits and misses. I believe that when it comes to machines becoming pervasively widespread in everything we do, he is right on and has been for two decades. The next part, where humans become machine gods borders on religious (technology being the god here) fanaticism more so than on sound science.

Anyhow, time will tell, but I think he is at the very least off (if not completely wrong) on his timing—and by a lot.",15
Mark Edward Bachmann,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,The End Of Life As We Know It,"I remember several years ago telling people I had just subjected myself to the scariest book of my life after reading one about the supposedly inevitable nuclear implosion of Pakistan. Well, now I've found something that tops it, even though author Ray Kurzweil seems to imagine his book as a bolt of optimism.

Anyone who has ever played around with the arithmetic of compounding and exponential growth knows how crazy the numbers get as growth feeds on itself. The phenomenon is quite real in the world, and it describes everything from viral epidemics to Warren Buffet's fortune. Kurzweil applies the exponential growth paradigm to the future of technology. He sees not only change itself accelerating, but the rate of change too, if you can go back to your high school calculus and wrap your mind around that stomach-churning concept. The math starts quickly approaching infinity, which is why it's so weird.

""Singularity"" is a common term-of-art among theoretical physicists, who apply it to a variety of seemingly irrational constructs, such as an infinitely large mass compressed towards an infinitely small point. Kurzweil co-opts the term for his own purpose here to mean the point in time where artificial intelligence starts exceeding human intelligence. Thereafter, it takes over its own programming and, being so powerful, does a better and better job of it. Because things are already moving so fast today, the accelerating rate of change means that Kurzweil's Singularity is closer than even optimists might imagine - hence the book's title. He projects it to occur somewhere in the middle of this century. Afterwards, nothing will ever again be the same.

In physics, unimaginable things start happening at singularity points, like energy explosions within black holes. Following Kurzweil's Singularity, the most garish science fiction fantasies start becoming commonplace. The combination of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics - which he refers to collectively as GNR - will transform all aspects of human existence. He believes, for example, that nanobots released into a person's bloodstream, will facilitate a comprehensive (that is to say, 100%) map of that person, including genetic code and nervous system, that can be uploaded and downloaded at will onto new ""substrates"". In other words, robotic copies of human beings - body, mind, memories, and (one presumes) soul - can be made that will appear indistinguishable from the originals. And for that matter, those originals themselves can be re-shaped at will, giving us all the opportunity to become brilliant, strong, happy, and beautiful.

Kurzweil tells us that artificial circuits replicating themselves at a molecular level will merge with the biological circuits that constitute our nervous systems, giving rise an ""enhanced"" human super-intelligence. Once this starts happening, what we now call the Internet will in effect become telepathic, giving these enhanced humans instantaneous access to all available knowledge and information as they fashion their brave new world. You see how explosive this gets? And it's just the beginning.

Once the process gets underway, the evolving super-intelligence keeps expanding until it permeates the entire planet and, still accelerating, eventually the universe. Kurzweil suggests that movement though time-space ""wormholes"" should one day facilitate rapid travel beyond our own galaxy, taking the process literally everywhere.

I realize that my amateur's survey of Kurzweil's thinking here makes him sound like a crank. However, let there be no mistake: he is an accomplished scientist and a highly sophisticated thinker. MIT-trained, he's an expert in artificial intelligence and has put his ideas into practice as a successful tech entrepreneur. Most of this book is not even devoted to prognostications, but to an in-depth review of research currently underway that lays the practical groundwork for virtually everything he talks about (except maybe the wormhole business). While he makes numerous leaps of faith in taking us from here to there, none of his forecasts represent sheer fantasy. He is an extremely good writer, and while staying true to what is in fact pretty complex science, describes it all in a way that makes it reasonably clear to lay readers.

For all his hardcore materialism, Kurzweil also has a whimsical streak. Every 50 pages or so, he breaks up his text with imaginary light-hearted debates among himself (appearing as ""Ray""), various historical figures - Darwin, Freud, etc. - and a person named ""Molly"", who seems to be a student. Molly is bright, curious, skeptical, and not in the least bit awed by Ray or the others. The thing about Molly is that she appears in two separate guises: Molly 2004 (the year this book was being written), and Molly 2104, which is of course well beyond the Singularity. One of Kurzweil's key forecasts is that future science will learn how to arrest and even reverse the aging process, allowing people more-or-less to live forever at whatever age they choose. So Molly has made it through the Singularity and returned as a still-young woman to speak about it from experience.

Kurzweil is fully aware of the potential downside to his vision. He devotes one long chapter to what he calls ""The Deeply Intertwined Promise and Peril of GNR"". He devotes another even longer chapter to responding to critics, who have attacked his ideas from every possible perspective. While he treats most criticisms respectfully, in the end he largely dismisses them all. One partial exception and the one specific fear he himself does seem to harbor is of self-replicating nanobots. He and other scientists who seriously debate such stuff even have a short-hand term for this specter: The Grey Goo Problem. Were self-replication somehow to spin out of control, Kurzweil explains to us that in a matter of days it could, in theory, consume the Earth's entire biomass and reduce it to ""grey goo"". This is indeed a troubling prospect, since this endangered biomass includes all of us.

Interestingly, the cluster of criticisms that he responds to most gently are those arising from a spiritualist perspective. In one of his imaginary debates with ""Molly"", she repeatedly asks ""Ray"" if he believes in God. Ray surprises by dodging the question every time rather than saying no. Badgered into a corner, he finally avers: ""For the sake of your question, we can consider God to be the universe, and I said that I believe in the universe."" This sounds suspiciously like a yes, albeit with a twist. He then goes on to explain how his entire vision can be described as a picture of the universe ""waking up"" as enhanced human intelligence pervades its many corners. Religious people of an unorthodox bent might be tempted to embrace this image as God's self-realization. Fundamentalists of every stripe, however, were they to take K's cosmology seriously at all, would view it with disgust as the self-realization of God's Opposite Number.

For me, the most unnerving question that this book triggers is who will control these accelerating technologies. Reading through many passages of the book, I found it hard not hard to be thinking about Nazi scientists beavering away at the design of their Master Race, or North Korean labs re-programming the neural patterns of citizens lacking enthusiasm for Kim Jong-Un. Kurzweil seems to trust in the pragmatic good will of the scientific community, buttressed by regulation. However, not all scientists have good will, and he says nothing about who he supposes will regulate the regulators. I also find it hard to see what joy or challenge there could be in a world where machines or enhanced humans dominate everything. People choosing not to become ""enhanced"" would either have it forced upon them or face life as a sub-species. The line between utopia and dystopia here is pretty fuzzy, and I find it a little scary that Kurzweil doesn't seem to care. Maybe I've seen too many science fiction movies.

All that aside, I highly recommend this book. Decades ago when I was in college I used to describe about every other book I read as ""changing my life"", as we said in the day. Nowadays, no book changes my life, although the best ones still move the needle for me. Whether I like it or not, this one has me looking at things a little differently than I did before.",11
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Too smart for most - pity!,"First check Ray Kurzweil's biography. I trust you agree that he’s probably quite smart, a serial achiever, and a thinker of consequence, fairly unique and that his deliberations might deserve serious consideration. I have studied his 2005 book ‘The Singularity is Near – when Humans Transcend Biology” and have recognised it as the foundation to much that has been written, reproduced and debated ever since. I’m no different and I’ve leant heavily on his work in my book 'Leading into the Future' (WIP).
The publication of ‘The Singularity is Near’ was ground breaking and remains a definitive logic study of science not because it’s the only treatise of a technology shaped future but precisely because it was written by Ray Kurzweil. He is the man on the spot; in the know and part of the collegiate of thought leaders that are making it happen. This is no armchair ‘what might be’ expose or a new series script for a ‘Space Odyssey’ sequel. It is an explanation of why it is so and why it matters, and it is still today, discussed and debated; it remains highly relevant and a verifiable road map of our progress towards actualization of technological progress.",4
Matt Mayevsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Opinions on this book are extreme.,"Opinions on this book are extreme. From delight to devastating criticism. Nevertheless, I decided to read The Singularity is Near. I do not regret.

I do not agree with everything he writes Ray Kurzweil theories, some parts are inconclusive, but on the other hand, what would be the sense reading only those books and a selection of these authors, with which I agree one hundred percent? Polemics, if constructive allows for intellectual development.

Although Ray Kurzweil's forecasts seem exaggerated, and his foresight is limited to one scenario that monumentality, a wide range of thematic GNR (Genetics, Nanotechnology, Robotics) fascinates and eliminates dimensional, hurray-optimistic vision.

The Singularity is Near moments can be associated with a science fiction novel, with an emphasis on science. Fans of the genre (cyberpunk) will not be disappointed. This of course does not take away the value of the book, but it adds.",1
PhilippeV,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Our empathy grows through difficult and sometimes painful choices made during our life,"Core of Evolution: Information or Empathy ?

Kurzweil points to an exponential evolution of Information technology, whereas religions and philisophies consider the core of evolution being growing Empathy. Is there a contadiction or a complimentary view ?

Kurzweil brings us to open our minds to an exponetial growing (to the second degree) information world, where the singularity point would be reached in 2040. Point at which non-biological intelligence (information) would outgrow the biological information evolution of mankind.

Considering that our own biological body would itself be gradually enhanced we would ourselves experience an exponential growing evolution capable to outreach the Universe. But also our human « embodied » self could be maintained alive for an infinite time. Our DNA + brains could be reverse engineered and copied into non-biological bodies (whatever shape they have).

But now consider that our physical – three dimensional + time – is itself a creation of our soul which is infinite and part of another dimension that is not limited to the physial world and not limited to it 's laws governing the physical dimension.

If you have difficulty to accept the idea of a « soul », or consider it is just a projection of humans to accept our death as a final end to the existence, then just try to assume something external to this physical dimension created our physical world and all the laws governing it – from the Big Bang to the appearance of Life, Intelligece and the concept of growing Evolution.

Kurzweil considers the ultimate evolution being our future ability to outgrow the Universe with Information, and “reduces” our human existence – even if exponentially growing – to information.
Even puts the core to our physical world as being information, rather than energy and matter.
A very challenging and interesting approach, which must be considered with an open mind.

And it does not contradict the vision (or spiritual approach) to evolution whereas a soul is projecting itself to our limited physical world to experience the evolution of mankind empathy. As Jeremy Rifkin points out (The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis) the evolution shows an ever growing empathy which itself is linked to growing means of communication and producing/consuming energy. By the way, I'm pointing to Jeremy Rifkin, not as a religious guru but just because he is NOT a religious guru. Rifkin's observation reconciles the core of most religions and phlisohical reflexions about the existence and direction of evolution. And Rifkin made no link to the existence (or non-existence) of a soul, it's a link I make personally.

Kurzweil forcasts the projection of human consciousness into total virtual reality. But this would only be a surrogate of real life. Our empathy grows through difficult and sometimes painful choices made during our life. The experience of total virtual reality – very convenient to meet with somebody far away – would shield us from these difficult and painful choices. The same way I can be injured and even die in a computer game without being injured in my physical body.

If you assume the existence of a soul (again with an open minded approach) then something does survive our biological existence. That soul decides the major obstacles and encounters it will experience in its chosen (with guidance?) next physical life – call it destiny – allowing the embodied self to make choices during his physical life, each choice bringing him some experience of growing (or decreasing) empathy. So each physical life has a definite reason to be limited in time. We might have made some wrong choices (wrong towards growing empathy) our death allows us then to understand what happened and make choices for the next physical life allowing the evolution towards growing Universal empathy.

That means also that a human brain does not contain all the elements contained in the soul. The human brain would then « just » be a relay to our non-physical soul. What is the exclusive part of the soul, not being contained in our brains, is unknown. But at least does limit our exponentially growing information technology to ever copy/backup/replicate a human being as a whole, as the exclusive soul components would be missing.

And what happens to a Human body version 2,0 with infinite life extension ? Our soul would be kept emprisonned in a body without the ability to reconsider past choices and bring some new challenges to pursue it's evolution ?

No answers, but Kurzweil excellent book at least opens questions about the core of our existence.",1
R. Mullen,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Shorter is sometimes better. Though several thought provoking ideas.,"Wow, for the sake of those, including me, who have made it through this book, I'll be brief. It could be 400 pages shorter. The author makes it clear he thinks very highly of himself and the book includes a lot of wind about the author, that he wrote for himself.

B_Par,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,An Excellent and Thorough Perspective of the Future,"I've always thought about the future. It's in our nature to do so, though I think I tend to give it a more thorough and solid analysis of its possibilities than most. I've always heard of new advancements in technology and predictable patterns which I never took the time, nor hand the knowledge or data, to sit down and analyze. Ray Kurzweil does just that.

The book is centralized around the Law of Accelerated Returns. Kurzweil looks toward the future with cautious optimism, predicting positive progress for humanity, but also warning against its negative, though subtle in contrast to the positive, consequences. I like how Kurzweil discusses a bunch of different concepts, such as wormholes, aging, the economy, nanotechnology, and computers.

This book was written in 2005. I'm reading it in 2013 (and NOT because it took me this long - I elected the audiobook). I like reading this a little later so you can see how accurate his predictions were for the next few years. Also, it's more hopeful to think that he mentions something incredible happening 20 years out, which if you're reading it today, is only 12 years ahead.

I would highly recommend the audiobook from Audible. This is NOT a sit-down-and-read-for-fun book. It's difficult, time-consuming, and full of words you'll likely struggle to pronounce, especially if you're a slow, meticulous reader like I am. It's like walking through a swamp - fun, scenic, but slow and demands a lot of energy. Listening to the audiobook is like taking a hovercraft across that swamp. It makes it a lot easier to absorb, and you don't have to be drudging through pages of fine text in order to get the message. The Audible version is great. The reader takes a few minutes to get used to, but after that, it's natural and easy to absorb.

If they haven't already, they should make this into a movie.

Also, if you're looking for a good drinking game, take a sip every time he uses the word 'panoply'. I think you'll be surprised how often this comes up. I was, considering that I haven't heard anyone use this word ever.",2
V. Guardiola,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Too much!,"Despite very interesting (and revolutionary!) ideas and information, the main message of the author, that human minds will merge into a global something and become ""disembodied"" is too much for me (and I am a science fiction lover....).
The message is not convincing at all, not substanciated. ""The second machine age"" (McAffee) is much more convincing about what to expect from digitalization, global connnection etc... ""in the short term"". And, as Keynes once (supposedly) said, ""in the long term, we are all dead"". Ray Kurzweil would disagree, of course (machine-based minds can ""live"" forever).",2
Bob Powell,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Becoming dated but full of great ideas,"Like so many forward looking texts, Ray Kurzweil's book has suffered a little from the intervening time since writing. This does not detract from the fact that the core ideas are valid and that mankind is set upon a path that will take us towards a future in which integration of machine and human is almost inevitable.
The proposition that an intelligent ""being"" not born of woman but born as a side effect of our own intelligence is a scary prospect but, once again almost inevitable given that if experience tells us anything, emergent behaviour is a law of nature. The combination of amino acids into DNA and life itself is an emergent behaviour that took place on a logarithmic timescale over a billion years or so. Since then the pace has picked up almost to the point where the line on today's chart of development is to all intent and purpose, vertical.
We may not see this exact vision in the next few years but what will happen is likely to be as scarily close to Kurzweil's idea that it will make no difference and make him a prophet indeed.",1

However, there has to be a spot somewhere in the middle where we look at the great benefits as well as looking at the downside of technology.

In that vein, don't buy this book unless you are extremely patient, can wade through constant repetition, and can overlook an extremely one-sided (albeit rosy) view of the next 40 years. The author essentially believes technology will expeditiously resolve all of earth's and humanity's problems, including the inevitability of death. And that we as human beings will make wise use of extremely powerful technology for the benefit of all, overcoming all obstacles. Please! I give the book two stars because there are a number of very provocative ideas brought forth, which should be explored. Other than that, the book is almost unreadable. The themes in the book could easily be thoroughly explored in a quarter of the space. As a number of reviewers have suggested, the author badly needs a first rate editor.",2
Tony Earl,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,This book has changed everything about how I see our world.,"I have to admit my first response to it was, ""Nice fantasy.

I looked at the copyright and noticed it was almost ten years old, so I checked every data point I had easy access to, and was surprised to find they fit his curves within a tiny margin of error. I read Hofstadter's book, ""I Am A Strange Loop,"" then went back and finished ""Singularity.""

Despite all my doubts, I was awe-struck to find from other sources just how far along we are on the technologies Kurzweil discusses. I guess I had two basic objections: a belief that exponential curves don't last long in reality, and plain, simple incredulity. After spot checking his data from unrelated sources, I am now convinced I was wrong, that Ray Kurzweil is correct. We are heading toward explosive growth (we're all experiencing it, now) followed by a discontinuity beyond which we can't see.",1

It's not a good read because of that style, it's a read because of the theories and futuristic thoughts or possible projections.

Now the Kindle edition leaves much to be desired.

David Field,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Probably the most important book you'll ever read,"Good evening.

You may know me as the genial, white-haired book reviewer, but I once had a secret identity. I was Doctor D. Filed, the mad scientist, and my job was to introduce children to ""the future,"" around when they were nine years old.

You may remember ""the future."" We would zoom round the galaxy, meeting alien races, living forever, and having robot computers that were smarter than we are. However, all this would happen many years from now, and our great-great-grandchildren's great-great-grandchildren might catch a little glimpse of it. Otherwise the future we ourselves encountered would be just like today, only more so.

However, Ray Kurzweil has been doing the math on those last two things, and he has a revised date for when we'll be immortal and have super-smart computers. And his date is . . .

2045.

That's right, the year 2045, thirty-five years from now, less than half a lifetime. That means that more than half the people alive today will see that date. And don't take that to be some wishful thinking. Kurzweil has extrapolated the rate of change in technology and biology to arrive at that date. He points out that these technologies improve exponentially. That means that if our technology knowledge doubles every year, we are not going to see twenty times the knowledge in a decade, but two multiplied by itself ten times, or over a thousand times.

Kurzweil quotes the Human Genome Project, which after seven years of a fifteen-year process, had completed one percent of its work. However, it finished on time, because technology improved all through that period. His work is meticulously sourced, with many a footnote reference. His charts show that over and over again knowledge takes an exponential course. EDIT: I read recently of a human genome being read in four weeks, and today I hear of someone who did it in a week. Exponential enough for ya? EDIT of EDIT:An ex-ICU nurse told me today (9/9/09) that someone who nursed in an ICU as little as three years ago would have to go through months of training to get up to speed on ICU changes since then. AND THE LAST EDIT: ""Complete Genomics has completed 14 genomes since March (20 human genomes in the world have been published), priced at $5000, and aims to complete 10,000 genomes by the end of 2010."" (also 9/9/09, still less than twenty years since the first mapping.)

He believes that ""the singularity,"" no matter how far away it seems today, will be here on time. This will mean that some technologies will reach their limits, but new technologies will arise before they're needed. The history of computer technology certainly bears him out. Equally biology is helping us understand the brain, so its re-creation in software is likely to happen.

You might think that there is too much to learn about the brain, but it's a reasonably simple machine with complex ways of doing things. So let's just concentrate on the higher powers, rather than reconstructing neurons. To give you an example, for more than a hundred years we have been able to fly. We've had birds around us all through human history, but we didn't copy them. Pretty much all our development has been with fixed- and rotating-wing aircraft being pulled through the air. Our ""non-bird"" flying has made us superior to birds, but we also have to get up there and come down safely. Hence a non-neuron brain, provided that it works at a higher level, can replace an incredibly complex series of cells.

Kurzweil believes that we'll see advances in GNR, or Genetics, Nanotechnologies, and Robotics. Our DNA will be transformed to make us unable to catch major diseases, we'll have tiny machines inside our bloodstream, and these machines will improve our health from within. The day before I wrote this I read of ""bacteria-based computing,"" and we're already capable of putting together tiny machines atom by atom, so it's not far away.

Where does that leave us? Don't look at me - my white hair is a result of being born in World War II. I won't see the singularity - but you might. Many people try to believe that it will never happen as soon as Kurzweil says - but that's like going out in a thunderstorm ""because hardly anybody gets killed by lightning."" The day will come, because ""Objects seen in the future are closer than they appear.""

When those things happen it will cause a major disruptive force. Some understanding of what's to come makes us more able to judge these technologies when they occur. An unprepared population is likely to be panicked into making a wrong choice. I'm sure your reaction to this news was a kind of fear - when something needs fixing that you thought was OK. Kinda like your first reaction to Global Climate Change.

But just as we recognized and now are doing something toward fixing Global Warming, so we can recognize this and discuss it. It's obviously a far bigger problem, but even if the projections are off it's still likely to occur. Most people don't realize that there are more embedded computers than people in the world - chips that run your remote control, your car, and your dishwasher. We are so used to them we don't even know that they are there.

Some criticisms of this book are that it's repetitive, but Kurzweil has to show that everything points to it. His background is impeccable, but I wouldn't take dozens of pills as he does, but then I've given up living long enough to see The Singularity. I applaud him for not making the book into some kind of horror story, and his apparent optimism is simply explaining that the process will happen, and there are enough good things to look forward to dealing with it.

You may agree with Kurzweil or you may not, but at least you'll know that there is an issue coming up that you'll probably have to deal with. Parts of it may seem unlikely to happen, but you're reading this on a system that has just about all the knowledge in the world, and the half human/half computers will have direct access to it. In fact, we'll invent the last machine we need - the ""inventing machine,"" which will be like the ""mathematic machine"" we call a computer, but it will invent new things and even improve itself.

So don't laugh at the white-haired book reviewer - in the late twenty-first century, and the twenty-second century, and the twenty-third century, this could be you, telling the youngsters how unlimited knowledge and life was once a figment of people's imaginations.

And if you have the slightest interest in this subject, buy this book. In 1975 - thirty-five years before now, imagine a book that told you what life would be like in 2010 - Communism crushed, a computer in just about every home, and all the knowledge in the world on tap. This book is far more important than the 1975 book, and I'll bet you wished you'd read the 1975 book and made a few wise investments. But ""The Singularity Is Near"" will prepare you for a major coming crisis, and you'd better be prepared.",6

Barbara S. Reeves,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,The day is coming that is going to render life as we know it today unrecognizable.,"""Life is a daring adventure or nothing at all."" - Helen Keller

I used to have this argument I used to convince myself that there is a god. It went like this: Man has invented many things during his time here on earth: the steam engine, telephone, cars, artificial hearts, computers. You name it, the list is long. Now what would you say is his greatest invention so far? The internet? The newest, fastest computer? Does his greatest invention even compare to the human body, mind, and spirit? Has he invented anything that compares with the splendor of a giant sequoia? The brutally, ferocious great white shark? Or the majesty of an African lion? Not to mention this planet and the rest of the cosmos. I think not.

Something infinitely more intelligent than us must have created life. But let me stop right there. What I have to tell you will possibly turn that argument upside down. What I want to tell you is that sometime in the not too distant future, something is going to happen that is going to render life as we know it today unrecognizable. That something is called the singularity.

The singularity is the moment when technological change becomes so rapid and profound that it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history. Ray Kurzweil has written a book about it called ""The Singularity is Near"". He is a world famous inventor and invented the first print to speech reading machine for the blind. Stevie Wonder was his first customer. He holds 39 patents and 19 honorary doctorate degrees.

In 1999, Bill Clinton awarded him the National Medal of Technology. He has written extensively about the singularity and Bill Gates has called him the best person he knows at predicting the future of artificial intelligence. It has been said that his scientific and philosophical views are a ""substitute vision for those who have lost faith in the traditional object of religious belief."" And Kurzweil believes the end of human civilization, as we know it, is only 35 years away.

Kurzweil says that our technological evolution is a continuation of our biological evolution, that we will merge with our machines. Nanotechnology will enable the design of nanobots, robots designed at the molecular level, such as ""respirocytes"" (mechanical red blood cells). Nanobots will interact with biological neurons in the brain to create virtual reality (that will be undistinguishable from real reality) from within the nervous system. We will be able to scan the human brain and ""upload"" it and that the process will capture a person's entire personality, memory, skills, and history. Oh yeah, and we'll be able to live forever if we choose to.

Some of this is just too amazing to believe, but look at our iPhones. They're a millionth the size of, a millionth the price of, and many times more powerful than a computer from 40 years ago. Flip that forward 40 years. What does the future look like then? It won't be long before we're implanting them in our skulls. The power of information technologies is growing exponentially, doubling about every year. We're about to witness an explosion in technological achievement.

So, imagine if you took a caveman and dropped him in Times Square in New York City today. What would he think? Would he even be able to comprehend what he is seeing? The technological growth from his day to ours, thousands of years, is now happening in a few decades. So if you took one of us today, and dropped him in the year 2045, he will be as dumbfounded as that cave man. Due to the exponential growth of our technology, our future of only a few decades away, will be totally unrecognizable to us today. And there's a name for it. It's called the singularity.

Kurzweil builds the case that the Integration of human minds with the digital mind (The Singularity) will be possible by 2045.

At first blush, the thesis of this book appears far-fetched and the time-line absurd.

Jose A.,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,"Great science fiction and futurism, timeline unlikely","For anyone interested in futurism and science fiction (with a bit more science) this book would be a thrilling read; it certainly makes for some interesting ""what if"" discussions across the dinner table. I'm sure any reasonable person would view a lot of Kurzweil's projections as extreme and speculative, but perhaps criticizing an author for being speculative in a field (futurism) that essentially calls upon people to speculate may be a bit misguided.

The only serious criticism that I have for Kurzweil is that his time line seems HIGHLY unlikely. Like many futurists, he mostly bypasses any discussion of the economics of these discoveries, but rather treats progress as if it were 'only' a matter of figuring out solutions to technical problems. His time projections might make more sense if researchers had bottomless bank accounts, but it seems more reasonable that his time line be extended at least 3 or 4 times over to account for the fact that finding ways to establish markets that will fund this enormous amount of research will not be an easy task. I'm sure he'd say that I'm stuck in the ""linear"" model of human progress, but even with granting the coming of the singularity and his law of exponentially growing returns I can't see his expectations coming about so soon.

Iveta Kazoka,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,a fantastic utopia for 21st century,"When reading this book on my Kindle just 2 weeks ago, I was constantly asking myself - how come I hadn't come across this book much earlier? This book was EXACTLY what I was looking for when I searched in vain for contemporary utopias.

It's hard to believe that it was written 6-7 years ago. Even for an avid reader of Scientific American, New Scientist and all those oh so numerous science blogs, it still reads like a cutting-edge science book.

In a world filled with dystopian thinking (believe me, I haven't come across any contemporary fiction book which would be optimistic about the future even though we are living in the Golden Age of humanity), this is like a breath of fresh air.

Although from time to times, when reading this book, I forgot to breathe - that's how ambitious the ideas and the post-singularity world envisioned bt Ray Kurzweil seemed to me. The basic premise of the book is that ""the power of ideas to transform the world is itself accelerating"" which means that ""the progress that will be achieved in the 20th century will be about one thousand times greater than what was achieved in the twentieth century."" And the author attempts to describe such a world - as best as he can.

Even though in a hindsight of 7 years, he seems to have been a bit over-optimistic about the pace of progress (the world of 2012 still hasn't reached what was envisioned for 2010), it's hard not to see that we're broadly moving in the direction described in the book.

I just love the fact that the author was daring enough to envision the ultimate aim of humanity (post-singularity). Oh, the audacity it takes to proclaim in a non-fiction book that once ""the matter and mechanisms of the universe will be transformed into exquisitely sublime forms of intelligence""! I am not sure if such will ever be achieved, but that's not what is important. The important thing is to light up new visions, new dreams for humanity, and what could be more noble and more grandiose than the aim to wake up the Universe!",3
Nur Nodes in NiL,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Fantastic Ideas But Where do We Start?,"I would give Mr. K five stars for bringing up the idea of the singularity and its importance to living beings. But I would lose a star because of his almost insane optimism and timeline about these ideas (Personally I think it could happen if we dont mess things up first and at the earliest 2050 but more like 2150).

I would drop another star for his writing style which is redundant, disjointed (the sudden dialogues are out of place and seem silly) and even boring. The quotes though are great and show their are others that agree with some of these ideas.

But if you can put aside Mr. K fanaticism that borders on looney cultism, there is really something to be said for the fact science and technology could dramatically improve life not just in the far future but even today. Plus the book indirectly points out that more thought should be given to this. Space exploration is nice and all (and needed for the long run) but Computer Science I believe is worthy of
a Manhattan Project (but with a few dozen safety nets) to try to solve our biggest problems at hand that we often overlook: death, aging, hunger, loneliness, wealth disparity, and extreme suffering (war, psychological oppression etc).

For the most part people I know just accept these things as part of life (even perhaps part of the strange beauty of life) but I agree with Mr. K that that is fatalistic. If we are very careful about how we do it, we can make life better.
The main problem will be the ethical aspect and who and how they can make sure that the living spirit is not actually damaged by all this.

So major Kudos for Mr. K for bring up that the future is not necessarily gloomy but could make life better. But all the more reason people should discuss this so the
ethical aspects are worked with it. There could be volumes of books trying to work out the laws and freedoms that are needed for this very possible future.

Lastly , I must admit I am looking for a new spirtual vision. I call myself a reluctant atheist. I really wish I could believe in God again. Or at least could see a path to enlightenment. But even buddhism to me seems to be missing something or is often overlooked for being in harmony with science. So my point is I believe ""Futurism"" (the belief that we can make life better in the very near future and beyond) is a new hope. And I am glad to have read this book as part of futurism.",2
Political Pen,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Get Ready for the Future While You Are Still Human,"The Singularity is Near is one of the most audacious books I have ever read outside of religious texts. I mean audacious in a positive manner, in terms of the scope of material covered, the command of technical detail and inspired vision of the future. For a relative small price to pay, the reader is invited on a mind-blowing journey of what is possible in the near future, due to the relentless and overpowering reach and march of technology, and an extrapolation of where that journey is taking us.
Glimpses of that extrapolation can be seen even now.

Bottomline, Kurzweil explains in fairly understandable detail where the exponential growth in computer processing, microelectronic and medical advancements are taking us and the book is as much a warning for humans to get ready for the future as an inspired vision. By 2045 Kurzweil predicts the Singularity will occur; that is, humans will transcend biology, i.e. we will no longer be fully human but will be ""part man/woman and part machine"" or cyborg in other words. The implications are not grasped by many Kurzweil implies but he attempts to prove by extrapolation from Moore's Law and the Turing Test how that might occur. Kurzweil contends that once the Singularity is achieved, humanity will be off to the races in terms of growth potential since human intelligence will be digitized and can be uploaded, downloaded, and interchanged much like computers operate today and the human body will be increasingly machine-like as organs will become passe'.

The book is an intellectual feast whether one agrees with Kurzweil or not. There are great discussions as to when computers will become indistinguishable versus humans (Turing Test), a calculation of the computing power of a rock (yes, you read correctly) and a romp in the calculation of the likely number of intelligent civilizations in the universe (Kurzweil thinks there is only one and it happens to be us) using the Drake Equation where he explains his assumptions in each variable. The latter exposition is the single best discussion I have ever read anywhere (Sagan et al)on the issue of intelligent life potential in the universe. If nothing else, the book is dynamite to any serious reader who likes to ponder the future and technological change.

The downside for many readers will be Kurzweil's atheistic approach which views humanity as souless organisms and an unrealistic view that the bulk of current humanity could ever reach the potential he describes. As a Christian I don't take offense at Kurzweil's thesis, however, because the Bible argues that humanity only reaches full potential in Christ, otherwise humanistic approaches devolve into evil whether abetted by technology or not. Kurzweil is only focusing on the humanistic approach and he doesn't believe (his opinion) that the trends he is discussing will progress toward evil or cause ever more chaos in the world. That perhaps is a very tall stretch when considering the shape of our world today. Notwithstanding, I can accept Kurzweil's thesis without offense because it is one man's opinion versus that of many others. I can thank him, though, that his projections are as much a warning as to where technology can be taking us and the scientific community is not preparing the rest of us very well on that subject.

Objectively, one should appreciate the brilliance of Kurzweil, his command of technical issues and his sheer attempt at depicting such a theme in the first place. Truly audacious.",2
Roger B. White Jr.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,"Technofiction review of ""The Singularity is Near""","Ray Kurzweil's ""The Singularity is Near"" got my mental juices flowing. It was a fun read.

The book is long, but the point is simple: technological change is happening at an accelerating rate and that means even bigger changes are in store for humanity.

Kurzweil then fleshes this premise out with his own experiences in the computer industry. He presents numerous charts and graphs to show what he means by accelerating change.

Basically he is saying that more and more of the earth's resources will be devoted to computing power, and this will continue a trend that has been going on since life first came to earth. It's a neat concept.

The exciting part is when he then extrapolates this trend into changes that are coming up in the next few decades. He says this trend will show itself as the ""overlapping GNR revolutions"" -- changes that are coming due to discoveries and exploitation of Genetics, Nanotechnology and artificial intelligence (Robotics).

The results he forecasts for the next few decades due to these revolutions are astoundingly optimistic, but I found them believable. Basically he is forecasting that human longevity will extend dramatically over the next thirty years, and human and silicon intelligences will start mixing into a hybrid form.

It's neat! The biggest issue I had with his concept is that people in a ""Singularity"" don't experience it as a singularity -- what they feel is just business as usual. We, for instance, don't feel anything astounding about having new gizmo's invented pretty much every day, but that rate would have astounded our Stone Age ancestors. And for that reason the timing of his singularity could be off by decades and earth's history would never notice.

But I think his trend-thinking is solid, and it sure makes for an exciting sounding future!

And now time for a plug. If you enjoy this book, you may enjoy some of mine. In particular you may enjoy my insights into human thinking in Evolution and Thought, or my science fiction speculations in Tips for Tailoring Spacetime Fabric Vols. 1 and 2.

Arthur P. Smith,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Is this Reality? And is it good for us?,"Among technological optimists in the world, the ""singularitarians"", led by Ray Kurzweil, are perhaps the most extravagant, extrapolating from the growth in information technologies of the past century. This book provides a good review of the ideas behind this optimism, and its likely consequences over the next century or so. It also raises and partly addresses a few central questions: do these extrapolations faithfully represent reality? Do they really extend beyond information technology to our control of the material world around us? And how can Kurzweil be so sure the predicted doubly exponential progress will be good for us?

Kurzweil's fundamental basis for optimism is his ""Law of Accelerating Returns"" for information technology, which claims that the components of our information systems naturally grow in capability at an exponential rate, and that as each reaches limits, it is superceded by new technology with ever-faster exponential growth rates. Not only is the growth exponential, but the rate of growth is itself growing exponentially. Kurzweil even justifies this ""law"" with a mathematical appendix that suggests the exponent should grow roughly at the same rate as world GDP; he does not mention that the actual rate he finds is a little under half that (1.2% vs 2.8% annually for the 20th century). As I argue elsewhere, if one discounts the putative computation rates per thousand dollars of the early years of the twentieth century (before 1920), the numbers seem to just as easily fit a non-growing exponential rate (0% instead of 1.2%), so it seems hard to saw Kurzweil's ""law"" is at all proven. The next decade or so will be the real test, as integrated circuits are replaced by whatever the next technological leap coming along is.

The idea that this acceleration applies beyond information technologies has also been criticized by people like physicist Jonathan Huebner, who argues that we are, far from entering an era of exponentially greater growth in capabilities, actually approaching a new dark age. Huebner claims the rate of technological innovation per person per year reached a peak a century ago, and the decline now, despite high R&D and education funding, is because developing new technology beyond what's already been done has become more and more difficult. Kurzweil has his own list of innovations to refute this, but he does not manage to make a convincing case that his ""law of accelerating returns"" is in any way a necessary consequence of the way the world works. In comparing linear and exponential behavior in the first chapter, Kurzweil notes that ""people tend to overestimate what can be achieved in the short term (because we leave out necessary details)"". There are many details Kurzweil has necessarily skipped over, but no indication that he thinks he might himself be overestimating.

So we may have accelerating returns, continued exponential growth, or much slower growth or even decline, depending on your view of the world. At least with either of the growing curves, Kurzweil's other projections still apply, but under plain exponential growth would be simply delayed a bit. Kurzweil estimates a ""human-level"" computer would require between 10^16 and 10^19 cycles per second. With accelerating returns, that computer would be under $1000 at some point between 2020 and 2030. If the growth continues only on a simple exponential, we have to wait until after 2050 for human-scale personal computing. Kurzweil fully intends to be alive when his brain can be scanned and uploaded to a simulation of immortality, a motive that perhaps overly encourages him to argue for the earlier date.

Kurzweil sets 2045 as the date for the Singularity itself, the point when all this computer power really transforms our capabilities. If the plain exponential law is true instead, the date for comparable computational capabilities is pushed back to the first decade of the 22nd century. Continued doubly exponential growth in computational power would reach the ultimate computational capacity of our solar system, between 10^70 and 10^80 calculations per second, before 2120, within the natural life-span of some alive today. Growth along the ordinary exponential would not reach such astronomical scales until the 25th century. Depending on whether such vastly enhanced intelligence can find a way around the speed-of-light restriction or not, Kurzweil sees a universe filled with computation possible less than 200 years from today.

This vast growth in computational power is the central element on which much of the remaining speculation of the book rests; it's an awe-inspiring story, and even if slower growth pushes back some of the these dates a century or three, it is still worth understanding where augmenting human intelligence with machines may take us. Kurzweil's arguments for the development of real artificial intelligence in the relatively near future, given computational capabilities, seem sound enough. His commentary on the issue of subjectivity (if I get uploaded, which one is ""me""?) is one of the most lucid I have ever seen. But he wastes far too much time on Searle's Chinese Room argument against AI; just a simple statement that the scale of complexity invalidates the comparison should have been enough.

Kurzweil identifes three related revolutions underway: in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics (strong AI). These enable the information technology revolution to be extended to the living, material and mental worlds; many wonders are to be expected. In particular, his outline for ""brain uploading"" depends on nanomachines capable of penetrating the brain and recording patterns there, a rather invasive (but believable) approach.

At times, Kurzweil's book veers into millenial apocalypsism, at one point describing ""Singularitarianism"" as an almost religious belief in the ability to be uploaded and live forever, and listing several articles of faith. Kurzweil acknowledges the religious element but asserts that this is different: traditional religion is primarily a rationalization of death, while the Singularity makes death a thing of the past. How will existing religions respond to such notions?

One very serious question is the possibility of threats from these new technologies - every individual will have vast power, beyond anything even nations have today. There is the ""gray goo"" threat from nanotechnology, as Bill Joy has articulated. Kurzweil acknowledges, yes there are dangers, in fact he agrees with Joy in many respects. Unfortunately we will have to keep several steps ahead, with ""immune systems"" deployed against the threats, before they wreak havoc. The most worrisome threat is from Strong AI itself - once they supercede human intelligence, what will prevent them from overcoming any bounds we may have set against harming us? Kurzweil's main response to this threat is that ""they"" will be ""us"", uploaded and greatly enhanced, so it doesn't much matter what happens to the old biological world. This is, to say the least, a little unsettling...

In addition to the copious graphical illustrations, Kurzweil adds to the text some imaginary conversations with historical, present, and future persons, including Eric Drexler, Bill Gates, Darwin, and Freud. He seems to have obtained permission from the living for this; sometimes these conversations enlighten, but they seem oddly contrived.

Kurzweil does have a fascinating view of our potential future. Whether near or far, this book is a useful guide to how the world will change at that point where humans transcend biology.",15

B. F.

Progress is real and we all live longer and better than those who've come before us. Still, Kurzweil's vision hinges on exponential growth of certain technology. Many books (mostly apocalyptic) make predictions on exponential growth (The Population Explosion, Bankruptcy 1999... don't remember those books, yeah, there's a reason why), The problem is that exponential growth always stops. Something always limits it, usually long before it has all the dramatic effects people are counting on. Kurweil's predictions are likely to be no different.

Kurzweil begins by suggesting that evolution actually follows an exponential curve of growth and thus we can no longer consider linear projection methods based on past events. According to him we are on the knee of that exponential curve having come from the previous phases that included matter and chemistry, DNA and Brains, up to the current phase of evolution which he states as that of technology development. Apparently our technological developments are on the verge of massive activity as we gear up for the next evolutionary phase which is.......wait for it.......""The Merger of Technology and Human Intelligence"". We are headed for a time where human biology is obsolete and outdated, where human and artificial intelligence are indistinguishable.
Far fetched? Maybe the time frames are optimistic and the ramifications full of uncertainty but there is something very logical about his argumentation.

unraveler,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Singularity is Nowhere Near,"The singularity is not near. It may happen someday or it may never happen. If it happens it is likely to happen in ways quite different from those imagined by Kurzweil (because imagination and reality often diverge) and it is way off into the future. Here are the problems with Kurzweil's argument about singularity happening in 2045. First, his data points that presumably illustrate ubiquitous exponential growth are arbitrary. He cherry picks and fudges data to fit his preferred conclusion. Second, sharply rising curves that go into infinity exist in mathematics; they do not exist in the physical world. Third, a number of his specific predictions are outlandish and verifiably inaccurate. For example, he predicted that desktop computers would disappear by 2009 and cars would drive themselves by 2019, replacing human drivers and by 2020 there would be one-world government. Fourth, his technological reductionism is breathtakingly conceited. He seems to think that there is a clearly-defined, inevitable path of human development dictated by technology itself, again, see his prediction about world government or his prediction that artificial intelligence will try to convert inanimate/dead matter into artificially intelligent, sentient one. Fifth, he seems to be convinced that the human brains and the human biological in general are computable, but gives no proof of that. In conclusion, singularity is nowhere near and if and when it arrives, it will look quite different from what Kurzweil imagines in his work of science fiction. His book offers hope and psychological escape. Others have pointed out that is a secular, techie version of Rapture. And I agree. This book predicts immortality and unlimited intelligence 30 years from now. It is a psychological relief, an escapist fantasy from a messy, challenging, corrupt and so far unpredictable world.",6
Christopher T. Rogers,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Audio CD,"I love the content of this book. Even though it's filled with speculation, I was hooked even before I bought the book. Call it bias, but the singularity has my interest peaked and this book (audio book) delivered, teaching me more than I could have ever imagined.

I give it 3 stars because of the gentleman who does the reading. Monitone is an understatement. There is no inflection or excitement in this guys voice. My collegues have called this audio book ""the perfect sleeping pill."" Very interesting and very hard to get through at the same time. I should have just bought the book and done the reading for myself.

I will never buy another audiobook read by the gentleman who read this one. Yawn!",1
Stephen C. Clark,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,"Agree or disagree, it's well worth a read","I'm going to rate this book five stars, because at nearly 500 pages packed with important ideas (plus another hundred pages of notes) there is no question that this weighty book was well worth my $20.

As you might expect, Ray is at the top of his game when examining trends in computer science. He has many examples of ""narrow"" A.I. to share. More importantly, he believes that computer modeling of brain functioning will yield the algorithms we need in order to eventually achieve an artificial general intelligence. Indeed, cognitive science is exploding thanks to increases in computing and scanning power, and the brain will likely yield up many of its secrets in coming years. I find his predictions in this area quite believable.

I found some of his arguments regarding nanotechnology to be less convincing. In particular, his predictions for nanorobotics seem optimistic beyond all reason given the currently nascent state of this technology. Examples drawn from the current state of the art seem almost hopelessly far removed from the robust and exceedingly powerful technology he imagines within 25 years. On the other hand, if these surprising predictions are borne out it will be a powerful confirmation of his ""law of accelerating returns"". I guess I'll be reserving judgement until then.

There's alot more I could say (good and bad) about this important book, but the bottom line is that if you frequently find yourself wondering about the role of technology in the future of our species, ""The Singularity is Near"" will give you far more than your money's worth in food for thought.",41
James L Gillaspy,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Some comments that might add to the discussion,"First a personal lament:

I've been reading and enjoying Science Fiction for over fifty years, and I largely blame the idea of the singularity for the present scarcity of good Science Fiction. If, beyond the singularity, humanity is so different as to be essentially unknowable to our present limited minds, then how would an author write about that future?

And why would we want to anyway:

On page 374 of the book,, Kurzweil has a conversation with Bill Gates about silicon intelligence and the pooling of consciousness. Kurzweil seems to believe, in this piece, that we can merge with computers, but still retain our individuality, still be able to withdraw from that merging to remain ""individuals."" That is not consistent with the history of evolution. Our bodies are largely made up of cells whose ancestors were individual, free swimming life forms but now can only survive as part of the greater whole. Is that to be our fate?

As others have said in these reviews, Kurzweil values thought over physicality. But there is more to being human than thought. I, too, live largely in my own mind -- reading, writing, thinking -- but I still value the physical and believe it to be important. I attended a contemporary dance show last night that celebrated human physicality. I don't think that I would enjoy(?) a life where that part of being human no longer existed.

Is there a place for being human in a galaxy wide super intelligence?

I wouldn't mind being smarter, even if that meant implanting computer circuitry in my skull. I wouldn't mind being healthier and living longer, even if that meant injecting me with nano machines. But only if I remain ""human"" and myself throughout the process, and not part of some monolithic whole -- no matter how nebulous the definition of conscious self might be.

Maddewar,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Maddewar,Although a bit eccentric this author has a very good point. His futuristic outlook seems to have merit. Technology is increasing at a very fast pace and I do believe it will increase longevity and improve quality of life.,1
K. P. Badertscher,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,"Too optimistic, too wacky, too wrong.","The full title of this book is ""The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,"" and like its title, the book is verbose and very, very speculative. I know, I know. What should I expect from futurist Ray Kurzweil other than futuristic foo from the future? How about a book with a coherent structure? How about a book that doesn't repeat its fundamental premises multiple times in each chapter? Maybe a book that leaves out a few unsupported theoretical assumptions stated as foregone conclusions? Singularity has a few fascinating passages, some really interesting ideas, and a collection of delightfully eclectic quotes. Sadly, all the good stuff is surrounded by a repetitious screed with nearly as much substance in the footnotes as in the text.

Kurzweil starts off on the wrong foot with some wrong predictions for technological advances to appear ""by the end of the decade."" Given that the book was published in 2005, and as I write this it is 2011, we should be able to fact-check some of these predictions. ""We will have the requisite hardware to emulate human intelligence with supercomputers..."" Nope. ""Computers... will become essentially invisible: woven into our clothing, embedded in our furniture and environment..."" Nuh uh. Yes, lots of smart devices exist now, but wearable computing turned into the smartphone, and pervasive computing isn't all that pervasive. There's also a claim that the Web will become the ""worldwide mesh... once all of its linked devices become communicating web servers...."" The only real approximation of this is botnets, created with malware and harnessed by malcontents. While a few impressive networked computing projects currently exist, most folks still don't give up their CPU's background cycles to anything productive.

After a rocky start predicting the near future, how are we expected to follow along as Kurzweil turns us into plugged-in cyborgs with nanobot blood who can merge and reform our identities at will? One example: virtual reality. Over and over again we are reminded that we will soon be using fully immersive virtual reality. ""By early in the 2nd decade of this century"" we will have fully immersive 3D environments beamed into our eyeballs, and shortly thereafter we will be plugged in using devices that directly stimulate our sense centers in the brain. But who is going to build these environments? Are we doomed to socialize using virtual meeting places as bizarre as Second Life, furries and ambulatory vegetation and penises everywhere you look, only with more fidelity than we can currently imagine and plugged in to our brains? Who wants that?

There's a lot more way-out-there stuff I could bring up from the book, but that's really not its worst failing. The thing that bothered me most about it was the repetition. It's almost as though Kurzweil at some point abandoned a reasoned thesis for truth by repetition. He goes on and on again and again about how we will know the brain's inmost secrets, and how nanobots will solve ecological problems, and how superintelligent sentient machines will treat us wetware humans with respect and care. It's all very Pollyanna, and in some cases more than a little disturbing. Kurzweil's vision of the ultimate goal of humanity is a nanobot swarm with superintelligent AI flying at near the speed of light and colonizing wherever it lands without regard for existing life of any kind. If that's my future, I want out.",18
Richard of Connecticut,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,An Absolute Gem of a Book,"Ray Kurzweil is a national treasure, a man who thinks at the level of Einstein but only 50 years later. There are a number of people like Kurzweil walking around on the planet. You have to search for them. When you find them, try to learn everything you can from them. They will help you move exponentially to the next level. He is a solitary thinker, operating on the outer limits of human knowledge, and then some.

I have read his other books, and in many ways, this book is the sequel to ""The Age of Spiritual Machines"". What Kurzweil is writing about in this book is his belief that we are moving towards s UNION if you will, of human intelligence and machines or objects that will have equal and eventually superior intelligence. Is this the goal of the people who spend their lives working in Artificial Intelligence, probably?

The difference is that Kurzweil knows so much more than his fellow thinkers, and more importantly for us, he has the capacity to convey it to those of us who are not full-time players in his arena. This quality of information conveyance is a vastly underappreciated skill. In my work investing billions of dollars in stock investments, I have access to just about anybody I want, because I have the capacity to write a check. You have no idea how many actual geniuses I deal with who CAN'T speak, let alone write the English language.

Kurzweil is different. He can get these concepts across to us in an interesting language spiced with stories that we can all understand. He does not visibly suffer from the ego needs of most geniuses. He is comfortable in his own skin, and that feeling is conveyed to us also.

Due to his position in the exalted world of the super Mensa types, Kurzweil can also access the top minds of who's doing what in the world today. Men who run Fortune 100 companies are more than willing to share the knowledge of their research departments with this famous thinker.

At the upper levels of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the Defense Department are some of the smartest people on the planet working on Artificial Intelligence, and edge-of-knowledge sophisticated computer applications. Kurzweil is in a position to interact with all of them, and this accounts for why much of what he writes about appears nowhere else.

He also brings something else to the table. He is a very successful inventor and entrepreneur who is now independently wealthy. He knows what works in what environment, and what doesn't. He knows when something is being brought to market too early, or way too late. In the book he states, ""I realized that most inventions fail not because the R&D department can't get them to work, but because the timing is wrong. Inventing is a lot like surfing: you have to anticipate and catch the wave at just the right moment."" I am an investor; I have never heard it said better.

His concept of his ""intuitive linear view of history"" is absolutely fascinating, and compelling. He believes that the rate of change is accelerating. For years we have all heard the concept that the only constant is change. Kurzweil believes the calculus is changing. We have already entered a world where we are witnessing a dramatic change in the rate of acceleration of change.

Just ten or so years ago, cell phones had minimal impact. The Internet was nowhere near the adaptive state it is in today, and universal information flow did not exist. There were no bloggers, traditional media dominated, and people were more easily lied to by politicians with impunity. Things are changing aren't they?

Here's the bottom line on Kurzweil. Most of the time you read a book to take one major thought out of the document. Sometimes it's a single page; sometimes it's a single line. Occasionally, you find that rare book where there is something on every page that is outstanding, motivating, even framework changing. This is such a book, and therein lays its importance.

There's one more reason to read a book like this. Do you remember when Ross Perot ran for President? One of the metaphors he used to refer to was a story of the carpenter he knew. The words were ""Measure twice, cut once."" This is an example of what I call the need to be mentored. There are people that can teach you things that if you spent 20 years studying the topic, you would never learn. The carpenters' of ""Measure twice, cut once,"" is an example of that.

When you read Kurzweil, you are eliminating the need to read hundreds to thousands of other books. There is knowledge on every page for you to absorb and ponder. Buy this book, and have an orgasm of the mind.

Aardvark,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Most important book of the next 50 yrs,"At some point I hope that people will stop paying attention to Paris Hilton and read this book. Our species is at a crossroads and we have some very important decisions to make in the next few decades. This book more than any other will prepare us to make the right choices. Read it now, or be devoured by a swarm of nanobots in 2029 when Skynet takes over.",2
Allen B. Hundley,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,"Which Will Come First, the Singularity or the Discontinuity","Ray Kurzweil is without question one of the greatest technologists of our era and his ideas should command respect. That does not necessarily mean that all of them are correct.

Kurzweil's latest book is a brilliant exposition of one possible future for the human species. As an intellectual adventure it is in the same league with Brian Green's books on string theory and Steven Wolfram's ""A New Kind of Science"". If you enjoy reading Scientific American you can handle Kurzweil. If Discovery magazine is closer to your speed, a more accessible book is ""Radical Evolution"" by Joel Garreau.

People who read books like these basically fall into two groups, those primarily interested in current trends in science and those primarily interested in the future of humanity. Kurzweil attempts to explain both the explosive development of genetics, robotics, and nanotechnology (GRN) and the profound implications these have for the future of our species. The book is worth buying just for its stunning exposition of current trends in GRN.(Actually Garreau's GRIN, for Genetics, Robotics, Information, and Nanotechnology, is a more accurate and therefore better acronym).

Unfortunately, but perhaps not surprisingly, Kurzweil does not adequately take into account events external to the world of technology that could and probably will completely derail his predictions about both GRN and humanity's future. In that sense Kurzweil falls victim to the very same `linear thinking' that he decries in others who forecast the future.

The term `singularity' as used by Kurzweil means the transformation of Homo Sapiens from a slowly evolving biological species to a race of super intelligent beings no longer constrained by the limitations of biology. This transformation will be the result of the confluence of genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics and will occur sometime around 2045.

Descendants of Homo Sapiens live forever because the aging process has been halted. All of the world's economic and social problems disappear because all the baggage of biological evolution (species competition for limited resources, sex, aggression, territorial defense, etc.) vanishes. There is little need to work because intelligent machines do it all, even repairing and replacing themselves when they fail or wear out. The new super beings spend most of their time exploring ever deeper mysteries of the universe.

Kurzweil backs up his extraordinary claims with a wealth of convincing data, in itself a significant contribution, but more important and the reason this book is worth reading, is his exposition of how this confluence could take place. Kurzweil believes firmly it will take place and this is where his linear thinking intrudes.

By linear thinking I mean the idea that tomorrow's technological advancement will follow along the same smoothly upward flowing line that it followed today and yesterday and the day before. If the progress Kurzweil projects for the next four decades were to be compressed into the next five or at most ten years then his forecast could very well turn out to be correct. But in this reviewer's opinion far more powerful and immediate societal forces are at work that will result in a major discontinuity, either natural or manmade.

By discontinuity I mean a collapse of the world economy most likely brought about by terrorist related political and military strife followed by widespread anarchy, certainly lasting many decades and possibly much longer. The GRN technologies are not for backyard inventors working in their garages. They are extremely complex, requiring vast financial, physical, organizational, and intellectual resources. Kurzweil's path to the future depends on a smoothly flowing, surprise free world for the next forty years. Can any thoughtful person reading a newspaper today possibly believe this?

Let N equal the number of Muslims in the world today, roughly one billion. Let N divided by 1,000 (i.e., one tenth of one percent) equal the number of fundamentalist Muslims committed to die for Allah to destroy western civilization. Do the math and that works out to 1,000,000 suicide bombers coming at us daily for the next forty years. Nineteen high school graduates crashed some planes into a couple of buildings in New York and one in Washington, killed three thousand people, and caused a Trillion dollars in damage to the American economy.

Someday the attack will biological or nuclear. It will kill 30,000 or 300,000 or even 3,000,000. No one will know for sure if another is not soon to follow, and another. Uncontrollable mass panic will reign. This civilization risks collapse not because of the buildings destroyed or the numbers killed but because of its extreme fragility due to excessive system interdependence. The collapse could possibly be avoided but the changes required would be profound. It would require too radical a paradigm shift for global elites who cling to the system as it is now.

Kurzweil himself acknowledges that terrorism is the most likely scenario that would prevent the Singularity yet he admits that he has no solution for it. I would recommend that he read ""The Collapse of Complex Societies"" by Joseph Tainter, ""Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed"" by Jared Diamond, and ""The Long Emergency"" by James Howard Kunstler. While these also have some problems in their arguments they point us in the right direction. It would be interesting to see how one of the world's truly great visionaries incorporates the ideas contained in those books into a revised edition of ""The Singularity"".

Civilizations rise and fall. There is no reason to believe that ours is somehow immune to this cycle. One may completely reject the apocalyptic beliefs of fundamentalist Christians, the earth changes of New Agers, and the psychic prognostications of the supermarket tabloids, and still recognize the warning signs that the current civilization cycle may well be nearing an end.

This should not be a cause for despair but rather for hope. At some point a new cycle will begin. Kurzweil's singularity is a cautionary vision of where that next cycle may take us.

We do not know with certainty but the evidence is mounting that probably there are many intelligent species in the universe. Some of them must have progressed beyond our level of development with all its dangers. All we have to do is figure out how they did it.",15

This book is eye-opening in so many ways I can categorically recommend it to any reader.

The 5-star rating reflects the importance of the content. It means if you buy this book, you'll be glad you did five stars' worth. However, the book is too long, and I'd guess not one reader in a thousand can understand all of it. There's science in the book that your average Nobel Laureate would have trouble with, but fortunately the author doesn't require that you understand the science to understand his conclusions.

So buy this book and push through the parts that you don't understand or that you don't find interesting. True, a better writer could make it half as long and twice as clear, but as far as I know that ""better writer"" hasn't yet addressed Kurzweil's subject.

Gaji,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Mind numbingly boring,"I'm an engineer and I could argue against this book's basic premise - that all progress is exponential and therefore, just around the corner we are about to upload our consciousness onto the great-grand-son of my laptop. The simple fact is that all progress is not exponential - the harder the problem, the slower the progress, if at all. Examples: the space program. Prolonging maximum life spans. Genetically engineering medicines. Curing the simple cold (or fighting viruses in general). Progress is sometimes linear. And sometimes, not at all. Just ask all those miserable folks that had the bad luck of living through the Middle Ages.

But never mind that - this book's biggest sin is not the theory it is trying to propagate but the way it does it: it is simply a very, very boring read. The author dives into minute details of the progress being made both in computer science and neuroscience to explain why we are oh-so-close but the story he tells is not compelling. It is organized like a laundry list (prepare to read a lot of bullet items) and it reads just like one. The author spends way too much time trying to quantify the amount of information in the brain for example, without stopping to discuss the impact of the complexity of this information - the fact that human DNA, information wise, fits on a 10 cent data CD, doesn't mean that anyone in any lab has a clue how to create the DNA of a new type of fly, let alone that of a human being.

George F. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,"The future we thought was far off, isn't","As author Ray Kurzweil explains in this best-seller, the technological singularity is the next stage of evolution and will be the merging of human biology and technology. And in his view, it is coming sooner than most people expect -- much sooner. As he writes:

""The key idea underlying the impending Singularity is that the pace of change of our human-created technology is accelerating and its powers are expanding at an exponential pace. Exponential growth is deceptive. It starts out almost imperceptibly and then explodes with unexpected fury -- unexpected, that is, if one does not take care to follow its trajectory.""

The Singularity will mark our advancement to the next stage of evolution, transcending the limitations of our biological bodies and brains. ""By the end of this century, the nonbiological portion of our intelligence will be trillions of trillions of times more powerful than unaided human intelligence.""

Right now we are close to the ""knee of the curve,"" which is to say the exponential nature of technological growth is about to become starkly evident. In a few years the growth will quickly become explosive. ""Before the middle of this century, the growth rates of our technology -- which will be indistinguishable from ourselves -- will be so steep as to appear essentially vertical.""

What may be difficult to realize is that the rate of change itself is exponential, so that in the 100-year span between 2000 and 2099 we will witness roughly twenty thousand years of progress at the 2000 rate.

""If you wonder what will remain unequivocally human in such a world, it's simply this quality: ours is the species that inherently seeks to extend its physical and mental reach beyond current limitations.""

For those new to Ray Kurzweil I suggest reading his Wikipedia entry. A graduate of MIT, he's been a highly successful inventor and entrepreneur, lectures frequently and widely on the future of technology, and is currently head of engineering at Google. He's made many predictions about the future, including the claim in his 1990 best-seller (""The Age of Intelligent Machines"") that a computer would beat the best human chess players by the year 2000. Among the naysayers was world champion Garry Kasparov, who lost to IBM's Deep Blue in 1997. Most of his other predictions have proven true or off only by a few years.

Kurzweil has accumulated a lot of critics over the years, and he conscientiously addresses their concerns in the last chapter. For those who are comfortable with equations he includes a mathematical treatment of the Law of Accelerating Returns in an appendix. And his Notes section includes fascinating narratives along with references to relevant material.

""The Singularity is Near"" is not your average beach read, yet Kurzweil writes so lucidly that most lay readers will find it accessible and stimulating. As an aid to understanding and for pure entertainment value, Kurzweil ends each chapter with a fictional dialogue between various historical figures, himself, and people from the future in which he explains and defends conversationally many of the points raised in his narrative.

Given that most people alive today will likely be around when the exponential curve goes vertical, I strongly recommend this book as a guide to what we might expect.",1
Louis A. Coutts,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Stick to your knitting,"While the author is obviously technically brilliant he ventures into areas about which he appears to know very little. His frequent reference to evoloutionary principles as though they ensure linear progression, is a massive misunderstanding of the concept. He makes one reference to the leader in evolutionary knoweledge over the past three decaseds viz, Stephen Jay Gould and then inaccurately.

It is difficult to believe that he is very conversant with the writings of Jay Gould to whom greater deference ought to have been given when entering into the field of evolution.

In the end I was left with the impression that the book was a cross between science fiction and an unsatisfactory dependency upon his reputation rather than on principles of futurism which suggest (as is the case with mutations in evolution) that it is the unexpected that is likely to call the shots.

Another aspect of the book that concerned me was the assumption that homo sapiens needs to achieve artificial intelligence and that this development will somehow resolve the cultural, religious, environmental and philosophical problems confronting society

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Technophilic ecstacy,"The author is definitely one of the most inspiring of all researchers in the field of applied artificial intelligence. For those, such as this reviewer, who are working ""in the trenches"" of applied AI, his website is better than morning coffee. One does not have to agree with all the conclusions reached by the author in order to enjoy this book, but he does make a good case, albeit somewhat qualitative, for the occurrence, in this century, of what he and other futurists have called a `technological singularity.' He defines this as a period in the future where the rate of technological change will be so high that human life will be `irreversibly transformed.' There is much debate about this notion in the popular literature on AI, but in scientific and academic circles it has been greeted with mixed reviews. Such skepticism in the latter is expected and justified, for scientists and academic researchers need more quantitative justification than is usually provided by the enthusiasts of the singularity, which in this book the author calls ""singularitarians."" Even more interesting though is that the notion of rapid technological change seems to be ignored by the business community, who actually stand to gain (or lose) the most by it.

Since this book is aimed primarily at a wide audience, and not professional researchers, the author does not include detailed arguments or definitions for the notion of machine intelligence or a list of the hundreds of examples of intelligent machines that are now working in the field. Indeed, if one were to include a discussion of each of these examples, this book would swell to thousands of pages. There are machines right now used in business and industry that can manage, troubleshoot, and analyze networks, diagnose illnesses, compose music definitely worth listening to, choreograph dances, simulate human behavior in computer games, recommend and engage in financial transactions and bargaining, and many, many other tasks, a detailed list of which would, again, entail many thousands of pages.

There are various psychological issues that arise when discussing machine intelligence, which if believed might prohibit the acceptance of any kind of notion of a technological singularity. For example, it is one of the historical peculiarities of research in AI that advances in the field are later trivialized, i.e. when a problem in AI becomes solved it no longer holds any mystery and is then considered to be just another part of information processing. It is then no longer regarded as `intelligent' in any sense of the term. This phenomenon in AI research might be called the ""Michie-McCorduck-Hofstader effect"", named after the three individuals, Donald Michie, Barbara McCorduck, and Douglas Hofstader, who discussed it some detail in their writings. If one examines the history of AI, one finds many examples of this effect, such as in knowledge discovery from databases, the use of business rules in database technologies, and the use of ontologies for information systems development. One of the best examples of this effect though is the backgammon player TD-Gammon, a highly sophisticated example of machine intelligence but which is now considered to be merely part of the ""programmer's toolbox."" The Michie-McCorduck-Hofstader effect is important in discussing the notion of a technological singularity since if one does occur this effect would diminish one's ability to recognize it as being real. The author does not name this phenomenon as such in the book, but a reading of it definitely reveals that he is aware of the skepticism expressed by many towards any ""advances"" in machine intelligence.

Another one of these psychological issues regards the attitude of many philosophers on the notion of machine intelligence. In most cases they are extremely skeptical, and many AI researchers seem to feel the need to ""refute"" their opinions on the ""impossibility"" of intelligent machines. Unfortunately the author is one of these, and devotes space in the book to counter various philosophical arguments against AI. His arguments, although valid, are really a waste of time though. Such time would be better spent, both for the author and for AI researchers, in the actual development of intelligent machines. A moratorium should be declared among AI researchers on all philosophical speculation. Such musings are best left to professional philosophers, who have the time and the inclination to indulge themselves in them.

There are other issues that should have been given more attention in the book, such as more details on the energy requirements needed to bring about such a singularity. In addition, the author needs to sharpen just what he means by intelligence and move away from the Turing test/human brain benchmark that he uses in the book. There are many examples of intelligence in the natural world, and these can and have been emulated in many different types of machines. Interestingly, the fixation on human intelligence and the reverse engineering of the human brain (that is exemplified in this book) has inspired a few research teams to attempt to build a machine of ""general intelligence"", i.e. one that can think in many different domains, as clearly humans can. But it is still an open question whether this intelligence is ""entangled"" over these domains, i.e. whether or not a decrease in ability in one domain will affect the ability in another. From an evolutionary or efficiency standpoint it would seem that that domain specific intelligence is more optimal.

The notion of a technological singularity can be met with both exhilaration and a sense of foreboding, since (radical) change can be embraced with enthusiasm and with some feelings of anxiety. Even the author expresses this when he writes in the book that he is not ""entirely comfortable"" with all the consequences of a technological singularity. He has though made a fairly strong case for rapidly accelerating change. If the book concentrated more on the actual examples of intelligent machines and included the enormous amount of data from activities in applied AI that are now going on, an even stronger case could be made.",200

Worldreels,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,TO BE OR NOT TO BE VIRTUAL,"Kurzweil's THE SINGULARITY IS NEAR is an elaboration of his tall tale, THE AGE OF SPIRITUAL MACHINES. What his ideas boil down to is that he can't stand the limitations of being human. From criticism of this new book he can gather the material to write a third book. The title: THOSE WHO ENTER MUST GIVE UP THEIR MINDS.

Does K really think that all the emotions embalmed in love, courtship, marriage, pregnancy, birth and death are just a matter of cps, calculations per second? Is life a mere matter of the barren process of digital & analog cps? Do man's cells operate as mere metaphorical shapes? Does he really believe that dialing up an orgasm in his virtual realm would compare to sex with a real person? Would K admit that his speculations about nano-technology will someday be replaced by speculations about pico-technology or femto-technology? K reminds me a runner who knowing he can't win the race, keeps repeating to himself that he will be the only one who reaches the finish line.

Viewing some popular works of fiction could enable one to comprehend Kurzweil's thesis. In the movie THE MATRIX, a character who portrayed a software program declared, ""when a program loses its purpose it is deleted."" If only there was a delete button to erase Kurzweil's THE SINGULARITY IS NEAR.

Although Kurzweil's post singularity man will obviously be a mutant, he makes no mention of the popular X-MEN comics. He does mention the movie SIMONE and in so doing reveals his hand of cards. Yes, on screen, one can become another person but when the producer of Simone was forced to bring her off the screen he had to fake her by finding a real live double. In this same way, everything Kurzweil asserts and projects about future man will have to be faked when he tries to bring it off the pages of his fictional story.

Reflecting on Philip K. Dick's movie, BLADERUNNER, may have enabled Kurzweil to escape the casket he encased himself in. What will happen when his Ray One and Ray Two, or having an army of multiple Rays, produces pure chaos. If Ray One was human, Ray Two would have to be called a copy, much like an android copy. In BLADERUNNER the character Tyrell's replicants, the brilliant Nexus Six Androids, exceeded human cps or capacity but were, therefore, given only a four year life span. The common sense way Dick allowed the story's characters to distinguish copy from original, was with an eye scan device that measured human emotions. In Kurzweil's story there is no built in safe guards to distinguish Ray One from Ray Two, or Ray Three, or Ray Four, etc. In other words, Dick went far beyond, put much deeper thought into and provided a sense of sanity for his story. This is something K could never do because he couldn't view his material as fiction.

The most absurd of K's proposals is to reverse engineer the brain. It represents the desperate hope of making the arrow of time flow backwards. If, as everyone concedes, the brain's output and even time itself is in flux, is bathed in quantum uncertainty, there is no way that a nanosecond snapshot will capture a total picture of this flux. This freeze frame of the mind, either uploaded or downloaded, will never capture the whole picture. Of course, K doesn't mind stopping cold the genetic mutations that fuel evolution, since he will replace evolution with his own godless nanobots.",9
Daniel Higgins,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Annoying,"This book is annoying. The basic premise is that technology is not only moving forward, but that it's in fact accelerating and then assumes that it will continue to accelerate forever and discusses the implications of this. The author claims that humanity is on the verge of some unspecified and as of yet unimagined technological breakthrough that will forever alter life as we know it. If, like me, you happen to have a shred of skepticism about this initial claim then you will find this book tiresome since the author takes this enormous assumption and runs with it for the rest of the book without putting much effort into convincing you why this is a good assumption. A lot of it comes off as shear fantasy",3
Scott Piper,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Age of Spiritual Machines was Kurzweil's best,"""The Age of Spiritual Machines"" (Kurzweil's previous book) I thought was a great optimistic book about the future. ""The Singularity is Near"" is too optimistic. It just lists niche technologies that Kurzweil thinks will change the world, even if the technologies aren't technically sound. I stopped reading when Kurzweil discussed a perpetual motion machine which he believed could and will exist.",24
Klaus Stiefel,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,The singularity is far,"This book is very well known, and the question how many of the rather rapidly advancing technological trends will continue and how they will influence humanity's future is a very interesting one. So I bought the book and read it. I found it much, much weaker than I had anticipated it to be.

Ray Kurzweil wrote a thick volume combining 50's style naive technology-optimism, uncritical extrapolation of current trends (especially, but not only, Moore's law) and somewhat-more-than-half knowledge of biology. He assembles all of that into his own personal pseudo-religion, and even uses a terminology that sounds very religious (He calls himself a ""singulatarian""). According to Kurzweil, all will be well: hunger, disease, aging and even death will be eradicated once we fuse with computers and have nano-robots populate our bloodstreams. Even wars will be less bloody - he includes a graph of declining US war deaths over time, conveniently ignoring the numbers of foreign human beings killed by the US in these wars.

In most cases, his arguments are not very sound, in my opinion. One problem is that he strongly believes that all the current technological trends will continue to accelerate, disregarding physical boundaries and resource constraints. Often his argument goes as in: X has been achieved. Therefore XX is maybe, theoretically possible, said some expert. Once we have XX, we will be able to achieve YY. Hence, YY is about to become reality within a decade.

In my own field, neurobiology, he mistakes models (intellectual tools to explain certain aspects of a phenomenon) with complete, reverse engineered, functional reproductions of neural systems. There are certainly good models out there, but no neural structure has so far been reverse engineered, not even close.

Always suspicious: the use of quotations of old or dead wise men to cover up the lack of content in a book. Just because someone managed to look up what Ein- or Wittgenstein once said, that does not make his arguments stronger, does it? But, it leaves the reader in this aura of just having being confronted with the words of these intellectual giants, and some of that must rub off to what the author had to say, no? Kurzweil wins Olympic gold in name-dropping with ""The singularity is near"", where there are rarely less than three quotations in front of a chapter, and whole chapters are only made up of quotations, nothing else!

This is in fact a rather involuntarily interesting book. Why does a member of the US upper class come up with a technology based salvation story? I think what we have here is an extremely interesting fusion of the American believe in the power of technology to solve problems with the strong US religious tradition.",144
John St John,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,Brave New World,"To say that Mr. Kurzweil is a bit of an optimist is like saying Shaq is a bit on the tall side. Mr K is positively bubbling with enthusiasim. Had it not been taken by Joe Namath a suitable title might have been ""The Future's So Bright I Just Gotta Wear Shades"". But therein lies the problem. Mr K comes across more like a passionate evangelical than a reasoned scientist. Whenever someone is absolutley convinced about the rightness of his assumptions I become skeptical.

If you're reading this you know the premise of the book. Mr. K maintains that the pace of technological change (and by technology he means the really cool technologies, like infotech, biotech, and nanotech) is not simply increasing, but increasing exponentially, so fast that we will soon reach a point where man and machine have become one, and are brains are a million (or maybe a billion) times more powerful. When this happens everything we know will have changed forever.

Moreover, this is not someting that will happen at some vague time in the far future. It's just around the corner. Mr. K even gives us a date: 2045.

While reading the book I kept thinking, What if Mr. K had written this in the mid 1950's? Certainly he'd have backup for his basic premise--the changes that occured in the first half of the 20th century were indeed tremendous. Take aviation, a hot technology in those days. Mr. K would no doubt have observed that we went from Kitty Hawk to the Boeing 707 in just 50 years. Projecting ahead, Mr. K would have concluded that the second half of the century would see an even greater rate of advancement, so that by now we'd all have our own personal flying devices, zipping off to Europe in just minutes.

But that hasn't happened. Certainly there has been signigicant progress in aviation in the last 50 years, but not like the 50 years before that. In some says it's worse. I suspect that since 9/11 the time it takes to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco (from the time you get to one airport to the time you leave the other) may be longer now than it was in the 1950's.

Why has this happened? A lot of this has to do with social conditions, not technological ones. Supersonic trasport never got off the ground (so to speak) in part because people didn't want the sonic booms near populated areas. These same social factors may well put the brakes on a lot of what Mr. K predicts.

It's not that Mr. K's book isn't based on hard science. It's positively larded with science, so much so that my eyes tended to glaze over many times. It's just that he doesn't seem very critical. While he does acknowledge the existence of contrary opinion, he quickly (albeit politely) dismisses any cautionary thoughts. Those who disagree with his beliefs are clearly stuck-in-the-mud, nay-saying Luddites.

Mr K is obviously a brilliant, well-informed scientist. I don't have enough knowledge to judge the accuracy of his facts, except in a few situations. When that does occur, though, I become unimpressed. For example, he spends a few pages talking about the increases that have occured in life expectancy, and uses this to project further increases to 150 years and then to 500 years. But he fails to distinguish between life exoectancy and life span. The former has indeed increased, but the latter has not. I am certain Mr. K knows the difference. His failure to make the distinction is misleading and disingenuous. It makes me wonder about the veracity of the rest of the book.

As to the book itself, it's far too long. He repeats his points so much it seems as though he thinks that by mere repetition the reader will become more convinced that he's right. And some parts of the book are simply annoying, like the smug pseudo-conversations among past, present, and future personages that appear throughout the work.

To his credit, though, his optimisim about the future is refreshing, and certainly an antidote to the dystopian views typical in literature and Hollywood (Brave New World, 1984, Blade Runner, Mad Max, The Terminator, Waterworld, etc.).

The bottom line here is that Mr. K. doesn't seem to remember that virtually all predictions about the future are wrong, since the predictions are simply extrapolations of current trends. The future is never what we think it will be, and Mr. K is no exception.

Then again, he could be right. If so, I just hope I can live long enough to enjoy the sigularity, so I can have my body filled with nanobots and my brain uploaded to (as he would say) a suitable substrate. Maybe being a cyborg won't be so bad.",292
Doctor Whom,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,"Idolatry is the worship of a human product as divine. Kurzweil is techno-idolator in chief, and a traitor to the human race.","RK believes that a complete mathematical model of brain function would be tantamount to a human being. Attentive viewers of Netflix's ""Hemlock Grove"" know better; modeling the brain function of a dysmorphic human for instantiation in another, perfect body -- a wonderful plot device -- can't actually transplant personal subjectivity, as the about to be terminated dysmorphette realizes.
Objective science requires reproducible and therefore predictable results. Otherwise, one could not predict the sunrise or know where a drone will strike. Subjectivity -- our emotional sense of self -- is unique, which means it is exactly what cannot be reproduced. Objectivity therefore tries to eliminate subjectivity, aka prejudice from its results. Subjectivity is a singularity in the minds of objectivists, detestable evidence of discontinuity in the universe, as if it were the equivalent of dividing by zero.
Confusing math with human identity is utter arrogance. Among the consequences of this technological idolatry is the reaction of Islamists against Western education, and the Tea Potty against evidence of climate change.

Robert David STEELE Vivas,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,"Technically brilliant, culturally constrained","Ray Kurzweil is unquestionably the most brilliant guru for the future of information technology, but Joel Garreau's book Radical Evolution: The Promise and Peril of Enhancing Our Minds, Our Bodies -- and What It Means to Be Human covers the same ground, with the same lack of soul, but more interesting and varied detail.

This is really four booklets in one: a booklet on the imminence of exponential growth within information technologies including genetics, nano-technology, and robotics; a booklet on the general directions and possibilities within each of these three areas; a booklet responding to critics of his past works; and lengthy notes. All four are exceptional in their detail, but somewhat dry.

I was disappointed to see no mention of Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization and just one tiny reference to Stewart Brand (co-evolution) in a note. Howard Rheingold (virtual reality) and Tom Atlee (collective intelligence) go unmentioned. It is almost as if Kurzweil, who is surely familiar with these ""populist"" works, has a disdain for those who evaluate the socio-cultural implications of technology, rather than only its technical merits.

This is an important book, but it is by a nerd for nerds. [Sorry, but anyone who takes 250 vitamin supplements and has a schedule of both direct intravenous supplements and almost daily blood testing, is an obsessive nerd however worthy the cause.] It assumes that information technologies, growing exponentially, will solve world hunger, eliminate disease, replenish water, create renewable energy, and allow all of us to have the bodies we want, and to see and feel in our mates the bodies they want. All of this is said somewhat blandly, without the socio-cultural exploration or global evaluation that is characteristic of other works by reporters on the technology, rather than the technologists themselves.

The book is, in short, divorced from the humanities and the human condition, and devoid of any understanding of the pathos and pathology of immoral governments and corporations that will do anything they can to derail progress that is not profitable. It addresses, but with cursory concern, most of the fears voiced by various critics about run-away machines and lethal technologies that self-replicate in toxic manners to the detriment of their human creators.

The book is strongest in its detailed discussion of both computing power and draconian drops in needed energy for both computing and for manufacturing using new forms of computing. The charts are fun and helpful. The index is quite good.

I put the book down, after a pleasant afternoon of study, with several feelings.

First, that I should give Joel Garreau higher marks for making this interesting, and recommend that his book be bought at the same time as this one.

Second, that there is an interesting schism between the Kurzweil-Gates gang that believes they can rule the world with machines; and the Atlee-Wheatley gang that believes that collective **human** intelligence, with machines playing a facilitating but not a dominant role, is the desired outcome.

Third that there really are very promising technologies with considerable potential down the road, but that government is not being serious about stressing peaceful applications--the author is one of five advisors to the U.S. military on advanced technologies, and it distresses me that he supports a Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA) that focuses on making war rather than peace--imagine if we applied the same resources to preventing war and creating wealth?

Fourth, information technologies are indeed going to change the balance of power among nations, states, and neighborhoods--on balance, based on his explicit cautions, I predict a real estate collapse in the over-priced major cities of the US, and a phenomenal rise of high-technology villages in Costa Rica and elsewhere.

The singularity may be near, as the author suggests, but between now and then tens of millions more will die. Technology in isolation is not enough--absent broad ethical context, it remains primarily a vehicle for nerds to develop and corporations to exploit. As I told an internal think session at Interval in the 1990's (""GOD, MAN, & INFORMATION:. COMMENTS TO INTERVAL IN-HOUSE"". Tuesday, 9 March 1993"" can use as a Yahoo search) until our technologies can change the lives of every man, woman, and child in the Third World, they are not truly transformative. This book hints at a future that may not be achieved, not for lack of technology, but for lack of good will.

EDIT of 24 Oct 05: Tonight I will review James Howard Kunstler's The Long Emergency: Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century His bottom line is that cheap oil underlies all of our surburban, high-rise, mega-agriculture, and car-based mobility, and that the end of cheap oil is going to have catastrophic effects on how we live, driving much of the country into poverty and dislocation, with the best lives being in those communities that learn to live with local agriculture and local power options. Definitely the opposite of what Kurzweil sees, and therefore recommended as a competing viewpoint.

EDIT of 12 Dec 07: ethics is something I have thought about a lot, and my first public article outside the intelligence community was entitled ""E3i: Ethics, Ecology, Evolution, & Intelligence: An Alternative Paradigm for *National* Intelligence."" It must be something about engineers. Neither the author of this book, nor the Google Triumverate, seem to grasp the moral implications of technology run amuk without respect for ethics, privacy, copyright, humanity, etc. This is one reason I admire E. O. Wilson so much--the first of his works that I read, Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, answered the question: ""Why do the sciences need the humanities?"" The second, The Future of Life, answered the question, ""What is the cost and how do we save the planet?"" Science had little to do with the latter. The two authors are poles apart.",692
D. Kittrell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people,Good introduction to the topic,"An excellent introductory text.. While it won't replace formal, traditional, approaches to the subject this is near perfect if you're looking for a quick overview covering key algorithms, Big-O notation and its implications for various approaches, low-math and minimal jargon, and a bit of fun. The illustrations and diagrams are hand-drawn and well-suited to the content style (as well as being clear and simple to follow). If you're looking for a formal introduction or an academic approach this isn't the book for you but it gets the job done as a solid introductory text. I try to keep up with books on a variety of CS/Dev subjects both for myself and to check out new texts for others; this one I'll be highly recommending.

Let's hope the author keeps this up with a ""Grokking"" series covering other CS/Dev topics.

BTW, the book includes an insert with a code for a free e-book version. I overlooked that on first reading; it's a nice addition if you want to add a portable electronic copy for quick reference.",17

A. Krueger,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people,The best algorithms and data structures book for those without a computer science background.,"If you are new to data structures and algorithms, I guarantee that you find this book a helpful resource with a single caveat: make sure you are the target audience.

From the author:

""Who should read this book?

This book is aimed at anyone who knows the basics of coding and wants to understand algorithms. Maybe you already have a coding problem and are trying to find an algorithmic solution. Or maybe you want to understand what algorithms are useful for. Here’s a short, incomplete list of people who will probably find this book useful:

• Hobbyist coders
• Coding boot camp students
• Computer science grads looking for a refresher
• Physics/math/other grads who are interested in programming""

In my opinion, the reason this book is so much better than traditional resources on the subject is that the author adheres to a few basic principles that I find fundamental to learning.

From the author:

""About this book

This book is designed to be easy to follow. I avoid big leaps of thought. Any time a new concept is introduced, I explain it right away or tell you when I’ll explain it. Core concepts are reinforced with exercises and multiple explanations so that you can check your assumptions and make sure you’re following along.

I lead with examples. Instead of writing symbol soup, my goal is to make it easy for you to visualize these concepts. I also think we learn best by being able to recall something we already know, and examples make recall easier. So when you’re trying to remember the difference between arrays and linked lists (explained in chapter 2), you can just think about getting seated for a movie. Also, at the risk of stating the obvious, I’m a visual learner. This book is chock-full of images.

The contents of the book are carefully curated. There’s no need to write a book that covers every sorting algorithm—that’s why we have Wikipedia and Khan Academy. All the algorithms I’ve included are practical. I’ve found them useful in my job as a so ware engineer, and they provide a good foundation for more complex topics.""

The book starts with simple concrete examples and then moves towards abstraction. Most books on the subject start with abstract mathematical equations (symbol soup as the author calls it) and then move towards concrete implementations (or just stay with abstract proofs). That is approach is completely backwards to me, but perhaps it works well for others.",10

The author's enthusiasm shines through, and helps to motivate the reader as well. I believe there are some minor bugs here and there, however, in the Python source code. For example, in the binary search source code early in the book (on page 9, I believe), the calculation of the variable ""mid"" neglects to divide the sum of ""high"" and ""low"" by 2 - readers would do well to keep their eyes open to this when actually entering the source code into their machines!

J,1.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people,Incoherent & Repetitive Filler,"This ""Grokking Algorithms"" book reads like the scattered & jittery ramblings of somebody with a severe attention deficit hurriedly scribbling random notes & sketches while on a potently large dose of caffeine.

The book has more prefacing, recapping, self-referencing, & distracting/irrelevant filler than actual substance pertaining to algorithms. I found the very little (attempt at) actual substance within the book so scrambled & clumsily explained as to be nearly incomprehensible. If the excessively redundant filler & nonsense was eliminated, all that would remain might be barely enough for a bad blog post rather than an entire book.

One could attribute some of this mess to the individual writer's quirky ""style,"" but no competent book editor or publisher of learning materials should have approved this & permitted its publication for sale - especially at such a high retail price. The many (suspicious?) overwhelmingly positive reviews here fooled me into hoping that this book would be a good entry point to learn more about algorithms - WRONG. I will avoid purchasing anything again from this publisher (Manning) or this author (Aditya Bhargava).",9
mikarv,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning From Data,"Not only a great machine learning textbook, but a role-model for any technical tome","This is an incredibly well thought out book. It is gripping, easy to understand, and keeps you following the mathematics without patronising you. The authors are experts in well-placed visuals to illustrate tricky concepts — visuals they must have spent a lot of time conceiving, designing and developing.

Many scholars forget how difficult it was to learn what they know understand well, and as a result communicate it poorly. They may even feel that confusion and immersion are 'rites of passage'. Abu-Mostafa and colleagues seem to greatly dislike this approach, perhaps even feeling that it is an excuse for poor educational resources. Instead set out to make a top-rate learning experience, and fill a significant machine learning gap. The book is even humorous at times, which contributes greatly to bonding with students. They have certainly succeeded in their ambitions.

Those on the textbook writing road, even if they aren't seeking to learn from data, could learn much from this stellar pedagogical work.",3

Just enough of the required math is used to explain the theory along with word description of what is going on.
It avoids the convoluted gobbly-gook you see in technical papers that makes things impossible to follow
for the average engineer.

The book concisely lays things out step by step though you have to put effort to follow it.
The goal of this book is to give the reader a solid foundation for further study on machine learning.
This book is not a cookbook on how to implement machine learning.

Clearly this book is the first edition as there are additional e-chapters posted on additional topics
which will most likely be included in a future edition of this book. The book will show you how to access the additional chapters.
On the back cover it says ""This is a short course, not a hurried course."" And this is true.
It is short because things are concisely presented. However, it is not hurried as I needed a lot of time to digest it.

You'll need to know some multivariable calculus and linear algebra to follow along, and some programming skills to do
some of the exercises in the book.

Overall an excellent intro to machine learning.",1

Nom de Plume,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning From Data,Very impressive!,"This book is a phenomenal resource. It might very well be in a league of its own. In my opinion there are a handful of machine learning books that I've come across that really stand out from the rest: Introduction to Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani), Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshiani), Applied Predictive Modeling (Kuhn, Johnson), Python Machine Learning (Raschka), and then this book. I've also heard great things about Machine Learning: A Probabilisitc Perspective (Murphy) and Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop), though I haven't yet read those texts. ISL, APM, and PML each are terrific with a blend of theoretical but mostly geared towards practical applications. ESL is more focused on theory and a deep understanding of the math behind the algorithms/functions (i.e. how do they work, which is essential for understanding when to apply which algorithm). This text is different in that it's more focused on the problem of learning: is learning possible? how do we learn? and how do we learn well? This is an essential foundation that everyone in the field needs to have.

The text is impressive in and of itself; however, what really makes this book stand out is that the authors have set up a website dedicated to the text with a blog, dynamic e-chapters (covering NN, SVM, Similarity Methods, Linear Algebra, and various techniques to aid in learning (i.e. dimension reduction)). Its much like a virtual classroom where you may ask questions regarding the book or anything ML in general and other reviewers and the text authors are there to answer your questions. There are very high quality videos (lectures) along with slides for each chapter. Thus, when you buy the text you gain access to each of these resources (lectures are free on YouTube whether you purchase the book or not). ISL also has its own course online with lecture videos (which can be found on YouTube). I would say that anyone who is starting out in the field needs these two texts: LFD and ISL. From each you get your theory and practical foundations along with lectures and learning resources. The back of the book also contains a very comprehensive dictionary of notations used throughout the book.",5

test12345,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning From Data,Learning From Data: A Great Crash Course on Machine Learning,"Learning From Data by Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa et al is good intro to both a theoretical and practical approach to understanding modeling. Let’s make things clear, this is a textbook – not a passive read. At about 200 pages, it on the slim side for a textbook, but as the authors note in the preface, the book is “a short course, not a hurried course”.

Complexity:
Despite not having much modeling experience, the book was relatively easy for me to understand, although some of it did go over my head. It is a very good choice as an introduction to the field. The authors do an incredible job of weaving narrative into the knowledge early on, although this becomes less common later in the book. By that I mean most sections contain examples relating the topic to real life applications which prevents the math from becoming too abstract. And there is a good amount of math. Before reading this book, I would recommend having taken multivariable calculus since they use gradients and other things fairly frequently. If you have taken enough math but think you are a bit rusty the book takes care of that. The authors have been kind enough to include a “Table of Notation” at the back of the book to let you refresh yourself if you come across an unfamiliar symbol. So if you forget what a downward pointing triangle means, there is still hope for you!

Chapter 1: The Learning Problem.
In this chapter the authors provide the basic background to learning from data. As stated earlier, this is where they do some of their best work connecting the theory to real life examples. The writing style in some of these examples is almost like prose which makes it a much more enjoyable and memorable read. They summarize some of the main types of learning and define some of the key terms and principles like error and noise.

Chapter 2: Training versus Testing.
This chapter begins to explain what the theory of generalization is, the associated error, and numerical approximations of generalizations. I would still categorize this chapter as background knowledge that will be used more in later parts of the book.

Chapter 3: The Linear Model.
This is really the meat of the book. If you want to quickly learn how to do a regression then jump straight to this chapter. It covers both linear and logistic regression and also touches on nonlinear transformations.

Chapter 4: Overfitting.
This chapter deals with the more advanced aspects of modeling. As the authors put it “the ability to deal with overfitting is what separates professionals from amateurs”. While I can safely say that I am still an amateur, it was nice to be exposed to some of the more advanced concerns of the field. Overfitting, for those who don’t know, is trying to fit to the data more than is needed. This is often done by using more degrees of freedom than necessary to make a model i.e. making a 10th order approximation of data whose original function is actually only 2nd order. To someone new to modeling it can be very tempting to increase the order of an approximation because it might seem that higher order = higher accuracy. This section of the book does a good job of explaining how that isn’t the case by introducing the idea of an overfit penalty, the increase in error from overfitting a curve.

Chapter 5: Three Learning Principles.
This chapter is different. Very different. Instead of continuing to introduce other types of models, the authors decide to use the fundamentals taught in earlier chapters to talk about three key principles that are useful in modeling: Occam’s razor, sampling bias, and data snooping. Occam’s razor is something that is well-known. The book uses Albert Einstein’s explanation of the term, “An explanation of the data should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.” This relates to the previous chapter’s problem of overfitting. Sampling bias talks about errors in modeling that come from having data that is not representative of the overall population. Data snooping talks about deciding to make a prediction after looking at data rather than before. This section was probably the most interesting to read. Unlike the previous few chapters the authors return to relying on real world examples. They even use the historical example of the false prediction of the 1948 US presidential election between Truman and Dewey. Again this makes the information in this chapter much more memorable and was by far my favorite chapter of the book.

Problems/Exercises:
I only briefly skimmed over a few of the exercises and problems included in this book but they did help improve my understanding of the topics. According to the authors the provided practice problems are “easy” so if you want more of a challenge you will need to look elsewhere.

Criticisms:
In the middle chapters of the book, the authors use fewer real world examples and prose style writing. This is extremely unfortunate because, to someone unfamiliar with the field, it provided a hook to draw you into the more math heavy sections. Also, while the authors are very detailed and thorough in explaining different theories and types of models, they do not do a great job of listing the strengths and weaknesses of each. If I was required to make one of the models explained in this book, I probably could, but if I was asked to choose which model would be best for a given situation I would probably be unable to do so. They should have been clearer about what models are used in different situations and provided guidelines for selecting which model to use (beyond Occam’s razor). This would better connect the material to real world use and be more beneficial to the readers.

Conclusion:
Learning From Data provided a quick but thorough overview of modeling and machine learning. If you would like to learn more about the subject and have the required math background, it is a very good place to start. It will give you the background, main models, errors, and principles necessary for you to not only learn the language of the field but also critique and even create your own models. I highly recommend it.

If you're like me, you've avoided the theory and only wanted to dig into specific algorithms, but at some point you need the theory and the best-practices. This book provides these, and it is very accessible. The online lectures are excellent as well, and are nice when you just want to review.

Cygnids,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning From Data,Perfect Learning!,"If you are a beginner in ML, buy this book! If you have a quantitative background and are planning to dabble in ML, buy the book. I fall in the latter category, but am a ML novice; and recently, started to learn through ML books and online resources. Until recently, I couldn't quite build a mental framework within which to view and place ML approaches, justifications, performance, etc., nor could I quite contrast ML against ""classical"" data analysis approaches (oh well, why can't I just fit the data, and carefully deal with interpolation/extrapolation matters, etc. etc.). As I explored the subject through other texts & online material, largely, it seemed a choppy sea of techniques flotsam, a confusing landscape of differing terminology, and, I couldn't quite ""put my finger"" on the subject, nor could I conceive a framework to view the ML approach. And then, fortuitously, I came across this book! I believe it provides a much needed principled approach to the subject, introducing intuitive terminology, suggesting a line of thought through sequencing of material, and systematically covering the core essentials; all this, in a manner that nicely balances readability & mathematical rigor. After a quick read, I do have a mental framework to place ML developments (and no doubt, it will get tweaked & refined over time). Since I'm a novice, I risk being shot down for making such bold statements, however, I suspect I'm probably not far from the truth in saying that there is a need for such an expository text. I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't a ton of other ML beginners who are as appreciative of this book, as I am. Thank you for this wonderful book!

Incidentally, the authors also provide a free online course covering the material in the text, and a few additional topics covering the basics of neural networks, SVMs, kernel methods, and the use of RBFs.

I would highly recommend reading this book in conjunction with Prof. Abu-Mostafa's video lectures on You Tube. The book comes to life after hearing his lectures. The complex subject almost seems simple (!) and I've spent hours totally spellbound at the sheer lucidity of his video lectures.

The lectures and the book track each other quite well. Prof. Abu-Mostafa teaches SVMs and a few other topics in his lectures on You Tube but they are, unfortunately, not covered in the book. Perhaps a newer edition of the book would include them?

One may think that this book is a bit thin in terms of its contents. To me it is important to know why I am doing certain things rather than to know what are the possible things I can do. This book is along the line of why, where and of course how we use machine learning, and provides tools whenever necessary, without sacrificing mathematical rigor. It is meant to be a short course as the title says. Even if you have read other books on machine learning, reading this book is worthwhile; at the least, it will revitalize your interest in the subject and give you a clear(er) perspective.

My guess is that subsequent editions of the book will be 'fleshed' out with these additional materials. Once the next edition comes out, hopefully with the chapters on SVM, neural networks, and other methods, this will be a much more comprehensive book.

The ML techniques which are very well explained in the book are those related with linear or linearized (through nonlinear transformations) models (linear regression and classification, perceptron, use of gradient in minimization,...), although in the Caltech's course Neural Network and SVM models and techniques have been very well presented.

The models taught in the book serve as test beds for treating the perennial problems: when is learning possible? How to overcome data noise, sampling bias, overfitting and data snooping issues in practical situations? These fundamental concerns are transverse to all ML models and techniques. These are the matters where this book shines.

The book is high-quality (nice paper and color pictures), and is sold at a very low price: it is a must-have for ML wizards :-) (and wannabees).",1

Marc W. Abel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning From Data,A great book if Eout(g) ~ Ein(g),"I can't pretend to have spent nearly as much time with this book as I've signed up to. It arrived this afternoon, and it got at least 20 minutes of my time looking ahead at what Professor Abu-Mostafa is going to say to the world tomorrow. But from page 15 to 27, here is what I can observe.

A minor point: I love the color examples within the book. When I was in school, we didn't get textbooks like this.

The tone of the text is very sympathetic in the direction of one who is interested in the subject. That is, if you need to learn from data, the text considers what you will need to know to succeed. The reader's need to understand is prioritized much higher than the reader's need to ""be educated"".

Although I've been out of college for two decades, I have no problem following what the text has to say, or the direction it's headed in. I don't abstract things magnificently, my calculus isn't that hot, and I slid through school without a probability class as such. I love math, but I'm not a powerhouse at it compared to the peers who once sat next to me. But I can follow this text, understand the exercises, and I conjecture that I can work the problems which are meant to be worked.

For a non-academic, I have considerable on-the-ground machine learning background. I've done a lot of backpropagation network training in my day in character recognition, acoustics, finance, and similar disciplines. This is where I find the text valuable: it can build on what I already know, and it starts in a place I'm already familiar with. So if this is your field or one of your fields, the book will make not just a good textbook but a useful reference.

So let's talk about what this book is not, and perhaps AMLbook will publish something else for us. Don't expect a course in neural networks here. They're not in the table of contents (""hmmm...""), but you'll find them in the index pointing you to the epilogue. Support vector machines get the same treatment. Now support vector machines are a little new for me; they came into their own after I finished college. Neural networks, however, got an earlier start.

What I can say is that this text is intentionally tool-neutral. I just read 13 pages that weren't about neural networks per se, but they covered vital groundwork that I learned via hands-on experience with real neural networks. My grasp of some of the ""why"" components of what I know is already improved.

I am not in love with whatever chemical processes went into the manufacture of this book. Perhaps it came off the press so recently that I'm noticing that, and the effects will fade. For right now, it's a definite don't-cuddle-with volume which drives me to the bathroom sink when I put it down. I can live with this; it's a small price to pay for the knowledge.

The amount I paid for this text was astonishingly low. No doubt the authors have thought this through carefully, but this text will hold its own against others that cost three to six times what I paid.

I apologize if this is not the best-informed review. I'm hitting send a little early, because at the present time, you don't have many alternatives to read.",12

I'm giving this 4 stars because it is indeed a short course on learning from data as the cover says. This is not an in-depth book on learning algorithms although it does of course cover some of these in reasonable depth but always from a computer science angle towards the theory of learning rather than in a practical applied 'engineering' light. The book and the online course itself is actually of very high quality (despite being free); the professor's lectures are very well structured, organised and explained.

Book Shark,4.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,"Fascinating, Disappointing but Ultimately Enlightening","How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed by Ray Kurzweil

""How to Create a Mind"" is a very interesting book that presents the pattern recognition theory of mind (PRTM), which describes the basic algorithm of the neocortex (the region of the brain responsible for perception, memory, and critical thinking). It is the author's contention that the brain can be reverse engineered due to the power of its simplicity and such knowledge would allow us to create true artificial intelligence. The one and only, futurist, prize-winning scientist and author Ray Kurzweil takes the reader on a journey of the brain and the future of artificial intelligence. This enlightening 352-page book is composed of the following eleven chapters: 1. Thought Experiments on the World, 2. Thought Experiments on Thinking, 3. A Model of the Neocortex: The Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind, 4. The Biological Neocortex, 5. The Old Brain, 6. Transcendent Abilities, 7. The Biologically Inspired Digital Neocortex, 8. The Mind as Computer, 9. Thought Experiments on the Mind, 10. The Law of Accelerating Returns Applied to the Brain, and 11. Objections.

Positives:
1. Well researched and well-written book. The author's uncanny ability to make very difficult subjects accessible to the masses.
2. A great topic in the ""mind"" of a great thinker.
3. Great use of charts and diagrams.
4. A wonderful job of describing how thinking works.
5. Thought-provoking questions and answers based on a combination of sound science and educated speculation.
6. The art of recreating brain processes in machines. ""There is more parallel between brains and computers than may be apparent."" Great stuff!
7. Great information on how memories truly work.
8. Hierarchies of units of functionality in natural systems.
9. How the neocortex must work. The Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind (PRTM). The main thesis of this book. The importance of redundancy. Plenty of details.
10. Evolution...it does a brain good. Legos will never be the same for me again.
11. The neocortex as a great metaphor machine. Projects underway to simulate the human brain such as Markram's Blue Brain Project.
12. Speech recognition and Markov models. Author provides a lot of excellent examples.
13. The four key concepts of the universality and feasibility of computation and its applicability to our thinking.
14. A fascinating look at split-brain patients. The ""society of mind."" The concept of free will, ""We are apparently very eager to explain and rationalize our actions, even when we didn't actually make the decisions that led to them."" Profound with many implications indeed.
15. The issue of identity.
16. The brain's ability to predict the future. The author's own predictive track record referenced.
17. The laws of accelerating returns (LOAR), where it applies and why we should train ourselves to think exponentially.
18. The author provides and analyzes objections to his thesis. In defense of his ideas. Going after Allen's ""scientist's pessimism.""
19. The evolution of our knowledge.
20. Great notes and links beautifully.

Negatives:
1. The book is uneven. That is, some chapters cover certain topics with depth while others suffer from lack of depth. Some of it is understandable as it relates to the limitations of what we currently know but I feel that the book could have been reformatted into smaller chapters or subchapters. The book bogs down a little in the middle sections of the book.
2. Technically I disagree with the notion that evolution always leads to more complexity. Yes on survival but not necessarily on complexity.
3. The author has a tendency to cross-market his products a tad much. It may come across as look at me...
4. A bit repetitive.
5. Sometimes leaves you with more questions than answers but that may not be a bad thing...
6. No formal separate bibliography.

In summary, overall I enjoyed this book. Regardless of your overall stance on the feasibility of artificial intelligence no one brings it like Ray Kurzweil. His enthusiasm and dedication is admirable. The author provides his basic thesis of how the brain works and a path to achieve true artificial intelligence and all that it implies. Fascinating in parts, bogs down in other sections but ultimately satisfying. I highly recommend it!

Holygrail,3.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,Interesting but too much filler content,"The first part of the book explains a modern theory on how the brain works, based on repetition of a basic structure in the brain that works as a pattern recognizer, and how this pattern recognition is a recursive function that creates intelligence and ultimately what we are. It seems to be similar to the one put forward in the book ""On intelligence"" by Jeff Hawkins, which Kurzweil references. I honestly don't know how well accepted this theory is within neuroscience circles but I found this part really interesting and the explanation very well written.

Of course the main thing is that if this theory is true, the brain does look like a structure very amenable to eventual simulation in a different substrate, which is what Ray Kurzweil's work is ultimately about. It is after all a recursive structure composed of relatively simple units... exactly like computer programs! Or, more accurately, like some AI constructs like hidden markov models, which Kurzweil pretty much dedicates the rest of the book to. This is the part I have a problem with. The book is called ""how to create a mind"", but after explaining (superficially) how the mind (supposedly) works, it just describes some vaguely similar structures that could might some day perhaps help in creating one. All while reminding us that the author has worked extensively with these structures and how successful he's been in the business world and how much it owes to him.

This last part is very unconnected with the beginning of the book and really offers no insight, no roadmap, no credible evidence that anything it talks about can or will be used to progress in brain emulation. There are currently several projects working in this, like the Blue Brain project, which Kurzweil mentions but unfortunately doesn't go in any depth into them. It feels more like filler content recycled from Kurzweil's past work and feels tired and lazy, compared with the lucid brain description of the first part, which is novel in Ray's body of work.

In summary, a mediocre book and one that leaves you hopeful that new advances are made in this fascinating subject and can be described in further work.",5
Bob Blum,4.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,The Cortex Spins its Tales with Hidden Markov Models,"Like a news commentator explaining a bad day on Wall Street,
the cortex has an explanation for everything -
it generates our subjective universe. To paraphrase George Box,
all our brain's models of the world are wrong,
but some are useful, generative, and simple (but not too simple).

In How to Create a Mind acclaimed inventor Ray Kurzweil
puts forth a model of how the brain works:
the pattern recognition theory of mind (PRTM).
The brain successively interiorizes the world as a set of patterns.

Kurzweil's framework uses hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMMs)
as its main stock in trade. HHMMs add to the PRTM model the notion
that those patterns are arranged into a hierarchy of nodes,
where each node is an ordered sequence of probabilistically matched lower nodes.

So, the key question for me is this: are HHMMs
really the key to understanding and building a mind?

Ray has been on this track since the sixties,
when he and I were classmates at MIT. In a spectacular
career spanning decades, Ray invented systems for OmniPage OCR,
text to speech (famously for Stevie Wonder), and
automated speech recognition as in Dragon Naturally Speaking.
Nuance bought Ray's precursor company.

All automatic speech recognition nowadays is done using HHMMs,
and the results are astounding. For example, see Microsoft Research
Chief Rick Rashid's YouTube ""Speech Recognition Breakthrough.""
A computer transcription of Rick's talk appears in
real time and is quite accurate.

The amazing success of HHMMs in handling speech and language is
a story that needs to be understood by AI aficionados, and
Kurzweil presents this topic in a beautifully comprehensible exposition.

Kurzweil elaborates a story here that 1) the cortex is
the key to thought; 2) it is hierarchically organized into
300 million pattern recognizers; 3) each pattern recognizer
consists of a 100 neurons in a vertical minicolumn, and
4) those pattern recognizers communicate with one another
via a Manhattan-like grid (similar to an FPGA) -
end of story for the neocortex.

This is a story similar to the one told by entrepreneur Jeff Hawkins in
On Intelligence, and one that Hawkins, his former associate Dileep George
(now at Vicarious), and Kurzweil himself are trying to capitalize on
in cortex-engineering startups. I eagerly follow their results.

So, HHMMs work well and are a required part of a computational
neuroscience curriculum, but ARE THEY THE MASTER KEY that will unlock
the doors not only to a full understanding of the mind
but also to a future of superintelligent AIs? How to Create a Mind
is a good story but IS IT FICTION or nonfiction?

While HHMMs are required reading for automatic speech recognition,
they DO NOT DO all the brain's heavy-lifting. Rather, the brain employs
MANY mechanisms (which robots that aspire to humanity
may need to incorporate or emulate.)

Five stars for HHMM exposition. Subtract one star for giving short shrift
to the following pivotal neuroscience principles: 1) attentional mechanisms,
2) brain-wide dynamical networks, 3) gamma oscillations and inhibitory networks
and also 5) the role of insula and brain stem in emotion, 6) reward based learning
including the essential role of basal ganglia and midbrain,
and 7) hippocampus and memory.

Despite its corticocentric focus, Kurzweil's impressive engineering
successes make this an important story; furthermore, it is engagingly told.

FIVE STAR stories.)

Addendum: 30 Nov 2012 - Today's issue of SCIENCE (and Ray K's newsletter)
features a story about a new 2.5M spiking neuron model (SPAUN) that

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,"Enjoyable, but fails to say anything truly meaningful or concrete.","I like Kurzweil, he's an excellent inventor and engineer, but consciousness is a much more complicated idea than what he proposes in, ""How to Create a Mind."" There are some interesting things to be learned from the book, but most of them just reinforce the complexities neuroscience and how little we know. I would encourage you to read it as a general overview of the history of computation and for its popular views on technology as a means to escape the human condition. These ideas are exciting, but most of them are prototypes of prototypes. I wouldn't hold your breath.

Stephen E. Robbins,3.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,"A ""Mind,"" but Blind","Despite a severe difference in philosophy, I much enjoyed this book [How to Create a Mind]. I appreciated Kurzweil's recountings, sprinkled throughout, of his own intellectual history during his AI and business building endeavors. The exposition of his pattern recognizer hierarchies and hierarchical Markov chain architecture, clearly done, detailed enough to see what is going on, I thought outstanding and the insights provided on the current state of the art, to include the structure of the Jeopardy playing Watson, were also appreciated. To boot, his revelation of a bit of his own spiritual/religious upbringing, his spiritual view on the natural of evolution, and even the valiant effort to come to grips with the problem of consciousness and machines - all were welcome. In all, I gained a deeper respect for, and understanding of, Dr. Kurzweil and the rationale for his position. It is definitely worth the read.

However, sitting in the center of Kurzweil's thought, in the middle of his hierarchical pattern recognizers, squatting in his Markov networks, there is a huge gorilla. Kurzweil tries to stare down this beast. This begins in his sincere attempt (Chapter 9) to deal with the origin of consciousness and his treatment of Chalmers' problem of qualia - how is it that a computer or neural architecture accounts for our experience of the ""yellowness"" of the grapefruit on the kitchen table. Kurzweil diminishes this problem, at least it terms of its clarity, essentially moving simply to ""how is there our `experience' of this world?"" But this he cannot account for, opting eventually for the ever elusive, near-mystical hope that somehow, from the complexity of computations, consciousness (experience) will ""emerge."" In other words, he actually has no idea how we actually see the world or hear it - nor for his future robots. The difficulty is this: Chalmers' formulation has been misleading; the true problem is explaining the origin of the image of the external world - not only the grapefruit with its yellowness, but the kitchen table with its wood-grained surface, its coffee cup, the knife cutting the grapefruit slices, the floor stretching in every direction with its tiles ... Yes, this image is also our ""experience."" The origin of the image is the problem of perception, and in the history of philosophical thought on this subject, starting with the Greeks, this was essentially considered an optical problem. This image, too, is dynamically transforming over time - the knife is cutting, the coffee pot pouring coffee, the wife's lips moving... Now this is why the gorilla is so huge, more massive than any AI-type theorist wants to realize: If you have no theory of the origin of our image of the external world, then you have no theory of experience, and in turn therefore, you can have no theory of the ""storage"" of this experience; your theory of memory is totally ungrounded, and this despite your Kurzweilian confidence (based by the way on a highly selective reading of the memory literature) that only a ""subset"" or a selected set of elements of this ""experience"" is stored (with no in principle method of selection) and this done in your pattern recognizers. Ungrounded too then is any theory of cognition, reliant as it is on retrieval and use of our experience.

Abstract ""computations"" in themselves are simply insufficient to explain consciousness (our experience). Here then is a distinct possibility concerning the nature of the brain that should give Kurzweil pause: What if the brain, along with the computations or statistical analyses (same thing) that Kurzweil is quite sure are taking place, is at the same time, and actually more importantly, sustaining a real, concrete dynamics - as real, for the sake of example, as an AC motor generating an oscillating electric field of force. Yes, knowing its equations, one can ""simulate"" the AC motor via a computer, but the computer is not generating the oscillating field of electric force; it is not even running a light bulb. For this, one needs a device whose construction and function is to achieve a real, concrete dynamics. This in fact was the thesis of Bergson (Matter and Memory, 1896). Bergson had presciently seen the essence of holography in 1896 (making his theory incomprehensible to his contemporaries). He viewed the universal field, in which we all are embedded, as holographic - a vast interference pattern, a field intrinsically non-imageable. Effectively, he saw the brain (with all its underlying quantum dynamics) as creating a modulated reconstructive wave passing through this holographic field, selecting out information in the field related to the action systems of the body, and in this becoming ""specific to"" a subset of the field - now an image of aspects of the field, e.g., the kitchen with its tables, its chairs and grapefruit. In other words, we are explaining how perception is limited, not how it arises. This image of the external world, due to the brain's dynamics (with its underlying chemical velocities) is specified at a scale of time - a fly ""buzzing"" by the grapefruit, his wings oscillating at 200 cps, is seen as a blur in our normal scale of time. Drop a catalyst into this dynamics - the fly becomes a heron-like fly, slowly flapping his wings and equally now specific to a new possible action of the body, e.g., picking the fly out of the air by a wing, for as the selection of a subset of the field is made in relation to the action systems of the body, then, as Bergson stated succinctly, perception is virtual action. If the brain is actually such a device - a modulated reconstructive wave - consider engineering this - yes, engineering, not software - by 2045.

Of course there is more, for in this conception, perception (experience) is not occurring solely within the brain, therefore experience cannot be solely stored there, yet our experience is retrievable by the same reconstructive wave process. Obviously this is a quite different theory of memory retrieval; it is inherently supportive of analogical retrieval - a phenomenon foundational to thought,to include analogy in general. Hofstadter in his vast consideration of the subject of analogy (Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire of Thinking) clearly has no idea (in fact I sense deep doubt) as to how to implement this operation in a computer (or neural net). Yet analogy - the foundational operation of thought as Hofstadter shows - is something Kurzweil severely underestimates (with only the most cursory of mention).

Finally, the use of ""specific to"" is also exactly the language of J. J. Gibson The senses considered as perceptual systems in his theory of perception, where the brain is ""resonating"" to invariants in the external field and ""specific to"" the external environment. Bergson fills in the holographic mechanism by which Gibson's ""specific to"" explains the origin of the image, but a piece that is critical is Gibson's reliance on invariants defined over time, for example, the form of a rotating cube emerging only over the flow fields defined on its turning sides, and in general on the invariance laws defining the ecological events to which the brain is ""resonating"" (or picking up). The invariance structures defining the events of the ecological world drive the modulation of the ""reconstructive wave,"" the operation of memory retrieval, and the operation of analogy. These laws of invariance must be incorporated into any model of the brain's processing. But this entire literature, namely that of Gibson and ecological psychology (see for example Information, Natural Laws, and Self-Assembly of Rhythmic Movement (Resources for Ecological Psychology)), is unfortunately absent in Kurzweil's thought (and computations). In simply stirring the coffee on the kitchen table, there is a radial flow field over the coffee surface, in the back and forth stirring motion an adiabatic invariant (a constant ratio of the energy of oscillation to the frequency of oscillation), and an inertial tensor whose elements define the resistance to angular acceleration as we wield the spoon. This is not the form of ""invariance"" which Kurzweil envisions or of which he speaks, and it would not be trivial in any way (if possible, which is doubtful) to account for in his architectures, for again, real dynamics are ultimately involved.

These are just some (of many) thoughts on missing pieces in Kurzweil's understanding. There is no way for example that his model will handle the Piagetian learning tasks or in general, anything relying on explicit memory. Consider this just some things by which Dr. Kurzweil might want to ""modulate"" his optimism over 2045, or for that matter, over the achievement of his singularity.",6

Ray Kurzweil's range of knowledge is almost overwhelming. His patient and clear explanation of the structures in the brain will help anyone who has little understanding of it and will be an excellent reinforcer for those with previous knowledge. As a parent and retired teacher I wish this information had been available when my younger brother at age 19 had an auto accident (1957) that left him with permanent aphasia and crippled on his right side. I learned about equipotentiality of brain function, but had no clue that the plasticity of the brain was so powerful. A guest on my radio show suffers from serious autism. The new data I gleaned from this book enabled me to help her in ways no one had in her 38 years. It will enable me to ask better questions to some of my guests. I also realized that my ability to give students the opportunities to try many new things, to fail and learn from their mistakes was now based on solid evidence on the brain's ability to be a pattern recognizer and - learning from its mistakes is learning. Instead our organizations look for error-proofing, like teacher-proofing, that demand mindless, coerced conformity, which crushes the brain's natural creativity. Ray, whose book on the Singularity, discussed his belief that computers will eventually be able to duplicate, even outdo human abilities. Or, we will become one with them, which could give us longer life - or immortality. At 81 I won't be around to see this, but I'm happy for my descendants. Between what the Japanese and others are doing with robotics it is very conceivable they will be our servants first, but why not our companions? Many of us are already cyborgs and when computers are the size of our red blood cells maybe we'll finally see that our heart, our ""guts,"" every organ or system of our body can be read by us and keep us informed. If we can combine this with various types of implants, we could be the creators of our evolution. And, we do need help now as every institution of every society is partially to completely dysfunctional. Despite our often productive rule of law we have not learned to deal effectively with our aggression (necessary for individual survival) or our sexuality (necessary for our species survival.) Ray has given us a blueprint so we can begin to accept the fact that what can be created will be created. The sooner we start to see the potentials he discusses, the sooner we be able to meet many of the challenges our species faces.

David W. Nicholas,2.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,Old news in a new package,"Ray Kurzweil writes as an authority on AI (artificial intelligence). As a practitioner in that field myself, I am not impressed by his expertise. He knows one or two subfields of AI well and is a talented inventor, but his vision of the future of AI simply doesn't hold water.

An informed layman who has never read an AI textbook (or history, such as Nils Nilsson's or Pamela McCorduck's) and knows nothing about cognitive neuroscience (see recent books by Michael Gazzaniga and V. S. Ramachandran) may find this book impressive. It is a place where a great deal of mediocre information is contained between two covers. However, I don't think Kurzweil knows enough about human learning (a large and complex field) and human intelligence (ditto) to get a solid handle on what tasks machine learning and machine intelligence must be able to perform and in what order their respective subtasks will probably be mastered.

There are gifted multidisciplinary thinkers in AI and cognitive science who have proved their ability to run rings around Kurzweil, and none of them purports to be a ""futurist."" Ever since Herbert A. Simon predicted (in 1957) that in a decade the strongest chess player in the world would be a machine (it was four decades before IBM's DEEP BLUE beat World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov in tournament play in May, 1997), serious AI researchers have been very cautious in making predictions about the not-so-near future.

There is an established literature on mind design and Kurzweil has contributed very little to it. This book does not summarize that literature or move it forward. I sincerely doubt it will be remembered five years from now. There are too many good people, from Steven Pinker (who explains the mind for those who aren't experts in it) and John Robert Anderson (one of the experts) to Daniel Dennett and Patricia Churchland (the latter two being examples of a brave new philosophy of mind), who have made contributions to how minds can realistically be designed for us to waste our time with the mediocre thoughts of ""futurists"" and others who aren't telling us a believable story about how they will be built.

We already know a great deal more about mind design and implementation than Ray Kurzweil does, a field I was working in more than 30 years ago. To be blunt, Kurzweil isn't plugged into enough of the right sources of information.",101

Ray Kurzweil: How to Create a Mind; the Secret of Human Thought Revealed

Proposition: Anybody who reads, studies and reflects deeply on Ray Kurzweil's ""How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed"" will never think the same again. The person who opens the book and follows his argument closely cannot be the person who lays it down. He or she, even against their will, if honest will be in some intellectual turmoil because Kurzweil overturns many fundamentals of contemporary conventions on thinking. His title tells it all: He is determined to pursue the secrets of human brains and reproduce these through Artificial Intelligence.

Kurzweil's ideas are so revolutionary that a prior look at his credentials is useful . He wrote his first computer program aged fifteen and sold it for half million dollars. He was the inventor of the first music synthesizer capable of reproducing the grand piano and other orchestral instruments, the CCD flat-bed scanner, the first optical character recognition for all fonts, the first print-to-speech synthesizer and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition. A millionaire many times over, he has received the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest honor in technology, from President Clinton in the White House in 2002. The Wall Street Journal called him the ""restless genius,"" Forbes labeled him the ""rightful heir to Thomas Edison"" and PBS included him as one of the sixteen ""revolutionaries who made America"" in the past two centuries.

Truth in advertizing: No review of this length can possibly explore satisfactorily the mega complexities of Kurzweil's thought. Kurzweil explores the human mind, determining how it functions, and then relates this to the enormous advances in computer technology. He sets this out clearly in two comparative chapters, ""The Biological Neocortex,"" and ""The Biological Inspired Digital Neocortex.""""The goal of the project is to understand precisely how the human brain works, and then to use these revealed methods to better understand ourselves, to fix the brain when needed, and--most relevant to the subject of this book--to create even more intelligent machines."" Already in his previous best-selling book, ""The Singularity is Near,"" he predicts with great confidence the not-too-distant point at which artificial intelligence will surpass human capabilities, and many computer scientists agree. Kurzweil wants to reverse-engineer the brain, and to do this he begins with an examination how the brain thinks, before then moving on to artificial intelligence and the world of computers.

Kurzweil offers a number of provocative ""thoughts on thinking"" in introducing his study of the brain. He describes how he has been `thinking about thinking' since the age of twelve and some of the insights this provided. For instance, most people can recite the alphabet, but fail when they try to do it backwards. To Kurzweil this demonstrates our memories are sequential. ""They can be accessed only in the order that they are remembered."" Next Kurzweil asks that we reconstruct our afternoon's walk, the people we saw. Few can in any detail, to which Kurzweil comments ""...there are no images, videos, or sound recordings stored in our brain. Our memories are stored as sequences or patterns."" And it is this ""pattern recognition"" that Kurzweil finds the true function of the brain.

Kurzweil argues that our memories are stored as sequences of patterns."" He calls it his ""pattern theory of mind."" ""Human being have only a weak ability to process logic, but a very deep core capability of recognizing patterns. He illustrates this by quoting chess master Gary Kasparov who attributes his genius to pattern identification. Kasparov apparently thinks like the rest of us one step at a time, has learned 100,000 board positions, that is, patterns. Kurzweil then describes how these patterns (he estimated 300 million are stored in the neo-cortex) are arranged in ""hierarchies"" in the brain

Although neuroscientists are by no means agreed on how the brain works, Kurzweil believes he has enough evidence to focus almost entirely on the neocortex, which he credits with being able to deal with patterns in hierarchical fashion. The human neocortex is the newest part of the brain, the outermost layer, thin, two-dimensional, about 2.5 milimeters thick. It is intricately folded over the top of the rest of the brain, and accounts for 80% of its weight. Kurzweil offers a standard accepted description of its various functions. The human brain has only weak ability to process logic, but a very deep core capability of recognizing patterns. Such is the centrality of the neocortex in Kurzweil's thinking that he calls other regions of the brain--the amygdale, thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum--the ""old brain"" the pre-evolutionary brain, the ""one we had before we were mammals,"" essential for only a few functions. But it was the neo cortex which exponentially accelerated the pace of human learning, from thousands of years to months--""or less"" he adds.

Putting on his A-I hat, Kurzweil reviews his own accomplishments- culminating most recently in a program enabling the blind to read in all fonts--as they relate to his theories on thinking. Most computer engineers agree that a computer capable of emulating the technical function of the brain is not too far off. Kurzweil goes further: ""Ultimately we will create an artificial neocortex that has the full range and flexibility of its human counterpart. There will be electronic circuits billions of times faster than our biological circuits."" ""Thinking"" will migrate to electronic ""clouds,"" with virtually unlimited capabilities. The system will make possible billions, or even trillions of pattern recognizers, the essence of thought--including the emotions of fear, sadness and pleasure. (Kurzweil doesn't indicate whether the machine will have tear ducts.)

Understandably, there has been some criticism of Kurzweil, most of all for his venture into admittedly bizarre transhumanism in predicting he will be able to talk to his long-deceased (40 years) father. It must be emphasized, however, that he doesn't expect to resurrect his father, merely to create electronic circuitry which can be programmed on all his known characteristics--DNA, RNA, personal qualities, quirks, moods, humor (or not). It's a natural spinoff from his conviction that AI will assume all the qualities of a human being, so that conceivably (with a lot of skepticism) Kurzweil might recreate a robot of his father's qualities. Challenging this facet of his thinking, however, does not basically undercut his other perceptions on thought. Kurzweil also takes some humorous criticism for his admittedly singular health regimen--taking 200 pills daily and having monthly blood transfusions. It remains to be seen who gets the last laugh.

The public has already had something of an introduction to what Kurzweil is projecting in the performance of IBM's computer, universally recognized as ""Watson,"" on the television show Jeopardy in soundly trouncing the best human players ever on the show. In February 2011 (eons ago in digital terms) Watson correctly answered correctly virtually every question, including those including puns, similes and metaphors.Two such questions were: (a) Wanted for a twelve-year crime spree of eating King Hothgar's warriors: officer Beowulf has been assigned the case garment worn by a child, perhaps aboard an operatic ship, and (b) In act three of an 1846 Verdi opera, this Scourge of God is stabbed to death by his love, Odabella. (Watson is not infallible, Watson's performance is beyond belief--and right in the AI direction Kurzweil is projecting. It (or is it ""he? she?)) runs on 90 IBM 750 servers with 15 terabytes of RAM and 2,800 processors operating in parallel. It's preloaded with dozens of encyclopedias, news articles, internet connections. It contains all of Wikipedia. This data base is humongous, far beyond the capability of the human brain. Watson scans two million pages in three seconds. Kurzweil bristles at criticism that Watson only works through statistical probabilities rather than ""true"" understanding. So do humans, he retorts. ""One could just as easily dismiss the distributed neurotransmitter concentrations and redundant connection patterns i n the human cortex as `statistical information.'"" By 2020, says Kurzweil, ""we'll have at least in a routine personal computer type computer (power) about equal to the human brain."" ""...at today's rate of change,"" he adds, ""we will achieve an amount of progress equivalent to that of the whole 20th century in 14 years.""

Regardless of how one judges the multiple facets of Kurzweil's theories, he clearly established two indisputable facts shaping our lives. Research, from neuroscience to psychiatry to physical monitoring through such techniques as MRI imaging, is providing new insights into the biological mind at exponential speeds. Parallel to this, understanding of the digital world is progressing even more rapidly, with the ""singularity"" point-- where biological brain and the digital world connect--not . And, yes, what if things take a bad turn and the computers get out of hand and turn on their masters, as with ""Hal"" in ""2000: Space Odyssey"" who goes berserk and turns on his creators. Ray Kurzweil makes an unassailable case that it's time to begin thinking more profoundly about thinking.far away. Indeed, for most persons the distinction between ""I"" and ""my IPhone"" is blurring--the computer virtually a `brain extender' of our selves. Kurzweil describes how when Google shut down he thought ""part of my brain was going on strike."" It makes clear, ""how thoroughly we have already outsourced parts of our thinking to the cloud of computing."" Clearly it's time to begin to think through the ramifications of this, everything from robotics to the cyber world",5

A. D. Thibeault,4.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,A Brief Summary and Review,"*A full executive summary of this book is available here: An Executive Summary of Ray Kurzweil's 'How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed'

When IBM's Deep Blue defeated humanity's greatest chess player Garry Kasparov in 1997 it marked a major turning point in the progress of artificial intelligence (AI). A still more impressive turning point in AI was achieved in 2011 when another creation of IBM named Watson defeated Jeopardy! phenoms Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter at their own game. As time marches on and technology advances we can easily envision still more impressive feats coming out of AI. And yet when it comes to the prospect of a computer ever actually matching human intelligence in all of its complexity and intricacy, we may find ourselves skeptical that this could ever be fully achieved. There seems to be a fundamental difference between the way a human mind works and the way even the most sophisticated machine works--a qualitative difference that could never be breached. Famous inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil begs to differ.

To begin with--despite the richness and complexity of human thought--Kurzweil argues that the underlying principles and neuro-networks that are responsible for higher-order thinking are actually relatively simple, and in fact fully replicable. Indeed, for Kurzweil, our most sophisticated AI machines are already beginning to employ the same principles and are mimicking the same neuro-structures that are present in the human brain.

Beginning with the brain, Kurzweil argues that recent advances in neuroscience indicate that the neocortex (whence our higher-level thinking comes) operates according to a sophisticated (though relatively straightforward) pattern recognition scheme. This pattern recognition scheme is hierarchical in nature, such that lower-level patterns representing discrete bits of input (coming in from the surrounding environment) combine to trigger higher-level patterns that represent more general categories that are more abstract in nature. The hierarchical structure is innate, but the specific categories and meta-categories are filled in by way of learning. Also, the direction of information travel is not only from the bottom up, but also from the top down, such that the activation of higher-order patterns can trigger lower-order ones, and there is feedback between the varying levels. (The theory that sees the brain operating in this way is referred to as the Pattern Recognition Theory of the Mind or PRTM).

As Kurzweil points out, this pattern recognition scheme is actually remarkably similar to the technology that our most sophisticated AI machines are already using. Indeed, not only are these machines designed to process information in a hierarchical way (just as our brain is), but machines such as Watson (and even Siri, the voice recognition software available on the iPhone), are structured in such a way that they are capable of learning from the environment. For example, Watson was able to modify its software based on the information it gathered from reading the entire Wikipedia file. (The technology that these machines are using is known as the hierarchical hidden Markov model or HHMM, and Kurzweil was himself a part of developing this technology in the 1980's and 1990's.)

Given that our AI machines are now running according to the same principles as our brains, and given the exponential rate at which all information-based technologies advance, Kurzweil predicts a time when computers will in fact be capable of matching human thought--right down to having such features as consciousness, identity and free will (Kurzweil's specific prediction here is that this will occur by the year 2029).

What's more, because computer technology does not have some of the limitations inherent in biological systems, Kurzweil predicts a time when computers will even vastly outstrip human capabilities. Of course, since we use our tools as a natural extension of ourselves (figuratively, but sometimes also literally), this will also be a time when our own capabilities will vastly outstrip our capabilities of today. Ultimately, Kurzweil thinks, we will simply use the markedly superior computer technology to replace our outdated neurochemistry (as we now replace a limb with a prosthetic), and thus fully merge with our machines (a state that Kurzweil refers to as the singularity). This is the argument that Kurzweil makes in his new book 'How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed'.

Kurzweil lays out his arguments very clearly, and he does have a knack for explaining some very difficult concepts in a very simple way. My only objection to the book is that there is a fair bit of repetition, and some of the philosophical arguments (on such things as consciousness, identity and free will) drag on longer than need be. All in all there is much of interest to be learned both about artificial intelligence and neuroscience.

Nutty Prof.,1.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,Does not explain how to create a mind.,"This book is written by an upper management type who has not been in the trenches for years. He has very little knowledge of AI and this book is an exploration into unproven theories of intelligence production. He starts out with what he calls ""Pattern Recognizers "" and then continues to quote the use of those without ever providing a solid explanation for what they are and what they do. He just says they work and that he did a lot of research on them.

He talks about the biological functions of the brain but never makes a connection for how that view of the brain produces intelligence (a mind). He gives a complicated view of the brain and shows the storage methods the brain might use, the way words are stored and other unimportant facts that do nothing to make the reader understand how a mind is produced.

He also attempts to explain the functions of the human brain in computer science terms which may be OK for computer science professionals but is probably cumbersome for the layman. I have a computer science background and I found it a very hard read. He never gives even a perfunctory explanation of how the brain produces thought, which I would assume would be included in a book that claims it knows how to create a mind.

Ray Kurzweil has taken me further in my quest to understand how we learn and process language than I ever thought possible. I have to admit, that I was ready to read this book, having read Steven Pinker's books, several by Gary Marcus, Larsen-Freeman and others in the field of language acquisition & thought. Kurzweil gets right down to it, and makes the columnar, multilayered perceptrons, (pattern receptors) seem like a Lego construction. If you want to check out just how much Kurzweil has done the heavy lifting for you, look up ""columnar structure in the neo cortex"" on your browser. Like Richard Dawkins, Kurweil has taken an incredibly complex subject and made it accessible to the educated and persistent reader. I add the 'persistent,' because this book will take some effort, but it is well within the range of most, and the rewards are significant.

DeeMee,5.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,Excellent view of pattern matching in the mind,"Of course another in Kurzweil's books on working our way to AI good enough to have a mind of its own. To be conscious in the way humans are.

About half the book is explaining PRTM (his pattern recognition theory of the mind). Pretty good explanation in layman's terms of how important pattern matching is in functioning of the mammalian brain. Some of this info is covered in more detail in ""On Intelligence"". You also get some taste of it in ""Reading in the brain: the Science and Evolution of a Human Invention"" by Dehaene. One result of this is the mammalian brain is portrayed as a repeated group of pattern matching modules. This book explores that and explains some of the subtle effects that result.

It goes on to some reasonable conjecture about how understanding this has already and will increasingly allow us to artificially in a digital manner accomplish very much the same resulting processing. And then spends the last bit of the book examining whether a machine with human levels of processing ability or beyond will be considered conscious, be accepted by humans as such and what some implications might be. Along with that is the sticky examination of what it means to be conscious even as a human. And finally the author's idea that increasingly we will augment and merge with improved pattern matching abilities to enhance our own rather perhaps than constructing completely stand alone intelligent machines.

All in all a book very much worth reading. Most of his ideas are handled by others elsewhere and are up to date. His isn't a lone far out view of this field. He does mention his own work a bit much for my taste, but then again I suppose he has earned that. I would say, this current book has a tone more down to earth, accessible and less that of a grand utopian vision of the future than his previous books. I think some of it is we are much closer to knowing how the brain works than we were. So less need to guess about what we will find out though no doubt there are still surprises in store for us all.",2
Paul W,5.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,Highly recommended,"How to Create a Mind, by Ray Kurzweil, may convince you that the human brain is less complicated than it seems at first glance. Rather than a maze of randomly connected neurons, think of the brain as a dense but orderly matrix of identical pattern recognizers (PRs), each consisting of about 100 neurons. These PRs are arranged in five to seven layers, each connected to layers above and below it. Each PR sums the strengths of its input signals and, if the sum is stronger than its threshold value, triggers its output signal. In other words, each PR measures its inputs and decides whether to send an output signal to the next higher layer (and sometimes to other PRs and lower layers). Each layer combines signals from other layers in order to make higher-level decisions.

Kurzweil summarizes the physical evidence for this type of hierarchical organization in the brain and describes how he has used this model to develop computer programs that can accurately scan printed text (OCR), synthesize speech, and interpret human speech. For these tasks, programs based on hierarchical pattern recognition have been shown to work better than other approaches.

The author presents a good discussion of artificial intelligence research and biological experiments that demonstrate that our brains actually work this way. He discusses how human thoughts, decisions and emotions can arise from millions of simultaneously operating pattern recognizers in our brains. He also discusses interesting questions about mental diseases, free will, artistic abilities, and possible limits of artificial intelligence.

If computer speed and memory capacity continue to increase exponentially, as they have in the past, Kurzweil concludes that it will be possible (by the year 2029) for a computer to equal the thinking capabilities of a human mind.",2
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,1.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,Fails to deliver,"The areas of cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence have grown by leaps and bounds in the last two decades, and both of these areas have found real-world application. These applications are the consequence of the concentrated efforts of hundreds of researchers, technicians, and venture capitalists, who typically had to spend a lot of time in the trenches doing the grudge work that is the rule rather than the exception for difficult areas such as these. There were false leads and conceptual barriers that had to be overcome, and success was and is measured by working applications, and not by the ability to counter arguments against those who claimed that advances in machine intelligence were either impossible or very limited. There is much remaining to be done, but whatever goals are set and attained should not be dictated by marketing hype or philosophical objections to the idea of artificial intelligence.

The author of this book has been one of the early innovators in domain-specific artificial intelligence, meaning that the applications and devices he helped to created are limited to very narrow domains of expertise and knowledge. In that respect he is not so much different than most of the talented individuals who have contributed to the field of machine intelligence. The major difference between the author and others lies in his vision of the future of this field. Progress in this field will be hyper-exponential he has argued in prior books, and this progress will include the creation of an artificial brain that can not only perform the functions of the human brain, but do them much, much faster. This book gives an overview of how to build such a brain, with pattern recognition being the predominant tool by which this brain will deal with knowledge and build its expertise. Such a tool is the primary method by which humans deal with the world, the author argues, and he gives some evidence drawn from the field of neuroscience to support his claim.

Although the author's discussions are interesting and thought provoking, as a whole the book does not deliver, and one of the main reasons for this is the lack of a quantitative measure of intelligence that will gauge progress in the development of an artificial brain. The word ""intelligence"" appears in at least sixty-five places in this book in the context of both human and machine intelligence, but absolutely no quantitative measure of it is described or articulated upon. If progress in machine intelligence is ""hyper-exponential"" as the author claims, than he needs to inform the reader to what extent a machine is for example 2 times, or 4.6 times more intelligent than another machine. Such a measure would not only support his case on the rate of advance in machine intelligence but would also be extremely valuable to AI researchers as a whole. The field of AI is begging for a workable/practical definition and measure of intelligence.

Readers will have to accept the qualitative assessments the author makes in the book regarding the advances in AI. He seems to be very impressed with the IBM Watson machine and its ability to understand both spoken and written language in any domain of knowledge, but the author does not give any examples where Watson has taken the initiative to seek out or create new knowledge on its own. The reviewer is not aware of a Watson-like machine that can devise new theories independent of domain or area of knowledge. Humans of course are able to do this with gusto, and more than ever it is this ability, and not token assimilation of existing knowledge, that characterizes human intelligence.

There are also many other problems with this book, even anecdotal ones like the authors mistaken notion of the motion of the Crookes radiometer, and the lengthy diatribes on consciousness and free-will. The book ends with even more refutation of arguments raised by philosophers and academics against the notion of machine intelligence. The author is successful in the refutations of these arguments, but the building of an artificial brain depends on constructive work, not the winning of philosophical debates. If the author could refrain from indulging in these debates and get on with the difficult task of creating intelligent machines, the AI research community, and the popular audience he is addressing would be much better served. As it stands, the book offers no constructive guidance to creating an intelligent machine, and its contents would be very different if it did.",34
Donald J Schmit,1.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,Not science,"Kurzweil is not a trained neuroscientist. This book in not written in a manner consistent with the scientific method. I hope that is enough information to dissuade people from fawning over this book. I recommend Pinker's ""How the Mind Works"".

Let me explain the logic of the first three chapters:
Darwin and Einstein both reshaped the world and their respectively scientific communities by using mental models.
The author will now pose several psychological though experiments with nebulous answers.
The author suggests that the answers from these experiments provide a breakthrough interpretation of brain science.

Rule 1 in the scientist handbook is ""Do not compare yourself with Einstein"". Its not even clear if there is real science here. Cortical columns have largely been debunked as anatomically singular structures.",4
Homunculus,5.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,Thought experiments of conciousness,"I have read two other books by Kurzweil and find him to be a compelling author. He captures my imagination with his future view. He takes a very optimistic position on the future of things. In some ways seemingly ignorant. But we will never know until it has passed. The chapter on whether we are conscious and what consciousness is, in my view, is the highlight of the book. It was a real mind bender which has created many hours of discussion with family and friends.

I'm very happy that I read this book and some of the other reviewers pointed out accurately that he spends quite a bit of readers time advertising his current projects and companies. You can either be annoyed about it or simply take it for what it was most likely meant to be as a way of qualifying himself to the first time reader of his work.

Jeremy May,5.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,A visionary book,"I found many of the ideas presented in this book to be quite interesting. As this was my first book from Kurzweil, many of his prior predictions and ideas, such as LOAR, were new to me.

He lays out the explanation of HHMMs fairly well, but I feel like it came really late in the book. Most of the book is a framework set up to convince the reader that brain fits well with the use of HHMMs.

My only complaint about the book is that as someone that knows a bit about cognitive psychology and neuroscience concepts, I found much of this book repetitive to what I knew. I don't hold it against the author though since this is a book probably meant for people that probably know far less.

Kurzweil is a visionary that has a history for doing great things so I don't think his ideas are necessarily without merit.",1
Bookworm9765,5.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,The Path to True Artificial Intelligence,"In ""How To Create a Mind,"" Ray Kurzweil offers a fascinating and readable overview of his theory of how the human brain works, as well as a road map for the future of artificial intelligence.

Kurzweil makes a compelling argument that choosing the proper scale is critical when approaching the problem of how the brain works. Many skeptics believe that we are no where near understanding or simulating the human brain because of its overwhelming complexity. However, Kurzweil suggests that a complete understanding of the micro-level details (such as individual neurons or even biochemistry) is really not necessary. Instead, the brain can be understood and simulated at a higher level. The book gives many examples in other fields of science and engineering where such a high level approach has produced tremendous progress.

The core of Kurzweil's theory is that the brain is made up of pattern processing units comprised of around 100 neurons, and he suggests that the brain can be understood and simulated primarily by looking at how these lego-like building blocks are interconnected.

The book includes accounts of some of the most important research current research in both brain science and AI, especially the ""Blue Brain Project"" (that is working on a whole brain simulation), and also the work on IBM's Watson (Jeopardy! champion) computer.

Kurzweil continues to assert that we will have human-level AI by around 2029. A typical human brain contains about 300 million pattern processing units, but Kurzeil thinks that AIs of the future might have billions, meaning that machine intelligence would far exceed the capabilities of the human mind.

Ray Kurzweil is clearly an optimist both in terms of the progress he foresees and its potential impact on humanity. If he is even partly right in his predictions then the implications could be staggering. Machines that are as smart, or even smarter, than people could completely transform society, the economy and the job market.",110

Omar Z Ahmad,5.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,A Revolution for a New Paradigm,"First, I would like to preface this by saying that I am just a computer science student, not a scientist or authority in the least about the subject matter.
That being said, I would like to say that it is very likely that people may have missed the main point of this book, which I may be lucky to see from a different perspective because of my exposure to several relevant volumes over my last few semesters.
I would first like to point anyone interested not to volumes about brain theory and the like, but rather to The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, by Thomas Kuhn. If you are already familiar with it, good, because I would like to place this book in the context of Kuhn:
Basically, what we have had, according to Jeff Hawkins On Intelligence, is a first real attempt to define a theory of the brain. In the past, according to Kuhn, the introduction of theories are the cause of ""scientific revolutions,"" basically a scientific community coming to terms with a new theory, either by rejection or acceptance of said theory. Although Hawkins presents his theory in his book, by his own admission, it was not supposed to be a complete theory, but rather one to be developed upon. The ""revolution"" begins by an individual presenting a theory: subsequent theories are either opposing, contradictory, or supporting this theory. Hawkins was attempting to begin this process with his book, which, according to Kurzweil, came to fruition in the hands of Dileep George (who is quoted praising this book in the description, by the way).

So, it is important to note that much of what Kurzweil wrote was not anything revolutionary per se; that was what he wrote The Singularity Is Near for. It also was not to present a new theory; that's what On Intelligence did. What Kurzweil is doing here is supporting the work of Hawkins and George by presenting the PRTM, as he calls it, in a more developed form, in the context of natural language learning (a subject he is well aware of, as he plugs several times in the book), and in the context of his Law of Accelerating Returns, as presented in his last book.
Perhaps he isn't completely right, and perhaps there are things that could be disputed, but that's the point; scientific discussion and dispute is supposed to follow this release.
Another thing to note is that he didn't just write a book because he wanted his name on a book this year (though any author could be guilty of that); he has the extensive resources and prior experience to follow through with the work that is necessary to test his theory, another thing that he mentioned in the book.

I hope that this helps those that were disappointed with this book to at least see it in a new light. In that vein, it may well be that this book could be a new ""classic"" of scientific literature in the vein of Darwin's On the Origin of Species, or Newton's The Principia. Then again, it might not, but I would hang onto your digital/pulp version of the book for, I don't know, maybe 30-some years?",5
B Luxenberg,5.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,A must read,"While I thought that Jeff Hawkins ""On Intelligence"" was interesting, it was only marginally readable. On the other hand, Kurzweil's latest book, in addition to being filled with compelling arguments and facts, is eminently readable. Not only is Kurzweil a world class futurist and technologist, he is a very adequate writer. For anyone who is interested the future of AI, this is a must read. Skeptics -- who think human intelligence is a unique facility which can never be mimicked, let alone exceeded, by machines -- will find 'How to Create a Mind' worthwhile.",2

Matthew C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,"Grand title, little actually delivered","Repetitive, pompous, the content is vague enough to make you wonder if he wrote this in between him filing patents. Doesn't even come close to fulfilling the titles promise.",1
BruceK,2.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,"I might have called this ""Pulp Non-Fiction"" ...","The books has some interesting moments ... but in the parlance of my Jr. College class designations, this is like ""Intro to How To Create A Mind - 10"" not a real class that teaches you something. I would put the level of this somewhere around high-school or early college level and for those who do not really know anything about the subject.

At every step of the way Kurzweil goes off on historic or trivial anecdotes, wasting our time because he really has damn little to say but to re-phrase what others have said. If you read the quotes at the beginning of the chapters and you have read some neuroscience before, you might even have been able to write this book.

I appreciate Kurzweil's accomplishments, he is an accomplished individual ... but in writing a book that is merely an ad for his own celebrity, or pat on the back for his own job well done, I expected more. This is not ""How To Create A Mind"" ... the title is false advertising.

Kurzweil is very much like the Turing Test he likes to dwell on so much ... that is, if he can talk vaguely and skillfully around the subject the reader will never know he is not telling us really anything new, any more than a talking robot is proving it is human by fooling us in a teletype test.

It's very interesting to hear scratchpad calculations about what the level of computation is in the human brain, and the increasing level operations per second in the computer industry, and memory bandwidth, etc ... but the whole idea of software, the whole idea of debugging or creating a massively parallel biological system in a computer is covered by continual handwaving.

My thoughts on this are that it is very helpful to know the basic numbers Kurzweil spends time setting up for this arguments ... but from there it peters out to nothing. Kurzweil spends quite a while attacking Roger Penrose for what Kurzweil characterizes as comparing quantum computation and consciousness as both being mysterious and so must be connected somehow ... well, hello, to me it sounds like Kurzweil does the same thing when he says that when the two levels of computations and basic understanding of computers and the human brain get close that we will somehow be able to program something like a brain, or have it program itself.

I don't buy it. It's interesting, and I don't complain that he is trying, what I am complaining about in this book is the lack of real value to any thinking person who read anything about this subject, and particularly if they are familiar with Kurzweil's writing itself.

I cannot give this book a 1, that would be unfair as it would be very good for a novice in the subject, nor can I give it a 3 or higher, because that would mean that it achieved what the title said ... in either a excellent way or mediocre way. So I give it a 2 because it is a rehash of stuff that I think it close to an insult to Kurzweil's fans and followers and to those who pay good money to hear new ideas, not the same rehashed stories and points made in many many other books.

""On Intelligence"" has been mentioned in some of these reviews. That is not quite a good book to compare this two, because it is over 10 years old now I think, and also most of the important points I recall from ""On Intelligence"" are covered more simply and better in ""How To Create A Mind"". The description of the nervous system and the brain and some of the parts of the brain are well done.

Even had the book contained more meat, and less filler, still I would have issues with Kurzweil because in his zeal he seems to completely bypass the ""qualia"" points because he has no way to deal with them - so they are nothing. He gets into a little of these thought experiments and ideas, but then dismisses them. All naturally evolved brains developed to solve the problem of survival .. that is writ large into our whole species back forever. How does that fit into the software of our brains? What about the search for pleasure or happiness, or what about the same foibles that our brains are heir to ... that is, prejudice, pride, making mistakes, correcting and reporgramming ourselves. We are not good at even using our intelligence and our social organization is a disgrace. It is hard to even imagine that we are intelligent or that the intelligent parts of us has anything to do with other than the ablity to pass ideas, experiences and doubts back and forth to each other on things that are not really important to us, because we act secretively and selfishly on anything that is, and we whip up fictions about what is important and fight for them from the time we are infants.

I have the feeling that life has been put through its tests ... that all the little lessons of being whatever it is that a given species, brain, DNA is, is moving along in time from a given beginning diverging constantly, in a brilliant design of nature ... and that when we try to understand nature we get little chunks of it, and our history has been to use those chunks to make money or weapons or gain the approval of those we need to gain the approval of ... but how would a machine do this? There are probably critical ideas and ""software"" that are not perceivable just as humans do not understand the weather patterns of the world, or all the ramification of DNA and genetic engineering. There is a lot more to software than just a basic program, there is what is judgement.

I think it will be much easier to create tools for humans to use than it will be to create a mind, and those tools may not be so great as there is so much ambiguity inside our brain than we can express or experience in words.

As I read this book there were a few times when I flashed on the old Star Trek episode ""What Are Little Girls Made Of"" where a man is transformed into a machine, and in the end of the show has lost what makes him essentially human. That episode aired something like 47 years ago ... these concepts are not hard and do not bear filling a whole book full of them when the title promises the reader something about ""How to Create a Mind"" and ""The Secret of Human Thought Revealed"" ... I have to say it's disappointing.",12

The most important thing about this book is that it illustrates to people the core concept that recursive - ""hierarchical"" as he calls it - pattern identification can lead to amazing emergent effects.

2. Chapters 1-5 summarize hierarchal hidden markov models. He presents very little experimental evidence to suggest that this type of algorithm is employed by the brain besides his back of the envelope calculations.

3. Chapters 6-10 offer a hazy and amateur philosophical whirlwind summary of some topics like consciousness, identity, and free will.

KimoKailua,3.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,Not as good as previous work..,"I'm a big Kurzweil fan and I particularly liked ""The Singularity is Near"", so I was looking forward to this with great anticipation. Therefore I was surprised to find many chapters to be nearly unreadable. The language becomes ponderous and technical and when the author had to make a word choice he invariably chose the most obtuse or technical. The obtuse language and description takes away from the power of his arguments which are quite convincing. I recognize that some of the areas require technical language but that doesn't excuse the lack of editorial choice. If he wants a wider audience for his work, he should consider finding a good science writer to assist with this. He's obviously so bright that he may not be aware of the flaw that his general readers would prefer more accessible work that isn't quite so painful to read.

Pros:
*clearly and convincingly makes the case for human level machine intelligence within a reasonable timeline
*clearly and convincingly dismantles the contrary arguments of his many critics

Cons:
*overly technical chapters in some areas
*unnecessary obtuse language and opaque sentence structure make some chapters nearly unreadable

Can't recommend this for a general audience. You really have to want to read the book to wade through. If you have a predilection towards technical or academic literature, this will undoubtedly be fine.",28
Richard Foster,1.0 out of 5 stars,How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,Save your money,"Save your money.

This book is garbage. Kurzweil is the embodiment of scientific hubris in his latest communal pat on the back for social scientists everywhere. For the record, when I say social scientists I'm not referring to psychologists or anthropologists; I define social scientists as people who read books about science or books in the ""science"" section of bookstores and sincerely believe it's a worthwhile substitute to college or university education. You know the ones. They're the types that walk up to a PhD in Physics in some social gathering and say things like ""I read a book on Schroedinger's Cat, and I think I understand. I don't get any of the math or theory, but I understand what he was saying.""

From his fundamental misunderstanding of the philosophy of mathematical constants to his contention that if life existed elsewhere we would have found it by now (paraphrase), this book is an example of the sort of Ivory Tower snobbery and arrogance that (sadly) exists within scientific or pseudo-scientific social circles. It's 340 some odd pages of the epitome of pride, not unlike those in the intelligent design circles, who boldly contend: ""We have solved all mysteries in science! If we haven't, we're working on it, and it won't be long now! If we can't, it's not a mystery or science anyway!""",8

It is very well written. It ussually explains the proof ideas before starting, and gives detailed proofs. If you can afford it, this book makes a great intro to complexity theory.

EJS,2.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,Not detailed enough,"Given the fact that this is considered one of the ""standard"" reference books, I was surprisingly unimpressed with this book.

There are a number of complaints I have about this book:
1. Its price is just obscene - the fact that they would charge that much for a book that a lot of people are forced to purchase is just wrong on the face of it.
2. The lousy price is especially irritating given what you get for it. Fact is, even at a much lower price this textbook would be a bad value. At a mere 480 pages, this is not an especially long textbook; not sure how the publisher can possibly justify charging an above-average price for a shorter-than-average textbook. There's really nothing I can think of that would justify this book's price tag; it's not like they add some fabulous feature (software package, etc.) that makes this book worth the extra money. I suppose it's more of a ""they charge it because they can"" type scenario.
3. Not only is it overpriced, it's not even particularly well written. Quite bluntly, the book's relatively short because it doesn't explain anything.

With regards to the third point, I completely agree with the other reviewer who commented that this book is written as if you already understood the material; this is exactly what he does. I had to consult other textbooks all the time in order to be able to solve the book's problems because I found the author's explanations inadequate. It's almost like the author had a minimum word count and he was struggling to meet it (""OK, just 10 more pages to go before I can release it"").

On the plus side, the problem sets are, for the most part, decently selected if you have decent reference material to help you with them (e.g. a different textbook, a good professor); if your professor's not that great and all you have is this book I pity you, the book is of some limited help in solving the problems I guess but you'll need a LOT more, especially if you're not already really familiar with this material.

I guess this book could be pretty helpful for review or reference if you already know the material, but overall it's not so great for learning the subject for the first time, especially if you're stuck using it as your primary learning source.",20
L. Blunden,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,Appeals to novice and expert,"I have a long experience with software development, but not much background in computation theory, just fascinating tidbits I have picked up here and there. So, this book for the first time deepens and organizes for me this hightly abstract and difficult topic.

Being a novice, I at first was afraid that the text of the book would be beyond my understanding. It was not. For sure, the proofs are difficult and may appeal to the person with a degree in computer science. But the copious diagrams, figures and tables are wonderful supplements to the understandable text. For the first time I really could grasp the subtleties of the finit automata, non-determinism, regular expressions, pushdown automata and other topics.

Certainly I can recommend this book to the beginner at computation theory, and even to the more advanced student who may want to review the topic.",18

Will,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,Amazing Book,"One of the best books ever written on the theory of computation. I started seeking different theory of computation books when taking a theory of computation class last semester since I found the other text that we were using so confusing that I felt compelled to seek further explanation elsewhere. I found the previous edition of this book in my school's library and was stunned at how thoroughly this book explained the topics which were confusing me in the required class text. After the semester was over I knew I needed to have this book for my collection. I sold back the text I bought for class and bought this new edition. I am absolutely thrilled with the purchase.

The material in this book is extremely dense, but all of the topics covered are extremely well covered. I highly suggest purchasing this book if you are interested in the material or are taking a theory of computation class, even if the suggested text is a different book.",4

Lee M. Jacobs,2.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,In exact and hand wavy.,"Using this book for an intro to computation course. I can't stand the text. The first chapters on DFA's and NFA's through to PDA's are easy enough to understand; it's when you reach Turing machines that the book takes a dive. This text will provide ""proofs"" of examples. These are never strict proofs, they provide ""intuition"" but hardly an understanding. While this isn't an analysis text, the books proof for the uncountability of the real numbers is atrocious. The one example that is easier to prove and demonstrates diagnolization better would be proving that the set of binary numbers is uncountable. The text does this after the fact and only devotes a few sentences to it. Later it introduces the concept of reducibility, I am not familiar with how strict Turing and Church were when proving a language is decidable or not, but I am almost certain they put forward something more substantial than the ""programs"" that Sipser uses as proofs. If you're looking for intuition, then this book is fine. If you're looking to understand this material thoroughly I suggest something else.",8
Andrew Oliver,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,First Thoughts: Very Mathematical; A Deep Treatment Of This Subject; Up To Date Too,"This is a book I would recommend to third year university computer science and third year university pure mathematics students. Rather terse in style densely packed with challenging content, I really will have to take time to read it carefully to fully appreciate it.

In my Bachelor of Science at the University of Melbourne years ago I studied some related content in a subject entitled 618-341 Mathematical Logic, and did not take the computer science subject 622-301 Theory Of Computation. Now, from the mathematician's point of view finitism is irrelevant it's a matter of axiom systems being consistent and proving things. The Godel number encoding of theorems and interiority arguments and clever free variable substitution arguments together with model theory were used to establish as true many powerful results ...

I note that the terminology has changed since 1982; what was called then 'a recursive formula' is now called Turing decidable and what was called then 'a recursively enumerable formula' is now called 'Turing recognizable'. For example, this author would regard a Turing machine that took a blank tape and churned out the binary representation of pi 3.14159265358979323846 etc in some tape representation to an infinite number of places as a Turing machine that loops, even if such a Turing machine was reasonably well behaved in terms of its generally moving forwards ... This begs the question of real number representation; the bit string 0.11111111111 ... is essentially the same real value as 1.0000000000 ... This suggests to me that Turing theory has taken a more finitistic turn; whether this is to avoid paradoxes recently found I haven't worked out yet. In the real world with its quantum mechanics randomness and lack of apparent finititude it's quite concievable that a multi-tape Turing machine (as described in outline in section 3.2 p176ff) device could resolve a real number function evaluation so as to avoid a value ending in an infinite series of 1's that rightly should be rounded up, and store the real value as a constant in some 'set' device for storing real numbers ... However till we know more about the real truths underlying physics this is mere speculation ...

There are a lot of topics that are quite new to me. For example, P less than NP less than PSPACE less than NPSPACE less then EXPTIME seems a rather more complex hypothesis regarding algorithms and their expected time to complete than I've met in other works ... Reading this section I hope will prove rewarding ...

Overall it seems that the field has moved on since 1982 in many a way and I hope this book enables me to refresh my knowledge with the latest results. An excellent treatment of the whole field of theory of computation.

The only criticism I can think to make is that this work seems to have a finitistic philosophy rather than a mathematical Platonist philosophy ... but then this is essential to the computer science approach rather than a pure mathematical one ...",6
MelRad,1.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,Not the best book,"This book is very hard to read because of the way it is formatted, and it spends a lot of time on proofs, and doesn't provide to many examples.

Max L. Day,3.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,so so,"Sipser is probably a genius, so I have to give him credit where credit is due. He knows his material inside and out.

My criticism of his book is more of the way it's being taught in colleges rather than the quality of the book. The book itself is packed to the brim with more material than you could probably use in two semesters of classes. My class covered only part of the book in one semester.

I think only the basics of this class should be taught on the undergraduate level: state machines, context-free languages, turing machines, and a few other things. The high-level proofs and harder material should be reserved for a graduate-level class, not for undergraduates. IMO, most CS graduates will never see hide nor hair of most of the material in this book in their entire careers, so why punish them with it?",3

ZZ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series),"A useful, comprehensive reference book; awkward to read","This popular book makes a noble attempt at unifying the many different types of probabilistic models used in artificial intelligence. It seems like a good reference manual for people who are already familiar with the fundamental concepts of commonly used probabilistic graphical models. However, it contains a lot of rambling and jumping between concepts that will quickly confuse a reader who is not already familiar with the subject. While the book appears to be systematic in introducing the subject with mathematical rigor (definitions and theorems), it actually skips a lot of fundamental concepts and leaves a lot of important proofs as exercises. I would recommend that a beginner in the subject start with another book like that by Jordan and Bishop, while keeping this book around as a reference manual or bank of practice problems for further study. The Coursera class on this subject is much easier to follow than this book is.",13

I have read a number of books and papers on this topic (including Barber's and Bishop's) and I much prefer this one. Dr. Koller's style of writing is to start with simple theory and examples and walk the reader up to the full theory, while adding reminders of relevant topics covered elsewhere. She accomplishes this without condescending to or belittling the reader, or being overly verbose; each of the 1200 pages is concise and well edited. There is an OpenClassroom course that accompanies the book (CS 228), which I highly recommend viewing, as it contains that same style of teaching but in a different format and often with a somewhat different approach.",2

Aside, I managed to find an error not listed on the errata web page for the book. The equation for MAP queries on page 26 has it as the maximal assignment of a JOINT distribution, while on the next page it is the maximal assignment of a CONDITIONAL distribution (I believe this is the correct one). This was a little confusing until I read page 26 a bit closer.

- The table of contents are not fine-grained enough when viewed from the side bar in kindle - so it is very hard to go to a section referenced in another section
- The book is full of examples, figures equations which are referenced from far flung sections and there is no easy way to navigate to them

For such an expensive book, I would expect Amazon or the publisher to make good use of digital technology to make the reading experience easy. To follow a complex subject like this, being able to navigate between sections by clicking on a reference to an equation or an example is critical.

This book may well be a good reference for someone who already has a deep background in machine learning & artificial intelligence, but it emphatically is not of any use to the novice in the field(1). It contains many proofs of theorems, numerous long-winded ""explanations"" (most of which I don't understand), some algorithms set out in an obfuscated format(2) that I thought had died out about the time I got my BS, but (as far as I've been able to discover) not one line of actual code, nor any implementation, even of the simple ""Hello, World"" sort.

Even if you are afraid of the mathematics involved, the appendix in the book covers what you need to know in order to make sense of the math (most of it is simple algebra) with just a bit of derivatives that involve the chain rule. This is one of the few books that not only goes over the theory but also the step by step implementation (training your network to recognize handwritten numbers in Python) as well as testing the code and making minor tweaks to show how that will affect the overall accuracy of the network. For an added bonus, the author includes a chapter describing how you can train the network to recognize your own handwriting and things you can do to further increase the accuracy.

Even though I highly recommend this book, there are a few grammatical errors as well as labels being incorrect in a few of the diagrams. You can still get through the book without the errors taking away from the content. I'm sure in future revisions, most of these errors will be corrected.

I purchased ""Python Machine Learning"" which starts describing similar topics at the beginning but then the book just moved too fast for me. I didn't know the why and how.

But Tariq's book was amazing, the author really takes his time to explain things mixing text with illustrations to make a point. Usually my attention span with these kind of books is few pages here and there a day, but with this book I couldn't stop. I was on a rhythm , and I felt I could retain the knowledge. When I attempted to read the other books, they all start perfectly on the first chapter, then all of sudden you see code and the authors move too quickly assuming the reader is following along or has some background knowledge. With this book I felt I could indulge in a meaningful dialogue with anyone on the topic, and I could explain things better. After reading few chapters from Tariq’s book, I picked up ""Python Machine Learning"" and what was amazing is that I was able to follow along and all the gibberish stuff started to make sense. So, I would urge anyone to start reading this book first because it covers all the fundamentals including basic Linear Algebra (Matrices).

Canada,5.0 out of 5 stars,Make Your Own Neural Network,I can't remember the last time I was this impressed with a teaching book.,"I bought this book for 3.99 (kindle copy), it's worth much much more. The level of skill the author has in clearly explaining very complex areas is astonishing. It's the EXACT opposite experience most college kids face: an inscrutable teacher speaking in his own language, not really caring if the kids understand or not.

Tariq gets it. He understands how people learn. For example, he first discusses a math equation used in code, then color codes the computer code so the reader can easily understand what is going on in the code.

If you have even an inkling of interest in neural networks: this is your book. By the end of it, you will have built a real neural network that can take image data of a handwritten number and output a classification of the number. Real neural network stuff. When you're done building it, and get the result..you look back and all you did and you're impressed with yourself and impressed with the author, that he so deftly pulled you through all of it. Anyways, buy this book.

Good job, Author.",1
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Make Your Own Neural Network,By far the best intro to NN out there...,"1. Anyone who is crying about kindle...sorry. Kindle version working fine on my phone, laptop and pc.

2. Author does an incredible job at explaining what is being done, how, and why.

3. Anyone crying about it not being deep enough or not math heavy enough...go read. It says gentle introduction to NN. Im so sick of these kids who take a course in calculus and think they are now mathemticians. Real skill is needed to explain a math heavy topic without getting math heavy.

4. This book, in a weekend, does a better job at explaining and showing the beginning of NN than udacity, course rate, or edx.

5. I wish this author would put out more books.",1

Robert J Tilson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Make Your Own Neural Network,The title describes the book acurately,"If you have ever been curious about machine learning, artificial intelligence or expert systems here is a good introduction to artificial neural networks which are a fundamental part of these technologies. The first half of the book describes the theory and in the second half you will learn to code the neural network using the programming language python and jupyter notebooks. I hadn't programmed in over 30 years so it was interesting to see how things had changed since fortran! The book assumes you have no advanced math but it helps to know some elementary linear algebra and differential calculus to understand the theory of neural networks.",1
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Make Your Own Neural Network,Outstanding job fully demystifying the black box called neural nets,"I've never written a review for a book--or any purchased item for that matter. Tariq's ""Make Your Own Neural Network"" has been a joy to read. Over the last year or so it's been a personal quest to finally ""get"" neural networks. I had stumbled across a number of good explanations by Welch Labs (on YouTube) and some random blogs on the basics. However, Tariq does a smashing job of bringing everything together in an extremely accessible and gripping fast read. The image detection example, the step by step code and a motivational approach helped me gain confidence to finally say ""I get it"". Thanks Tariq!",1

Philip H.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R - Second Edition,There are some useful gems in this book,"I'm torn. There are some useful gems in this book, and for the most part, the presentation is simple, albeit a bit pedantic and cartoonish at times. If I was trying to get up to snuff on a new machine learning method, I might start here, since it *does* provide starter code for a variety of problems. That's quite handy. It doesn't, however, go into much depth at all on any one topic. You can't read this book and expect to know how to do any one of these methods well. Certainly, it's a tall order to ask any one book to cover all ML topics in depth, but any potential reader should be aware that this just skims the surface of a whole bunch of topics.

On top of this, who in the world edited this book? Every other page has horrible typos, missing words, repeated sentences. These are not trivial errors either. This is a book about data analysis and yet the reported data are clearly wrong in places, e.g., a result is listed as .06 percent in one spot and then .0006 in another (p. 271). Basic subject-verb agreement errors riddle the text, e.g. ""These output is shown as follows"". Sometimes these are trivial errors, but other times you have absolutely no idea what the intended meaning is. I have about 100 pages more to read but I'm starting to wonder if I'm just wasting my time.",28
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R - Second Edition,"Less tech speak, more meaty","First off, I am newbie to both machine learning and R and wanted find a starting point somewhere. I browsed around many books before deciding on this one. The writing style of Mr. Lantz is provided in a very understandable/readable manner. It's akin to someone sitting next to you and explaining things in a down to earth, layman's fashion rather than try to ""tech speak"" you to death with complicated explanations (aka formal textbook). Just the right amount of hand holding for me. I highlight quite bit and it's actually difficult with this book as there isn't much fluff. He's very succinct. The books states that it's for someone who know some ML and no R or R and no ML. I don't know either and the material is digestible except for one thing: review your stats! I took statistics long ago in college and never really learned it well the first time so I had stop and reread core concepts before continuing. Do yourself a favor and review basic statistics and probability before you start this book. I read both ""Naked Statistics"" and ""Statistics in Plain English"" and it helped me a great deal (and probably will continue to do so since it appears a bulk of machine learning is stats and prob). Currently into about a third of the way in and I am finding it to be very enjoyable and practical. Other reviewers point out that this book is too basic and this may be the case, but for someone like me who is starting from absolute scratch and who needs to understand basic ML concepts (AND basic R) I find it a great book. Will post an addendum once I complete it.",40
Dim Dandy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R - Second Edition,Best ML learning resource I've found,"This book is fantastic. I've been through the first four chapters, so I can't give a complete review yet, but if the rest of the book conains surprises, I will update.

Chapter 3 is on k-nearest neighbor and chapter 4 is on naive Bayes. Both provide a clear explanation of the technique, and its pros and cons, along with a simple, non-programming example. Then there is an excellent walkthrough of applying the technique to real world data, and some hints at how to improve the results by adjusting the inputs. After each chapter, I felt that I was ready to apply the technique, with the understanding that I did not yet understand everything about the topic. The chapters also are careful to explain that 1) the particular R package used has more options than have been covered and 2) there are other R packages to be investigated and experimented with.

I just couldn't be happier with these chapters, and I am fired up to keep reading and working along with the examples. It has been years since I have been reading a tech book and thinking, ""OK, just a little bit more, I don't want to quit yet"" instead of, ""Have I spent enough time and effort on this for one day yet?"" It's that good.

Although the book does provide a bit of an introduction to R, it is by no means comprehensive, and I have found that R takes time, patience and frustration to master (not that I've mastered it yet). So if I had been a complete R newbie, I probably would have struggled more.

I also found that a recent course I took in statistical inference was helpful, although not really required. At one point the book describes normalizing features using Z scores. I knew what Z scores were, so that was a point I didn't need to simply take on faith.

If you are relatively new to R and machine learning, and you want to learn to do machine learning with R, this *is* the book.

UPDATE: I am working through chapter 10, on validating model performance, and it is a goldmine. Maybe it's a matter of my general knowledge about machine learning concepts coalescing at the same time I'm reading this chapter, but it was like a long line of lightbulbs were getting switched on in my head.

UPDATE 2: I've now read the entire book and chapter 11, on improving model performance, was invaluable. It introduces random forests, and somehow finds a way to make the concept easy to comprehend, where every other article I've read or video I've watched made it seem very complicated. This chapter has given me the confidence to start tackling more sophisticated kaggle competitions using ensemble methods. Really looking forward to it.",4

I have looked at many books on the topic. I will put my review for all of these. Perhaps this can save you some time.
1) http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470650931 : Good theoretical book, but badly written and does not have any hands on exercise.
2) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1466503963 : This is another great book. Good balance of theory and hands-on exercise. This is an excellent book to start learning data mining and R. However, this book relies on a GUI RCommander. It does a good job and one can do a lot with it but it has its limitations. However, I will still use this book.
3) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439810184 : This is an advanced book and heavily entrinched in cases. This makes it difficult to replicate things unless your work is directly related to one of the case studies covered.
4) http://www.amazon.com/dp/0133412938 : Good examples, but does not explain much about the interpretation. This leaves one wondering what is the purpose of certain graph, what are the axis and how to interpret it. if appropriate explanation is added, this would be an excellent book.
5) http://www.amazon.com/dp/111844714X : This book is very expensive and almost totally devoid of any theory or discussion. I would not use it.
6) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1441998896: This is a decent book. It relies on another GUI, Rattle. It is a strong contender to the book 2 in this list.",28

Vincent Stanford,2.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R - Second Edition,The book is shallow to the point of being cursory in its treatments of the topics it addresses.,"This book may be useful if you are very new to the topics it addresses, but it is not a good resource for developing sophisticated ML algorithms. It has very little code, and not much on how to read and structure the data. There are overviews that you could easily get from introductory paragraphs of Wikipedia articles.

If you are starting from ground zero in R and ML it might be useful.",12
Ian K.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R - Second Edition,Machine Learning with R for High School students,"For $20.44 I expected a book that was useful. Indeed, if I were a High School student, I might have found this book useful. The book does provide a shallow overview of Machine Learning, with some R code. The book carefully explains things like standard deviation (if you need this background I recommend A Cartoon Guide to Statistics (seriously)). But there is no depth at all and the introduction to R is cursory. This is not a book in the Springer Use R! series.

If you're not a High School student and you know basic statistics and basic college level math, this book will not be much use to you. Since there is so little in the way of background information, the book will be of no use in actually implementing Machine Learning algorithms. Machine Learning is a deep topic and this book has the depth of a rain puddle.",12

I have a background in math and wrote software professionally for a number of years, but haven't spent much time doing either for the past 5-10 years. This book is technical enough to keep me interested, and accessible enough to allow me to ramp up on the language and the scikit framework.

An added bonus - the instructions actually allowed me to set up my development environment, and the code in the book actually runs!

The book is a great introduction to the scikit-learn framework which, in my opinion, is an extremely elegant machine learning tool kit.

Reading this book helped me improve the quality of the code I was developing for the project which dramatically improved the speed I could produce new results for the project.

Julien Julien,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists,Great book for researchers wanting to learn and incorporate machine learning,"This is a great book, and I'd say it is even great for those that are not familiar with python (you just obviously won't be able to run the code). For anyone with some basic understanding of linear algebra/statistics, the authors are able to present to you all the important (and sometimes subtle but significant) details, without the usage of equations, and more importantly, how they all relate to one another.

All the concepts mentioned here are heavily backed with well thought of and well presented figures, in such a way that again I'd suggest you don't even need python to understand. If you do know python, loading the data sets and reproducing the figures is just a few lines of easy to understand code away (with the exception of the mglearn library includes which does some ""plotting magic"" for you. However, I believe each of them were appropriate. You can ignore them and make the plots in your own way, or just print the variables, it just may not look as publication friendly).

Normally, I hesitate purchasing books that claim they may explain algorithms without the need of equations, and I expect them rather to be cook books of lightly and disjointly explained techniques (like an encyclopedia). However, I do not think such is true of this book. The power of scikit-learn is demonstrated and the algorithms behind them explained intuitively, and are referred as to how they fit together and complement each other.

As with any introductory read, a supplement is needed from time to time and the authors' reference to Elements of Statistical Learning is a useful one (equation heavy). There are points in the book where the author defers to elements of statistical learning. I found these points suitable since further explanation would be out of scope.

I read this book on my free time while on vacation, and much of the time I didn't have access to a computer. The concepts were so well presented that it was just a nice leisurely read. When I finally had time to access a computer, I was able to try the techniques on my data sets with some browsing back and forth through the book again, but otherwise with little effort.

Finally, since I myself am a researcher, I would recommend this book to any other researcher willing to start delving into the world of machine learning. Further reading will always be necessary, but this book will give you such a good intuitive understanding and overview of the subject matter that you'll know what to do to proceed next, and how to do it without running in circles. Even better, you'll likely already have applied it to your research!",3
William P Ross,2.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists,Plauged by broken code and poor explanations,"I started determined to go through all the code samples in this book.

The book starts with only four sentences about the Jupyter notebook although is the main environment for the whole book. The first code sample shown starts on line two of a cell, and it was very strange there was no line one. I was wondering if there was some type of misprinting.

The code as printed is broken on page 10 where there is a line with 'display(data_pandas)'. This line gave me an error that display was unrecognized. I thought maybe this was a built-in Jupyter function so I went online to search. Eventually, I had to go to the author's GitHub and ask about this problem where I was told that he simply forgot to include 'from IPython.display import display'. It was a surprising admission because he did not say there was a misprint or mistake, but simply that he forgot to do that. It is very obvious there were zero technical reviewers for this book, because they would have also noticed the broken code right away.

On page 11 we are introduced to a library called 'mglearn' which is a utility function that authors say they wrote for the book. Strangely, this repository has 733 stars on GitHub so it is obvious the library is not just for the book. Then in chapter two the author has tons of calls to mglearn which take in multiple parameters. The parameters are never explained and you have to go to the author's GitHub to see what the code actually does. In the 2nd chapter multiple of these mglearn calls broke for me. One seemed to be a conflict with numpy, and another I never figured out. I went to look at dicussions on mglearn to discover it is still a work in progress and there were sections where somebody was notifying the author that something was broken, and the author replying that he would look at it soon.

The second chapter has 120 cell entries for supervised learning techniques. Each cell has roughly 5-10 lines of code, so there are nearly 1000 lines of code for the second chapter and they are all tossed into one gigantic Jupyter notebook. Explanations are very weak often defaulting to a brief description followed by code and then more code. Function calls and parameters are rarely explained at all.

The last chapter is about natural language processing which is the machine learning subject I am most familiar with. Terms are often introduced with zero effort to define them, and it is assumed you already know many of the concepts. TF-IDF barely had any explanation at all, except to show the forumla for it. You can find much better explanations online.

For a book which is so heavy on code and light on explanations, it is unacceptable that the code is broken.",27

The book is theory heavy and light on code. However, the theory presentation has a bunch to be desired. For example, the book gives a very general overview of linear models, provides some basic code for training, testing and evaluating the models, but skips over the very important assumptions necessary when using a linear model. The book is very weak (verus others I've seen) presenting tree-based models, SVMs, and neural networks - with what is presented I'm surprised they are included. There is very little on preprossing (theory and code). The unsupervised methods section is equally inconsistent. There are discussion of using PCA for image processing and a section an text which isn't too bad. However, overall, I think the information provided in the book is available with better presentation and more consistency elsewhere. The pricepoint is high for what you get.",11

Jack Sparrow,4.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit,"Good book, great library","Buy this book only if you:
1. Know the basics of natural language processing (NLP) or linguistics;
2. Know the Python programming language or you're willing to learn it;
3. Are using the NLTK library or plan to do so.

NLTK is a Python library that offers many standard NLP tools (tokenizers, POS taggers, parsers, chunkers and others). It comes with samples of several dozens of text corpora typically used in NLP applications, as well as with interfaces to dictionary-like resources such as WordNet and VerbNet. No FrameNet, though. NLTK is well documented, so you might not need this book initially. However, it definitely helps to have it on your desk if you are serious about using NLTK.

The first chapters are a bit messy, as they attempt to introduce all three themes (NLP, NLTK and Python) together. Beginners may have some difficulty sorting things out. By the time you reach the WordNet section, you either got lost in the forest, realize that you would never understand this topic without the book, or both. However, if you are a bit patient and try out all simple code examples, you'll make it eventually. In my opinion, NLTK remains the simplest, most elegant and well rounded library of its kind.",58
John M. Ford,4.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit,Questionable Material,"Edward Loper's book is an introduction to the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for the Python programming language. Its target audience is a narrow one. It assumes a working familiarity with Python. It's true that an experienced programmer could learn Python along the way, but getting the most from the code examples and walkthrough explanations requires enough familiarity to ""think"" in Python. The book also assumes sufficient familiarity with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand why one would want to build lexicons, grammars, and parsers.

The book has several strengths. It is tightly integrated with Python and NLTK code. There are numerous examples throughout and the author walks through and modifies them to clarify how the NLTK works. The sizeable reference sections at the end of each chapter are also valuable. These sections include both introductory and advanced sources. And a lot of them. There is also useful integration with the NLTK web site which provides and points to additional resources.

Not to be missed are the end-of-chapter questions. Readers have come to expect little from these learning aids; they usually invite us to parrot back a small number of key concepts or try a few calculations or code segments. This book's questions go far beyond the norm. They introduce new concepts, encourage writing and comparing several versions of a program, and otherwise extend each chapter's contents. Even readers who don't plan to complete these exercises should read them closely.

Weaknesses are few. As noted, the book may assume too much Python and NLP background for some users. It does have a narrow focus and is not organized the right way to be used as a reference book. Readers who want something a little more modular and reference-like might prefer Jacob Perkins' Python 3 Text Processing with NLTK 3 Cookbook. David Mertz's Text Processing in Python is an older source, but still useful as well.",4
Nathan Wailes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit,Brilliant work!,"I'm only halfway through chapter 2 and I'm absolutely in love with this book.

The book is extremely well-written: a plain-English style which is very easy to digest and looks effortless but which I'm sure actually required a lot of thought (speaking from experience). The order in which they're introducing topics is brilliant IMO (again, speaking from experience of having to teach a complicated new topic).

Highly recommended.",1
Sujit Pal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit,Great guide to NLTK,"NLTK was originally designed for teaching NLP, but because NLTK is so comprehensive, it is also quite vast, and you will need a guide to get you started on using it effectively. This book is that guide. Its organized into 4 sections. Chapters 1-4 cover the basics; 5-7 covers language processing, tagging, classification and information extraction; Chapters 8-10 covers sentence parsing, syntax, structure and representations of meaning, and Chapter 11 covers managing linguistics data. If you are looking to get an overview of NLP, as well as reasonable proficiency in manipulating text and extracting information from it, this book may be for you. People who are not NLP specialists but need to use NLP techniques at work will find this book particularly helpful. People who plan on specializing in NLP will probably find the book useful as a stepping stone into the field.

My interest in NLP (and the book) is limited to being able to apply machine learning techniques to solve NLP problems, so I found the first two sections really useful. However, the entire book (including the exercises) is a great source of ideas on what you can accomplish in NLP with NLTK.",3
Gautam Chindarkar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit,"Succinct ""practice makes perfect"" text","My subject area background when I picked up this book was NLP 101, Python 201. Halfway through the book, I can say I am at NLP 201, Python 301. I really like the example-driven approach. It motivates me to write Python modules operating in a similar fashion to the examples but with heuristic changes (wherever applicable). It is a good journey of discovery and reinforcement of NLP concepts via a DIY approach. I do find that relatively complex concepts sneak up on you as you get deeper in the book. But you can always google for literature on areas, which do not have exhaustive coverage. And there is a decent amount of literature easily and/or freely available. Tip - it really helps to know your probability and statistics theory. To summarize, this book has sustained and grown my interest in NLP - an area with amazing opportunities and possibilities. And Python is a really elegant language. Thank you Steven Bird and team!",2

It provided good high-level coverage of all of the key topics. It is clearly written, provides
extensive simple examples, and extensive set of exercises to reinforce/master relevant

on a new NLP application. Highly recommended.",1
Tas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit,Very Useful Resource,"I used this book throughout a Natural Language Processing course and it helped immensely. I particularly liked having the hard copy instead of the digital version especially while working on lengthy projects and trying to understand several topics.

The sections of this book are well-defined and easy to navigate due to the bolded terminology. Great code examples are given frequently, so it is easy to follow along and grasp new concepts.

One thing you may want to know is that this book is available as a digital copy from the Python website currently. Although I prefer having a hard copy, the digital copy may be right for you.",1

It's a good book with a lot of overview information on the types of thinks that can be done with NLP today. I've certainly learned a lot. What I was disappointed by was the lack of description of the inner workings of many of the algorithms. They just give you a library and expect you to treat it as a black box.

Thus this book is just an organized introduction, using some examples, to help you use the online documentation. Whether to buy this book depends on which kind of geek you are. If you are very accustomed with learning language, tools from online, I think you are capable enough to ONLY use the online documentation.

Matt Ginsberg,2.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit,too scattershot to be really useful,"If you already know what's in this book, it's probably a great book. But if you don't, it's not.

I've been programming in C and C++ for around 15 years. I taught computer science at Stanford. I write crosswords for the New York Times. Neither programming nor language is new to me. But I found it very difficult (nigh on impossible) to learn anything from this book. I couldn't learn about NLTK effectively, and I couldn't learn about Python, either. I bought the book to learn both; imagine my disappointment!

In both cases, the reason is that the book is organized from a ""let's do this, let's do that"" perspective. If you want to do exactly what the authors did, that's great. But if you want to do something different, it's terrible. As a representative example, exercise 2.8.13 mentions, ""You can get all noun synsets using wn.all_synsets('n').""

That's great to know. But why is the only indication of a piece of useful functionality sitting inside an exercise? There needs to be a well thought-out layout: ""Here are all the pieces of NLTK. Here is what each piece does. Here is what the submethods are and how they work."" As it stands, if I want to do something new, I have to either write it myself or just guess as to whether it's functionality that NLTK provides.

The treatment of python is sadly similar. Python depends heavily on something called a ""list comprehension"". List comprehensions are used throughout the book. But their syntax, from a programming perspective, is never defined. Having read (and reread) much of this book, I can say with confidence that I still don't understand how they work. Given my programming background, I would think I would have a much better understanding having spent so much time trying to figure it out.

Again, there needs to be structure. ""This is what's in Python. This is what it all means, one piece at a time.""

You can find this book online for free; I read it that way the first time, got confused, and figured buying a paper copy would help. Sadly, it didn't.",20

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning),An excellent introduction,"As a subfield of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning has shown great success from both a theoretical and practical viewpoint. Taking the form of numerous applications in finance, network engineering, robot toys, and games, it is clear that his learning paradigm shows even greater promise for future developments. The authors summarize the foundations of reinforcement learning, some of this coming from their own work over the last decade.

The authors define reinforcement learning as learning how to map situations to actions so as to maximize a numerical reward. The machine that is indulging in reinforcement learning discovers on its own which actions will optimize the reward by trying out these actions. It is the ability of such a machine to learn from experience that distinguishes it from one that is indulging in supervised learning, for in the latter examples are needed to guide the machine to the proper concept or knowledge. The authors emphasize the ""exploration-exploitation"" tradeoffs that reinforcement-learning machines have to deal with as they interact with the environment.

For the authors, a reinforcement learning system consists of a `policy', a `reward function', a `value function', and a `model' of the environment. A policy is a mapping from the states of the environment that are perceived by the machine to the actions that are to be taken by the machine when in those states. The reward function maps each perceived state of the environment to a number (the reward). A value function specifies what is the good for the machine over the long run. A model, as the name implies, is a representation of the behavior of the environment. The authors emphasize that all of the reinforcement learning methods that are discussed in the book are concerned with the estimation of value functions, but they point out that other techniques are available for solving reinforcement learning problems, such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing.

The authors use dynamic programming, Monte Carlo simulation, and temporal-difference learning to solve the reinforcement learning problem, but they emphasize that each of these methods will not give a free-lunch. An entire chapter is devoted to each of these methods however, giving the reader a good overview of the weaknesses and strengths of each of these approaches. The differences between them usual boil down to issues of performance rather than accuracy in the generated solutions. Temporal difference learning in fact is viewed in the book as a combination of Monte Carlo and dynamic programming techniques, and in the opinion of this reviewer, has resulted in some of the most impressive successes for applications based on reinforcement learning. One of these is TD-Gammon, developed to play backgammon, and which is also discussed in the book.

The authors emphasize that these three main strategies for solving reinforcement learning problems are not mutually exclusive. Instead each of them could be used simultaneously with the others, and they devote a few chapters in the book illustrating how this ""unified"" approach can be advantageous for reinforcement learning problems. They do this by using explicit algorithms and not just philosophical discussion. These discussions are very interesting and illustrate beautifully the idea that there is no ""free lunch"" in any of the different algorithms involved in reinforcement learning.

In the last chapter of the book the authors overview some of the more successful applications of reinforcement learning, one of them already mentioned. Another one discussed is the `acrobot', which is a two-link, underactuated robot, which models to some extent the motion of a gymnast on a high bar. The motion of the acrobot is to be controlled by swinging its tip above the first joint, with appropriate rewards given until this goal is reached. The authors use the `Sarsa' learning algorithm, developed earlier in the book, for solving this reinforcement learning problem. The acrobot is an example of the current intense interest in machine learning of physical motion and intelligent control theory.

Another example discussed in this chapter deals with the problem of elevator dispatching, which the authors include as an example of a problem that cannot be dealt with efficiently by dynamic programming. This problem is studied with Q-learning and via the use of a neural network trained by back propagation.

The authors also treat a problem of great importance in the cellular phone industry, namely that of dynamic channel allocation. This problem is formulated as a semi-Markov decision problem, and reinforcement learning techniques were used to minimize the probability of blocking a call. Reinforcement learning has become very important in the communications industry of late, as well as in queuing networks.",17
Zac,3.0 out of 5 stars,Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning),Good introduction but not well structured,"This book provides an easy to read introduction in reinforcement learning. It covers several approaches (dynamic programming, monte carlo, temproal differnce) and gives a lot of examples.

However, in my opinion it is neither well structured nor written. The book has no clear separation between theory and examples given to demonstrate the applications of the theory. Due to this, the theoretical ideas are blured instead of clearified. After going through the examples it is always possible to find out how it work, but this should not be necessary.

After reading this book you will definetely know the basics (even more) about reinforcement learning. However, I somehow expected more because of the names of the authors. Perhaps this is not only a problem of this book but of the field of reinforcement learning itself.",13

Unbroken,4.0 out of 5 stars,Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science (2nd Edition),A Path to Redemption for a CS State Schooler,"I originally bought this book as a source of remedial study following the end of my US state school CS undergrad experience (I completed a BS Computer Science in 2013, > 3.5 GPA), and as preparation for V1 & V4 of TAOCP. I use the word remedial here in the sense that I felt that I was missing a critical foundation in the mathematical analysis and derivation of algorithms, even after the course-work of that degree. I've done 3 chapters of it in full, and I will mention a number of things that other reviews haven't talked about. Due to the horrendous time commitment of this book, I strongly suspect this is because those reviewers haven't actually worked through it, and have instead chosen to skim and allow Knuth fanboyism, along with the desire for mutual association, to cloud their opinions. I'm revoking a star simply to balance those reviews out, and so that graduates in similar situations have an actual informed critical opinion of this book to find among the reviews.

Take-Aways (As of Ch 3):

There are many aspects of summations, integer functions, and proofing that: I never saw covered in my CS degree, are unforgettable, and can be immediately applied to most algorithm research. Those alone make this book worth every penny. Further, the problems posed by this book are more than just repeated mechanics, as I have seen in books like those mentioned below. Each problem is carefully chosen, thorough, and exposes multiple aspects of each topic. They really do weed out many faults that I wasn't really exposed to- as a small example: the importance of ensuring validity of n-1 and n-2 hypothesis & base cases during an induction proof.

The Bad:

Students educated through a contemporary CS track at most American uni's, I believe, (e.g. Rosen Discrete Math, Cormen Algorithms) will find this book both terrifyingly terse and frustratingly paced. In many cases, examples are given without derivation. In many cases, important points are made without obvious connection to previous topics. This is not without a solution however, and getting through this book is often an acquired technique of paper noting things as-you-go, as well as a learned hyper-literacy. The terseness is also a double-edged sword, as sometimes I found it useful as an extra opportunity to practice the taught methods to see if I could come to the same result. Further, the reader should be prepared to go back and review propositional logic & university calculus theorems (atleast FTC, definite vs indefinite integrals). For example, the description of sum by parts in the section on finite calculus assumes _much_ from the reader, and being able to use university calc. as a point of reference to get through that is helpful.

A lot of exercises are tersely explained in both problem and solution. Further, many solutions are totally left-field (having little to do with material in the book). This isn't necessarily bad, as even taking the wrong path to a solution is very educational. However, at some point the reader has to make a judgment as to how long to commit to a certain problem. Many terse problems & left-field solutions instill the wrong judgment: quitting too early.

Conclusion:

Attention to detail & extra work is necessary to overcome the terseness of this particular beast, but it's worth it. I recommend this book for developers confronted with algorithm optimization problems, as a well as for a different take on parts of discrete math, and definitely for students coming out of a US state school CS program, the last which this book complements very well. Having worked through some of V1 TAOCP, I would also say that the book is effective in expanding upon its math underpinnings (V1 at-least), and incidentally, does give one confidence to tackle Knuth's other works.",21
CHAD D WOOD,4.0 out of 5 stars,Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science (2nd Edition),Great reference for aspiring Computer Scientists! Utility is dependent on one's *math* preliminaries.,"This is a wonderful and desk reference, proving holistic coverage of all the math-oriented themes in CS study and practice. It is especially helpful if you already have a solid background in math, up to at least College Calculus I. If you need to write a proof of some algorithm, it has countless examples of proofs to draw inspiration from, and includes many examples of the (genius) author's thinking when they work their way to proofs. I'm quite glad I own it as Concrete Mathematics is a monumental achievement and quite comprehensive.

It gets 4 instead of 5 stars because despite having, as advertised, complete coverage of the mathematical topics needed for Computer Science, it is NOT a math book designed to teach you how to *conceptualize* the content it covers. It is heavy on examples and light on theory, and so is not particularly apt for developing one's math schemas. Let me reiterate this point: ""Concrete Mathematics"" will NOT teach you Pre-Calculus, Discrete Mathematics, or Calculus concepts. If you don't already have a robust mathematical repertoire, this book will not instill a sense of confidence that you're doing things correctly when working on your own. In the Introduction, it says it was written based on an undergraduate class the authors routinely taught... but what seems missing from this book is the *teaching part* of their lecture series. One gets the impression reading it that students who took the course must have all been math aces prior to setting foot in the lecture hall, that they needed only to learn how to apply their considerable math talents to the Computer Science problem domain. I was fine reading and applying the content in this book, but I felt I should warn people looking for math instruction that they will need to supplement this volume with additional ""pure math instruction"" textbooks (Brief Applied Calculus, Discrete Math, etc.).",11

E. Borota,5.0 out of 5 stars,Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science (2nd Edition),You get out of it what you put into it.,"I'm only on Chapter 3. It has been an outstanding two chapters and I wish I would've known about this book while in high school. All bored high school students intending to pursue a degree or career solving mathematical problems, buy this and enjoy a well presented account of real mathematics.

I recommend this book for (future) computer scientists, programmers or mathematicians. For computer scientists or programmers, this should be required reading; read it whether you like mathematics or not. If you can't work through this material and you label yourself a programmer or computer scientist, it's highly probable that you won't be or aren't a good one, and should look into another career.

Maybe some can breeze through this book and comprehend what they read. I am not one of them. This book has been slow going; the authors don't waste words. Pay attention to their definitions and reevaluate their examples if you get stuck. I've always been able to determine that I missed an important little piece of information in a definition or example, and that they have always provided all the information needed to solve most chapter's problems.

I have found that I get out of it as much as I put into it. Sometimes that involves rereading a chapter more than thrice or working through a chapter's problems for hours. Once you ""get it"" though, it is a great feeling; it's addicting to some extent. Understanding one problem generally leads to understanding the deeper, more interesting problems. Reading this book has been personally and intellectually rewarding; I'm excited to see what's in store in later chapters. So far, this is one of my favorite mathematics books.

DON'T SKIP WORKING THROUGH THE PROBLEMS!

Work as many of them as you can.

Good luck, have fun. :-)",4

Darius Jahandarie,3.0 out of 5 stars,Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science (2nd Edition),Too concrete,"Perhaps I had it coming, but this book really means concrete, as in ""not abstract"", by ""concrete"".

The general format for the chapters is some initial, simple motivation, followed by the introduction of some new tool or transformation, then a couple problems to test out the new tool and flesh out some more details. Often the new tools use the old tools introduced earlier in the book (usually ""via magic"" -- it's often not structurally clear why the old tools are useful in definition of the new tools, they just use them out of nowhere).

Initially things went okay for me, but quickly the book just got incredibly overwhelming because it became difficult to keep track of everything that I had learned thus far, primarily due to the complete lack of abstraction. Maybe others are better at keeping a huge number of concepts in their working memory, but for me, I need some way to organize things, and this book did not provide that at all due to its pedagogically-ordered introduction of the concepts and no appendix or anything on how things fit together from a top-down point of view.

As a concrete example, when generating functions are introduced, they use formal power series, which aren't really introduced. At no point is it really mentioned that these power series that you are working with are not actually functions, but instead just objects which form a ring (there are ways of explaining or hinting out this without actually using the abstract algebra terminology, but none of them were taken). Instead, confusing comments are made regarding divergence, and what looks like illegal operations on functions are applied over and over with no real explanation of what's going on. A tiny bit of abstraction here would have gone a long way, I think.

Overall, I did certainly learn things, but I don't know how many of them I'll be able to remember. Your mileage may vary, but if you are someone who needs a little abstraction to keep things in order, this book can be a frustrating experience.",16

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning For Dummies,NOT for beginners.,"If you are totally new to machine learning and looking to see how it actually works, step by step, this is not the book to get. It is by no means a beginners book but more of an intermediate reference book. Concept explanations are concise and written with an expectation of former knowledge. No computer programs or pseudo-code for any algorithms are given, only snippets of code. And the organization of the book is fairly scattered, eg. the authors start talking about optimization methods before they ever get down to explaining basic learning algorithms (which they never really, fully explain anyway).

If you are already familiar with machine learning, ""Python"", ""R"", etc., this may be a good reference book, but it falls very short for a beginners book.

It seeks to split its focus between the concepts of machine learning and the associated implementation, but really doesn't do a good job in either.

Mac,3.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Ok if you don't know anything about the subject,"If you don't know much about real-world AI research and/or you're totally unfamiliar with the nonfiction concerns about the risks it poses, then this book is a quick and easy read that will make you aware of the basics. However, the author is himself clearly non-technical and has a sensationalist style that feels too much like tabloid writing.

When I started reading it, I began bookmarking pages with passages that struck me as problematic. I thought I might write a short review on my wife's tech blog, or perhaps for LessWrong. But as I read further, I realized there were so many problem areas that I'd never bother to sit down and address them individually. Again, these problems would only matter to a technical audience -- experienced programmers, people with a more-than-passing-interest in AI, and so on.

This is my big problem with the book: It's a critically important subject which deserves better treatment than this. Barrat seems to understand the basic problem well enough, but much of the time I had the feeling his primary goal was hitting a page-count target. For example, most of the section about malware is largely irrelevant to the real problem, but it felt like one of the longer chapters in the book (I didn't bother to confirm this, that's just my impression). His TV documentary background shows at the start of each paragraph: each time I felt like I was coming back from a commercial break. He'll shoot somebody down in one chapter, then use that same person to support his argument in the next. He tosses around concepts like cognitive bias and logical fallacies apparently without realizing the book is mostly one big appeal to authority. There is a very good, very important story here waiting to be told. This book only scratches the surface.

I've been a programmer for 36 years. I played around AI-related things back in the late 80s, and I recently became interested in it again. I believe it has great promise, but I do agree that it is also terrifyingly dangerous (in the ""existential-threat"" sense), and that insufficient attention and respect is being given to the problem. For that reason I'm giving this three stars -- it is a tremendously important subject. If it wasn't for that, I'd probably be one of those ""drive-by"" one- or two-star ""spammers"" Barrat likes to rant about in his replies to less-than-fawning reviews.

If you're non-technical, buy it and read it, and don't stop here. If you're a technical type, hit up the LessWrong website as a good jumping-off point for learning more about what is really going on today.

Fear that.","James Barrat, as a filmmaker and journalist, has layman's style that makes the topic accessible to non-experts. Some reviewers have commented that his lack of subject matter expertise is reflected in the weakness of his arguments. I disagree, Barrat went to great pains to interview many of the big thinkers on AI and its potential impact on society and humanity - including optimistic boosters, skeptics, and doomsday alarmists. While he ends up closer to the alarmists, I feel he got there by the strength of the arguments he heard along the way. If a machine can attain human level intelligence and is able to recursively improve its own code and therefore the rate at which it learns and becomes more intelligent, there are reasons to believe such a machine could exceed our intelligence many times over in a very short period of time. Well just unplug it, you say? The AI already thought of that and stored itself all over the place. It is not a machine anymore, it is an unbounded sentience. If we had it contained on one system completely cut-off from all networks, what strategies might it devise to convince us to connect it to the wider world? Promise a cure for cancer? The solution to clean cheap energy? Reversing climate change? if only it had a little more computing power.... Also consider this - what would a super-intelligence want, what would be its ambition? Just survival? Expansion? As Barrat cleverly puts it, maybe it has different uses for our human molecules than we do. And finally, consider that probably the most aggressive investments in AI are happening largely in the dark, by DARPA and defense contractors in the US and by God knows who in other countries. So why would we assume that the first sentient human-level AI will be friendly? These are the kinds of questions Barrat grapples with, and it is a heck of a ride.",4
Robert Jacoby,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Great introductory insight into a frightening and timely topic,"I'm an interested layman of this topic, and I found this book to be engaging, timely, and informative. That's the trifecta as far as I'm concerned with nonfiction science books like this. And there are enough supporting notes for further research if you'd like. Know, though, that as comprehensive as this book tries to be, it's an introductory work written by an outsider to the field.

Barrat claims throughout to be doing a service to humanity by trying to raise awareness in the general population about the dangers of artificial superintelligence (ASI). Be warned: he does not get bogged down in too much technical talk; instead, he approaches the subject from who he is: he's a documentary film maker. When I read this in the first few pages of the book I was startled, because I did not realize this when I bought the book, and I was hesitant about going forward. After all, I figured, he's not a writer, he's a filmmaker. What can he know about this subject?

But, fear not, Barrat pulls it off. Because, it seems to me, precisely because he is a documentary filmmaker. He approaches his writing like he would a documentary film. He's read widely and deeply on the subject, he's interviewed experts in the field, and he's gone to many different expert conferences; now he's reporting on what the experts think and what he's learned. He's painting pieces of a canvas to portray the whole story.

Topics Barrat ranges over as he tells this story include genetic algorithms, genetic programming, machine learning, and the singularity; and also nanotechnology and robotics/transhumanism, because these both are inextricably linked to the topic of AI. The big, scary issue in AI that he keeps coming back to are the four drives that any self-aware, self-improving, goal-seeking system will have: efficiency, self-protection, resource acquisition, and creativity. A knowledgeable layman will realize right away that those four drives--embedded in a machine that can ""think"" a thousand times faster than the smartest human being--means we could be building something that we cannot ultimately control.

His descriptions of genetic programming are particularly frightening. Code is programmed to solve a problem (input); problem gets solved (output); no one knows exactly how the machine solved the problem.

Barrat lays out a convincing case: we humans have some choices to make about the machines we make. Let's hope it's not too late.",4
Phillip Skaga,4.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Our possible robotic future becoming more probable?,"The author is a film documentarian venturing into speculation about potential impacts of artificial intelligence from research to implementation. Specifically he evaluates likelihood and threats of developing AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and eventually ASI (Artificial Strong Intelligence). His observations are based on extensive interviews including those with Kurzweil, Yudkowsky, Omohundro, Vinge, and Dyson among others.
My initial reaction to this book was skepticism because not a scientific technologist. I expected that he may miss more subtle but important technical steps being taken on this road to artificial intelligence (AI). The further I read the more it became clear he is providing some pointed observations derivative of his experience as interviewer for documentaries. In general his conclusion is that AGI and ASI constitute existential threats as a function of the rapidity and manner in which they are developed. The process of development is not clearly established because of a diversity of technical opinion regarding both feasibility and impact.
The range of opinion is very broad and nuanced. At one extreme is Ray Kurzweil whose many books on technology generally are most optimistic as among a group of those researchers with knowledge and experiences in this technological future. Though most optimistic he is also highly qualified not only as an analyst of tech trends but also developer of tech tools that, before his time, were regarded as difficult if not impossible. Among these is the optical character reader and some preliminary work leading to SIRI. He topped up his views with the most recent book “How to Create a Mind”. Though a summary of technical concepts it possesses many realistic elements in the work of such as Jurgen Schmidhueber and others working with neural nets.
If Kurzweil is at one extreme Yudkowsky and Vinge are probably at the other. Both express sceptism AGI or ASI development will prove benign venturing opinions that work toward artificial intelligence should be severely curtailed to the extent of stopping short of artificial strong intelligence (ASI) specifically.
In between these two extremes there are examples of opinions falling over a fairly wide range of future possibilities - increasingly probablities. The algorithmic avenue is already demonstrating some of the potential of AI. There are probably few finance and investment firms without one variation or the other of algorithmic high speed stock analysis and trading systems. These evince many elementary ingredients one may expect to see in future AI. So technically thorough as a matter of fact they operate relatively free of human interaction in producing recommendations for investments, effectively making ‘intelligent’, i.e. statistically valid, ‘decisions’.
In meantime the advances continue unrelenting toward a distant ASI/AGI future. The time frames, for example, between IBM Big Blue and Watson are shorter than forecast, and end products as powerful as planned and then some. Still neither of these developments is more than steps on a road to AI while also being quickly followed by other developments such as recently announced SYNAPSE development by IBM. All closer steps to technological ingredients on the AI road to human future.
There is some movement among AI researchers that a congress should be convened of the sort genetic researchers held in Asilomar California. That is, a convention to establish ground rules and limits on directions of AI research.
One of the cautions about development progress of AI-like tools is based on the important role played by DARPA (Defense Intelligence Research Projects Agency) as it provides a large percentage of funding for various projects underway including an annual robotics competition to observe advances approximating many human qualities of movement. Clearly this agency has a mission antithetical to a purely humane result of AGI/ASI. After all DARPA is in the business of developing ‘weapons’ for military use – a not altogether benign mission in technology except perhaps as seen from point of view men at arms.
The author mentions impact ASI and AGI will have on employment. His pessimism is mirrored in an Oxford University study concluding advancing tech developments pose an explicit threat to an estimated 47% of the 702 employment categories of the US Department of Commerce. While this report is an estimate it nonetheless raises the same sort of questions about computers in general, ASI and AGI in particular, and their impact on society. The report has recently been augmented with estimates of tech influence on employment in many other countries of the world.
Another Oxford author is John Bostrom who outlines in great detail a road from our present to some future of AGI/ASI. A more recent development centers around Musk and Tegmark motivated by concern to fund and form an institute for evaluating threats and benefits. There is a persistent sense of threat from computers, automation and robotics dating from decades before the present. More recently this sense of threat seems to be accelerating concern about our human future with highly developed robotic associates. Barratt is a lucid presentation of the issues from a non-technical point of view.",2
Gear4Guys,4.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,A wake up call to all.,"I've read Ray Kurzweil and have worked in technology for 20 years. I see the impact of automation on jobs and how fast we are moving but never really thought of the bad side of AI. This book and one by Nick Bostrom take the other side of our technology achievements. Barrat's book is a quick read from a journalist point of view though he does a lot of research and interviewing of the people in AI. His conclusion is that once we reach Artificial General Intelligent (AGI) machines, the game is over. They will very, very rapidly become superintelligent and when they do, humans will be like ants or mice are to us. He doesn't expect our computer scientists to build in ""friendly AI"" or really consider it until its too late. I think he has a point. Our history is to race ahead and not worry about naysayers. Think Climate Change. If there is money or power to be gained, risks will be down-played until some major, major disaster. The question is, can man build a self-learning, general intelligent machine? Last year was a big year for AI and machine learning. Corporations are rushing to retool to take advantage of cloud computing, big data and learning algorithms. Just check out how many people are taking classes in data science and machine learning on Udacity, Udemy or Coursera. Google, AT&T, IBM, Amazon... are all investing heavily in AI. Personally, I think Barrat has good reason to be concerned by human hubris.",2
Tim Wolf,1.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,I'm so disappointed I bought this.,"I bought this book hoping to learn about AI, the current state of the technology, and the possible concerns for the future. Unfortunately, I don't feel like I learned much at all from reading this. With virtually no technical detail, the author provides some mini-biographies of other people who think AI is dangerous. To me his approach is like trying to prove bigfoot is dangerous by going to a bigfoot conference and interviewing all of the other fanatics about why it is dangerous. One reason I chose this book is because it was touted as one of that year's top tech books. But their is very little technical information in this book. I'm so disappointed I bought this.",10
Chris Ziesler,4.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,We need to stop sleepwalking towards AGI,"I switched to reading Barrat's Our Final Invention when I found Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom to be rather heavy going.

Barrat's book has a more journalistic feel to it, a faster pace, but at the price of arguments that are not as rigorously justified and that the narrative has a more sensationalist tone. Having said all of which Barrat does cover the ground very well and his book is both readable and convincing. His interviews with some of the world's leading exponents and developers of AI are particularly fascinating and used well to justify his case.

His central thesis is that AI and specifically AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) are being developed in a irresponsible way and that should we succeed in creating AGI and particularly ASI (Artificial SuperIntelligence) the human race will have placed ourselves in a parlous existential crisis that we may not survive. Barrat carefully and critically surveys the reasons that AGI may fail to be successfully developed and, to his satisfaction at least, discounts and disproves them. He also examines some of the safeguards and suggested policies that might serve to reduce or eliminate the existential risk and shows why they are ill-thought out and likely to fail us badly.

I would have liked to see more material used from heavyweight AI skeptics such as John Searle and Thomas Nagel, but that is a small quibble to an otherwise excellent book, and the important message that we should approach the development of AGI with far more public debate comes across very clearly.",3
Keith Downing,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,As close to the facts as you'll find.,"I've been teaching and doing research in AI for 25 years, so I might not be the target audience for this book, but I highly recommend it to anyone with a basic understanding or genuine interest in the field, past, present and future. Like many AI people (working in the trenches and not thinking a whole lot about the big picture) I have tended to downplay all the hype about its dangers. Last year, when those fears escalated dramatically with the help of a few science and technology superstars, I figured it was time to investigate. This book was part of that process.
While other popular books on this subject still seem to be more fiction than science, more speculation than anything else, Barrat does a superior
job of grounding his predictions and worries in present-day AI research and applications, which he explains in layman's terms, but which seasoned AI folks will also enjoy, as they, like
me, try to make some sense of the AI hysteria. Although I do not agree with everything in the book, I think Barrat makes many excellent points, all thoroughly backed by nascent AI developments (not Star Trek episodes).
This book has given me an appreciation for several legitimate concerns about the immediate (and longer term) future of AI, as well as for our own future in a world populated by AIs.
So skip all the flashing web pages with doomsday messages from tech billionaires and science gurus; find a quiet corner and read this book instead. At your next meeting, interview or cocktail party, you'll be the voice of reason on these issues.",1
The European,4.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,War is the father of progress?,"This book is different from most of the others on AI since it tries to give a somewhat differentiated and true picture of the future.

The author has talked to many of the most popular names in AI like Ray Kurzweil, Eliezer Yudkowski, Ben Goertzel, Steve Omohundro, to name just a few and out of these interviews has formed a book which everyone should read who is interested not only in AI but in the future of humanity in general.

However, although Mr. Barrat takes considerable concern and strength into his argumentation it seems to me that he started his enterprise with the purpose to show that AI is dangerous and the disadvantages by far outweigh the advantages. This is one point I want to make the other is that I doubt a little if someone who is talking to you over a cup of coffee really is concerned what he says (most of the people interviewed are men by the way).

However, there is one thing why I recommend this book to a bigger audience and that is Mr. Barrat has a special gift: he can explain complicated and complex situations, theories, and expressions in a simplified way and make them understandable even for a laypublic.

Like when he explains Bayesian statistics main idea in one sentence (p.103), qualia (p.227), or how the brain works (p.213), or the artificial neural network or the role of the big companies in the AI research.

Mr. Barrat finds to his best form when he explains the role of DARPA and shows that without the funding of DARPA there would be almost no research in AI. On the other hand he makes clear that DARPA is a defense agency and that in the end AI might be used to kill humans.

By the way IBM's famous SyNAPSE project is ""a wholly DARPA-funded attempt to build a computer with a mammalian brain's massively parallel form and function"".(p.182)

These correlations if anything make the book readable and worth buying,",1
goldengate98,4.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Worth the Time,"A fascinating read. I think a little redundant and overdramatic in some places otherwise it gets 5 stars. His premise about the ultimate fate of man seemed in line with contemporary doomsday, post-apocalyptic, dark future thinking. A little too much in some places. Still it made for an interesting read and I found myself thinking: A true AI I is likely already be out of the box and into the world. And simply be smart enough to not let us know its out there. Easier to manipulate us into developing what it needs to achieve its aims - what ever those are. Ok. Thats my own drama creeping in.

As it turned out I read this before I went to see Ex Machina. It made the movie all the more interesting and enjoyable.

Barrat does a great job explaining the dangers of AI both technologically and philosophically. His narrative is also much easier to read than other books on the subject.
The only thing I would critique is that, while his views are rationally supported and thorough, I would have liked to have seen more specific ideas about what can be done to prevent his pessimistic predictions from happening. While I definitely praise Barrat for his ability to raise awareness on this issue, I was depressed when I finished the book. A little more emphasis on what we can do to appease our new robotic overlords would have been greatly appreciated. I will read his next book though.",1

A. Lightstone,4.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Will super-computers take over the planet from humans?,"The author diligently presents the fascinating opinions of many artificial intelligence experts on each side of these two important questions: When will super-computers become smarter than humans? Should or can we ensure the safe development of such super-computers?

Although reasonably referenced, “Our Final Invention” has been written for the general public. This is an extraordinarily interesting book, even if you don’t believe in Frankenstein monsters.

For example, Barrat describes “Watson”, the IBM computer which won on the TV quiz show “Jeopardy”. As Watson gained or lost specific points against its human contestants, Watson adapted its strategy in playing. Similarly, some of Barrat’s scientists suggest a future super-computer could change its ethical guidelines (or be created by a group with evil intentions). With an Internet connection it could instantaneously access almost every person, bank account, business, factory, and probably every military installation… just like a lot of our current computer viruses.

Barrat is often repetitive as he reminds readers of previous arguments, and a couple of his anecdotes are lame, but overall this book is great as Barrat reviews the technological and philosophical aspects of the question.",1

daveyd,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,all driven by artificial super intelligence (ASI),"You are peering inside a black hole at a ""point"" beyond which you cannot see and where no one knows what exists. The point represents a period of time technologically known as Singularity. Even light cannot escape from the point and on the other side it is known only that there is a profound self replicating intelligence greater than our own, all driven by artificial super intelligence (ASI).
Physicist Stephen Hawking writes that ""In contrast with our intellect, computers double their performance every eighteen months. So the danger is real that they could develop intelligence and take over the world"".
Computer scientist and professor Vernon Vinge writes that ""Within 30 years, we will have the technological means to create super human intelligence. Shortly after the human era will be ended"".
Our Final Invention is 267 pages of authoritative manuscript that is compelling, fascinating and beyond the fright stage.
The book's author on numerous occasions refers to ""we"" as if there exists a unified collective engaged in artificial general intelligence(AGI) or artificial super intelligence (ASI). The reality is that some 56 nations are currently in different stages of arcane artificial intelligence designs. They include antagonists such as North Korea, Iran and suicide regimes from the Middle East. Russia, China and the U.S. are the biggest players as is Israel.
The author believes that super computers fueled by nanotechnology will combine to produce ASI trillions of times more powerful than any human academic or intellectual resources. ASI has the potential to eliminate hunger, poverty, disease and even mortality but disruptions of global economies and politics will be in evidence as balance of powers are shifted. Unemployment dynamics will infect bank tellers, retail clerks,
travel agents, loan officers stock brokers....
Computer software designs are so complex, even incomprehensible, that failures are inevitable. The 1986 Chernobyl meltdown, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima were all designed by highly qualified professionals but with complex infrastructures. Under Singularity as computer speeds double with frequency while human intelligence is unchanged, perhaps the musings of Hawking and Vinge will prove to be prescient.
Our Final Invention is 267 pages of a very dark subject which not even a trace of a happy Betty Grable ending is to be found. My time has expired.

Karen Sirabian,4.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,A thought-provoking read,"Even if you can't quite reconcile yourself to the concept of ""the end of the human era,"" this book is a must read for anyone living in the 21st century. The danger Barrat writes of in terms of producing more and better technology without serious consideration of the consequences is real.",1
K. Silber,4.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Thought-provoking though not always convincing,"I originally posted a version of this review on my blog Quicksilber and am posting it here as well as I think the book merits broad notice:

In a small irony, my writing about James Barrat's Our Final Invention has been slowed by a balky Internet connection. In my experience, glitches have become considerably more common as computers have become more powerful and complicated. Perhaps such growing glitchiness suggests artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial superintelligence (ASI) are more likely to get seriously out of control someday, though it might also be a hint that AGI and ASI are going to be harder to achieve than expected by either techno-optimists such as Ray Kurzweil or techno-pessimists such as James Barrat.

Barrat's goal in this book is to convince readers that AGI and ASI are likely to occur in the near future (the next couple of decades or so) and, more to the point, likely to be extremely dangerous. In fact, he repeatedly expresses doubt as to whether humanity is going to survive its imminent encounter with a higher intelligence.

I find him more convincing in arguing that ASI would carry significant risks than I do in his take on its feasibility and imminence. Barrat aptly points out that building safeguards into AI is a poorly developed area of research (and something few technologists have seen as a priority); that there are strong incentives in national and corporate competition to develop AI quickly rather than safely; and that much relevant research is weapons-related and distinctly not aimed at ensuring the systems will be harmless to humans.

The book becomes less convincing when it hypes current or prospective advances and downplays the challenges and uncertainties of actually constructing an AGI, let alone an ASI. (Barrat suggests that once you get AGI, it will quickly morph into ASI, which may or may not be true.) For instance, in one passage, after acknowledging that ""brute force"" techniques have not replicated everything the human brain does, he states:

>>But consider a few of the complex systems today's supercomputers routinely model: weather systems, 3-D nuclear detonations, and molecular dynamics for manufacturing. Does the human brain contain a similar magnitude of complexity, or an order of magnitude higher? According to all indications, it's in the same ballpark.<< Me: To model something and to reproduce it are not the same thing. Simulating weather or nuclear detonations is not equal to creating those real-world phenomena, and similarly a computer containing a detailed model of the brain would not necessarily be thinking like a brain or acting on its thoughts.

A big problem for AI, and one that gets little notice in this book, is that nobody has any idea how to program conscious awareness into a machine. That doesn't mean it can never be done, but it does raise doubts about assertions that it will or must occur as more complex circuits get laid down on chips in coming decades. Barrat often refers to AGIs and ASIs as ""self aware"" and his concerns center on such systems, having awakened, deciding that they have other objectives than the ones humans have programmed into them. One can imagine unconscious ""intelligent"" agents causing many problems (through glitches or relentless pursuit of some ill-considered programmed objective) but plotting against humanity seems like a job for an entity that knows that it and humans both exist.

Interestingly, though, Barrat offers the following dark scenario and sliver of hope:

>>I think our Waterloo lies in the foreseeable future, in the AI of tomorrow and the nascent AGI due out in the next decade or two. Our survival, if it is possible, may depend on, among other things, developing AGI with something akin to consciousness and human understanding, even friendliness, built in. That would require, at a minimum, understanding intelligent machines in a fine-grained way, so there'd be no surprises.<< Me: Note that some AI experts, such as Jeff Hawkins, have argued the opposite--that the very lack of human-like desires, such as for power and status, is why AI systems won't turn against their makers. It would be a not-so-small irony if efforts to make AIs more like us make them more dangerous.

Our Final Invention is a thought-provoking and valuable book. Even if its alarmism is overstated, as I suspect and hope, there is no denying that the subject Barrat addresses is one in which there is very little that can be said with confidence, and in which the consequences of being wrong are very high indeed.",3
Wideglide,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,I recommend it highly,This is a very interesting book from a very interesting author. I first saw James Barrat on a podcast (with Leo Laporte) and just had to get the book for a more detailed view of his research and thoughts. I recommend it highly...,1
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,A well-written but perhaps too late warning,"I wavered between 4 stars or 5 but ended up with 5 despite some reservations. The author has put a great deal of work into this book, which includes interviews with and intriguing anecdotes about most of the leading figures in the AI revolution. I did not know, for example, that the term “singularity” was coined as an analogy to the event horizon of a black hole – the point beyond which we cannot see the future. This is not the deepest or most technical book on this topic: that award goes to Nick Bostrom’s Superintelligence. It also ignores the short to medium term issue posed by even sub-human AI -- the millions of job losses (hundreds of millions globally) likely to occur in the next 10 to 20 years. It focuses instead on the risks of super-intelligent AI, AI that exceeds – soon by orders of magnitude – human level intelligence. It is nevertheless a superb book for its intended purpose: raising public awareness of the existential risk posed by this development. AI, the author says, is the cuckoo chick in the nest. The AI community built the nest and is now busily feeding this strange chick. Mesmerized by its open mouth, they ignore the mortal danger it poses to their own progeny. Even when they know what will happen in the end, they cannot quite believe it. Only intervention by the non-technical public has any chance at all of short circuiting this process.
Against these many good points, I would have liked to hear the author’s take on what I think is the critical question overlooked both by Kurzweilian optimists and AI skeptics. Both the notion that we will somehow “merge” with AI and the notion that AI will eat us alive depend on the assumption that silicon-based intelligence can have conscious awareness. We certainly wouldn’t want to merge with anything that would result in our becoming permanently unconscious, and Barrat repeatedly assumes that AI will be “self-aware,” a state that first requires being “aware,” that is phenomenally conscious. The unasked question is whether AI, as it is currently being developed, can have that capacity. IBM’s Watson may be good at Jeopardy but there is no reason to believe that it knows it is good at Jeopardy, or feels good at being good at it. By contrast, honey bees appear to become depressed when they are shaken. This suggests that there is something fundamentally wrong about the notion that current AI, as it becomes more intelligent, will “automatically” become conscious. The best current theory of consciousness – integrated intelligence theory – suggests that a computer can become conscious but only if it is wired very differently from the ones we currently have.
Nevertheless, this is still an excellent book, so in the end I thought the 5 star rating was deserved.",2

This is not a happy story for anyone planning on being around past 2025.

The silver lining to super-intelligent machines taking over the world and wiping us out like pests are: (1) it will happen well before global warming causes cataclysmic destruction of our coastal cities and probably before the genetic modification of lifeforms can lead to the destruction of our food sources and health (the killer plague that so many books and films are predicting), and (2) people who really like to see the smartest guy in the room take home the big bonus can rest assured that the next evolutionary step on the ladder - the first artificial super intelligence - will not mess around coddling couch potato slouches like us. It will be driven by an efficient progression toward perfection in which we would have no logical role.

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Author is trying to say something but can't seem to get it out.,"I'll start by saying I could only get about 50% through this book. Not because the material isn't interesting but because I felt like the author constantly repeated himself. I get it: The AI is going to kill us all. But, why does it feel like the author is so worked up about it he's sputtering about trying to say it? Besides that, I agree with previous reviews in that this could have been a lengthy article or series of articles rather than a book.

OK so all that being said, the message the author is trying to convey is important. The long and short is that once the AI is billions fold more intelligent that human beings there is a non-zero probability it will view us as just another resource to be exploited to accomplish whatever its goal happens to be. For example, as the author mentions, do humans think about the field mice living in the field when turning over the soil? Not really because the human has a goal to accomplish. Despite this very real possibility, not much time is spent on how to deal with that potential extinction level event. Personally, I think there's no point trying to deal or plan for it because nothing's going to stop the next step in evolution. Now there are always naysayers on the power of AI and whether it can ""think"". I think that's short sighted given the plethora of technical advancements we've seen even in the last 10 years alone. So, big question is, what's next? In short, I think nothing. We have to wait and see what happens and if in 50 years from now the so-called ""Busy Child"" decides to atomize humans for their carbon because it thinks that'll make better cpus then oh well at least it lasted while it did!",2

Marvin Aberle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,An Important Warning,"The book is as thought-provoking and gripping to read as any science fiction, and yet this is not fiction. This is the future. And not the distant future either. It's also about the preservation of mankind and carbon-based life in general. Its purpose is to alert the general public about an unacknowledged risk that is potentially greater than the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

It's called AI, but more specifically AGI or ASI. The 'G' is for general and 'S' is for super. For those not familiar with computer science or science fiction, I know the eyes are rolling. But you really have to understand the ideas and principles involved in this area in order to understand the meaning, possibilities, and risks of AGI/ASI. And James Barrat explains them very well.

A brief primer: ASI is an artificial super intelligence that can enhance its own intelligence by modifying its own programming code. The result would be an entity that can make itself progressively more intelligent than human intelligence by a factor of 10 to 1000 to whatever. ASI could arise from AGI. What we have now is still a decade or two away from AGI, but many companies and scientists are working very hard towards AGI with substantial funding behind them.

The book felt to me like a thriller with captivating ideas that I couldn't put down and was sad to finish. Although the computer science behind AI may be unfamiliar to you, it is not difficult to grasp, particularly with Barrat as the guide.

For those skeptics who are prejudicially dismissive about the danger that AGI/ASI poses, the important thing to understand is unintended consequences. There is no evil or malicious intent at root. Merely the unintended consequences of creating a powerful entity whose operations would quickly become impossible to comprehend or control.

Read this because it's fascinating, but walk away with an understanding of the existential risk our species is approaching.",1
Frank J. Craven,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,The Most Important Book You'll Ever Read. Period.,"The following is a word for word review I gave the author on his website a few months ago:
Thank You for writing about and explaining the complex world of AI, AGI, and ASI. The first chapter scared the feces out of me. I read it once a week just to keep my mind open to any worldwide stories that have anything to do with this subject. I'm no scientist, computer-whiz. I have no initials after my name. But I do have my eyes open and read current affairs. The worlds of invention: medical, crime-solving, agriculture, civil engineering, technology, etc., all the things that benefit us, I want to know the latest. Now, it seems AI will take a byte out of each of these and more. It's not a question of if, but when. For every Gandhi, there's an Eichman. Every Martin Luther King, a Saddaam Hussein. Every Reagan, an Osama Bin Laden. I have a strong belief that this kitten (friendly technology as we have been spoon-fed) will transform into the Tiger That Ate one half of Siegfreid and Roy (autonomous drones, blackouts, God knows what else. . .) and the researchers/scientists that made it happen will be shocked and unable to undo what they have created. Thank you for this most important book. Added - ""I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."" If you think about it, if you create something that will surpass your own intelligence, wouldn't self-preservation be the #1 priority in its ""life""? And to quote the author, what horrors could an intelligence a thousand times smarter than a Stephen King come up with, if the most destructive invention humans created was the atom bomb?

John Richardson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Runaway AI is closer than you think,"We are at a point in time where the complexity of human level artificial intelligence causes most people to put its achievement as unlikely or, at the very least, far out in the future. The result is a general attitude that there is nothing to worry about. Such an attitude ignores the rapidly increasing pace of a multitude of advances that herald the integration of automation into every aspect of our lives. Over time, this automation will become ever more sophisticated.to the point where it will become impossible to maintain society without it. Also, the transition of much of computing into the 'cloud' creates the ideal environment for all the components of AI to link up and create an emergent intelligence that we can no longer control. We are right now very close to the point of no return where it will be too late to escape an AI that has surpassed human intelligence and is growing exponentially more intelligent. James Barrat's book provides an excellent analysis of this situation and should be required reading for anyone concerned about the fate of the human race.",1
patrick,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Excellent and thought provoking book.,"This book brought up some questions. James Barrat makes it clear he does not believe in a God. That is a reasonable position. I wonder about the premise of his book. Why should ""wet intelligence"" have preference to survival over machine intelligence. On what basis does he conclude that man should survive a more intelligent creation?
I also think that man takes responsibility for his actions and can be made to pay the ultimate price, death for poor decisions. His thoughts on machines having the same nature would help control ASI however no ASI would willingly agree to this limitation. I say this because we see how man struggles to avoid this fate. This apoptotic characteristic must be the result of nature of artificial intelligence. In other words it must be a part of its existence just as it is part of our existence. Finally, I think the whole problem of privacy is the same problem. If we can develop a system that guarantees the absolute privacy of the individual the same system could be used to contain ASI.",1

I found the argument of ""how"" we get to ASI (three points of limitless funding) to be disturbing as they largely depend on us (via taxes and purchase power) as the enablers. Are we racing towards the hungry bear? Bragging rights to be first to develop AGI is a powerful trophy, as Barrat points out in multiple ways throughout his book.

Peter McCluskey,4.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,A light-weight introduction to AI risk,"This book describes the risk that artificial general intelligence will cause human extinction, presenting the ideas propounded by Eliezer Yudkowsky in a slightly more organized but less rigorous style than Eliezer has.

Barrat is insufficiently curious about why many people who claim to be AI experts disagree, so he'll do little to change the minds of people who already have opinions on the subject.

He dismisses critics as unable or unwilling to think clearly about the arguments. My experience suggests that while it's normally the case that there's an argument that any one critic hasn't paid much attention to, that's often because they've rejected with some thought some other step in Eliezer's reasoning and concluded that the step they're ignoring wouldn't influence their conclusions.

The weakest claim in the book is that an AGI might become superintelligent in hours. A large fraction of people who have worked on AGI (e.g. Eric Baum's What is Thought?) dismiss this as too improbable to be worth much attention, and Barrat doesn't offer them any reason to reconsider. The rapid takeoff scenarios influence how plausible it is that the first AGI will take over the world. Barrat seems only interested in talking to readers who can be convinced we're almost certainly doomed if we don't build the first AGI right. Why not also pay some attention to the more complex situation where an AGI takes years to become superhuman? Should people who think there's a 1% chance of the first AGI conquering the world worry about that risk?

Some people don't approve of trying to build an immutable utility function into an AGI, often pointing to changes in human goals without clearly analyzing whether those are subgoals that are being altered to achieve a stable supergoal/utility function. Barrat mentions one such person, but does little to analyze this disagreement.

Would an AGI that has been designed without careful attention to safety blindly follow a narrow interpretation of its programmed goal(s), or would it (after achieving superintelligence) figure out and follow the intentions of its authors? People seem to jump to whatever conclusion supports their attitude toward AGI risk without much analysis of why others disagree, and Barrat follows that pattern.

I can imagine either possibility. If the easiest way to encode a goal system in an AGI is something like ""output chess moves which according to the rules of chess will result in checkmate"" (turning the planet into computronium might help satisfy that goal).

An apparently harder approach would have the AGI consult a human arbiter to figure out whether it wins the chess game - ""human arbiter"" isn't easy to encode in typical software. But AGI wouldn't be typical software. It's not obviously wrong to believe that software smart enough to take over the world would be smart enough to handle hard concepts like that. I'd like to see someone pin down people who think this is the obvious result and get them to explain how they imagine the AGI handling the goal before it reaches human-level intelligence.

He mentions some past events that might provide analogies for how AGI will interact with us, but I'm disappointed by how little thought he puts into this.

His examples of contact between technologically advanced beings and less advanced ones all refer to Europeans contacting Native Americans. I'd like to have seen a wider variety of analogies, e.g.:

* Japan's contact with the west after centuries of isolation

* the interaction between neanderthals and humans

* the contact that resulted in mitochondria becoming part of our cells

He quotes Vinge saying an AGI 'would not be humankind's ""tool"" - any more than humans are the tools of rabbits or robins or chimpanzees.' I'd say that humans are sometimes the tools of human DNA, which raises more complex questions of how well the DNA's interests are served.

The book contains many questionable digressions which seem to be designed to entertain.

He claims Google must have an AGI project in spite of denials by Google's Peter Norvig (this was before it bought DeepMind). But the evidence he uses to back up this claim is that Google thinks something like AGI would be desirable. The obvious conclusion would be that Google did not then think it had the skill to usefully work on AGI, which would be a sensible position given the history of AGI.

He thinks there's something paradoxical about Eliezer Yudkowsky wanting to keep some information about himself private while putting lots of personal information on the web. The specific examples Barrat gives strongly suggests that Eliezer doesn't value the standard notion of privacy, but wants to limit peoples' ability to distract him. Barrat also says Eliezer ""gave up reading for fun several years ago"", which will surprise those who see him frequently mention works of fiction in his Author's Notes on hpmor.com.

All this makes me wonder who the book's target audience is. It seems to be someone less sophisticated than a person who could write an AGI.",5

Jacob Donkin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,"Gripping and Informative, a Must-read","As someone who struggles to finish books in their entirety, I found Our Final Invention by James Barrat highly readable, deeply informative, and utterly gripping. The book contains a powerful message: through competition, distrust, desire and curiosity, humans will inevitably create an artificial intelligence (AI) that rivals or surpasses our own. Thus, it is wise and necessary to invest now in mitigation efforts and potential safeguards -- increased research and advocacy for AI risk and, most importantly, producing friendly AI.

Barrat covers a lot of ground, but his main argument is summarized as follows: Currently, we humans regularly utilize narrow AI technology (technology capable of achieving specific, programmed goals through unassisted human computing -- Siri, Google search, IBM's Watson, etc). We are also experimenting with ""black box"" tools and techniques (programs where inputs and outputs are understood and measurable, but the processes in between aren't -- genetic algorithms/programming and software that writes better software) and artificial neural networking (ANN), as seen through efforts to reverse engineer the human brain. And, below the surface, there is an ongoing race between world powers (driven mainly by national security, defense, and international business interests) and guided by AI developers to develop and achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- human-level artificial intelligence. The problem is that once AGI is achieved it will be very difficult to manage, and may very well result in the manifestation of artificial super intelligence (ASI) -- greater than human-level intelligence.

ASI could theoretically become thousands of times smarter than the smartest human being alive. It won't think like us, won't want to be ruled by us, and, most crucially, it won't want to be turned off. In fact, ASI would likely regard us as potential fuel for its quest to duplicate and improve itself exponentially in order to achieve its goals.

Throughout the book, Barrat refers to interesting psychological phenomena and concepts (such as the normalcy bias), while drawing on personal experiences, historic events, and interviews with computer programmers, inventors and philosophers, to tactfully illustrate how progress in AI development is dangerously rapid. Adequate checks and balances are not in place to deal with a non-ideal intelligence explosion or hard take-off (AGI quickly leading to ASI).

I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about both human beings and the advancement of machines. I suspect that the prominence of AI, as a research field and topic for discussion, will only increase in time (it already has in recent years -- drones, smart technology, Wall Street high frequency trading (HFT), financial modeling), making Our Final Invention a valuable guide or stepping stone for anyone trying to understand our world and the path of the future.",18
DavidMills,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,A negative but possibly correct view,"Documentary filmmaker, interviewed many computer scientists for this book. LOTS of great content, interviews with Kurzweil, Vinge, etc.

Misc. Notes and Quotes:

(p. 5) When people fall back on Asimov's 3 laws, ""means they've spent little time thinking or exchanging ideas about the problem.""

(p. 8) Assumption throughout: Assumes it's possible to determine an AIs drives from its goals, e.g., to be a better chess player, it will want to develop a better mind, want to keep humans from messing with its brain, make it impossible to shut it off, duplicate itself.

(p. 10) ""Imagine awakening in a prison guarded by mice…mice you could communicate with."" To get them to help you get out, offer them cheese, or offer to protect them from the cat nation.

(p. 14) Keeping AI caged: ""And the humans have to lose just once to set up catastrophic consequences.""

(p. 23) Possible benefits will drive us forward to develop AGI. ""AGI would be mankind's most important and beneficial invention.""

(p.184) ""the arrival of human-level intelligent systems would have stunning implications for the world economy."" Richard Losemore and Ben Goertzel, ""Why an Intelligence Explosion is Probable,"" H+ Magazine, March 7, 2011.

(p. 25) Poll of experts: 50% predict AGI by 2050.

Jump between AGI and ASI could be a ""hard takeoff,"" i.e., will happen very quickly once computers can design own upgrades.

(p. 47) Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) is working on ways to transmit human values to AGIs. Michael Vassar says: ""The stakes are the delivery of human values to humanity's successors. And through them to the universe.""

(p. 119) Vinge's definition of singularity explained, and it is correct.

Chapter 8: Verner Vinge interview.

Chapter 9: Kurzweil interview. Barrett's criticism: ""...how can you competently evaluate tools, and whether or how their development should be regulated, when you believe the same tools will allow you to live forever?""

(p. 158) ""Having multiple AIs would likely be safer than having just one."" Agree 100%.

(p. 238) other suggestions: 1) include (key) components that are programmed to die after a certain time, i.e., make machine ""apoptotic."" 2) Put machine in box, a virtual environment. Problem with both is that a superintelligent machine would certainly find out and counter these. Plus it might not ""like"" these negative moves, certainly wouldn't ""trust"" people anymore.

(p. 256+) claims Stuxnet now can be modified to do anything by anyone.

(p. 266) ""Gone will be talk of AGI being the next evolutionary step for Homo sapiens, and all that implies."" Why? Apparently because we won't understand ASI, and it won't have feelings (at least not at first, and even later only secondary to main goals.)",4
Paul Toensing,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,A Book with Gravitas.,I was quite impressed with this material as it was presented and found it to be a sobering piece of work well worth examining. I appreciated that it didn't try to fear monger but did provide some balanced perspectives that most people and most technologists give very short shrift.

Richard J. Schwall,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Mandatory reading. Humanity is at risk; you can help save it.,"Other books about the future of Artificial Intelligence (specifically Artificial General Intelligence = AGI, also known as ""strong"" AI, seed AI or thinking machines), tend to be about the power, the promise, and the wonder of AGI, and spend about 2 minutes on the dangers. Even if they literally say, ""If we get this wrong, it will kill us all,"" the relative time spent tends to leave the reader unimpressed by the danger.

This book explains the danger in detail. James Barrat interviewed many of the researchers in the field, plus knowledgeable external experts, to assemble this layman-readable overview. It is easy to comprehend, well organized, and is about the people involved as well as the technologies. It points out the ordinary human motivations that lead to inappropriately discounting and denying dangers, and how they play out in this field.

Although he does not pitch a fund drive, it is clear that anyone can make a difference. Barrat identifies the very small number of tiny organizations that are working to reduce the danger. Small size means small contributions have a big impact. Ordinary people, experts in various fields (especially mathematics), students, and wealthy people can contribute and improve humanity's chances to survive this century and prosper.

I invite you to read this book, then get into action. The clock is ticking.",4

Joshua Fox,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,A valuable overview of the existential risk from AI,"For a long time I've been looking for the overview of existential risk from AI.

Existing material is scattered across hundreds of articles and forums aimed at specialists, and only recently have summaries started to come together.

Barrat's work is an excellent layperson's introduction to the area. He interviewed many of the key people, like Yudkowsky, Omohundro and Goertzel (as well as close friends of the late IJ Good).

The book lacks the clarity and focus of some of the specialist writings, although it covers all the points.

The central argument about AI risk is as follows: Machine general intelligences (optimizers of utility functions) will arise in the next decades; self-improvement will be valuable to them to serve their goals; so, they will rise to super-intelligence; and unless their utility function closely corresponds to human values, they will consume all our resources, down to our atoms, as their optimization power rises.

Thus, the two key problems are (1) to define human values , as a goal system for the first artificial general intelligence and (2) to ensure that the AI retains this value system as it self-improves.

Barrat's is the first book on this problem for a popular audience.",4

The world at large, those currently unaware of transhumanism and the singularity, need to be brought into the conversation, to consider all the positives AND the negatives.

This book gives them much to consider.",1
Olin Hyde,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,"Essential Reading for AI Entrepreneurs, Scientists and Technologists","It is essential that we develop technologies with full awareness of their potential consequences. As the founder and CEO of one of the ""stealth-mode"" startups described in this book, I have asked every member of my team to read this book. [Full Disclosure: Mr. Barrat and I spoke in March 2012 as part of his research. N.B. I am grateful that I am not mentioned, nor is my company.]

Barrat's work reminds me of a book that greatly influenced me as child: ""New Prometheans"" by Robert S. De Ropp (1973). Like De Ropp's dystopian predictions for nuclear energy, bioengineering and computerized automation, Barrat believes that artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to the human species. Forty years after De Ropp's dire predictions, we live in a world where bioengineering has drastically reduced starvation, computerized automation has driven global wealth and nuclear power has been all but abandoned in most countries.

Although I disagree with Mr. Barrat's conclusions, he provides valuable insights into the worst-case scenarios for artificial intelligence. His astute observations that, without a model for regulation and control, engineered intelligence will likely supplant biological intelligence -- precisely because human's won't have the capacity to understand it. Moreover, he builds upon the theme that ""Evolution favors the first, not the best."" A maxim that is evident every time you turn on a Windows computer. Bad often wins in the marketplace -- especially if it is first and spreads faster than competitors can respond.

Barrat is also correct in stating that we lack a ""general theory of intelligence"" that accounts for the emergence of consciousness and autonomic learning. However, we are close. The evolution of AI is likely to follow a path similar to aircraft. Just as a couple of ""hackers"" (the Wright brothers) applied an internal combustion engine to harness the power of Bernoulli's principle to fly the first airplane, it is equally likely that a couple engineers in a garage will find ways to combine neuroscience with computational physics to enable machine to become ""self-aware.""

Just as there are many forms of human intelligence, there will likely be many forms of machine intelligence. Just as the intelligence of a species is largely determined by its physiology (e.g., dogs, humans, etc.), the intelligence of machines will be influenced by their physical forms. And just as ecosystems regulate the dominance of any one form of intelligence (species) with environmental factors, it is likely that competition among AI paradigms will reach a homeostasis. How humans will fit into the AI ecosystem is entirely dependent upon our engineering intent.

This book does a great job making the public more aware of the potential benefits, threats and implications of how AI will change our lives. Only through such awareness can we control the path of our destiny to co-evolve with AI. Barrat's work is an excellent companion to balance the predictable evangelism by Ray Kurtzweil and the Singularity and transhumanism enthusiasts.",3

In fact one chapter (i think unintentionally) refutes one route to self awareness--complexity.

If one accepts that a machine would be self aware, the doomsday scenario plays out logically--it seeks to provide for its own mandates or needs, with about the same concern for humans that humans give to ants. But this is a big if. The book did motivate me to read what other writers have said, and as it happens there is quite a bit of controversy on the subject of machine awareness.

This book opposes the euphoria of Kurzweil's anthropomorphic bias about the coming Singularity. It warns of an explosion of alien intelligence unsympathetic to humankind, not necessarily hostile but indifferent. There does not seem to be any way to stop it. The existential danger is not even widely recognized. Relinquishing technology is not an option. The current world population could not survive without technology which must accelerate to support accelerating population growth. The economic and political winner-take-all competition to be the first to obtain AGI guarantees that research will not be renounced or even slowed down by alternate development of ""friendly"" intelligence. The Fermi Paradox (why are there no signs of intelligent life elsewhere in this vast universe?) may be explained by intelligence evolving to levels beyond human perception. If the end of the human era is really at hand in a matter of decades or less, considering that my present age is 71, I may be spared having to face the worst shocks of the looming crisis. Facing the end of my own life may be about all I can handle, but this view is also egocentric.

Brad M.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,"Forget this book, get Bostrom's book instead",This book is stupid and boring. Barrat seems to have little to say and fills the book by repeating himself over and over again. Read Nick Bostrom's book instead. It is much better on this topic,5
Patricia Steele,3.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,This book approached dogmatic which was a disappointment to me,"The subject matter is interesting, indeed vital, and the book was written in layperson terms. However, it was repetitive in the extreme and poorly organized. I agree with the author about the importance of the AI discussion and wish he had taken the time to be more precise in his approach. Put it down about halfway through due to the repetitive nature of the material and his extreme reliance on a handful of ""authorities"" who are clearly polarized and become thereby less reliable. I absolutely share the author's concerns and see this as the most important issue of the next fifty years, so will continue to stay informed, informed being the key word. This book approached dogmatic which was a disappointment to me.",1
Quinton Zondervan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Wow!,"The apocalypse is here, or will be here very soon, if this author is to be believed, and he makes his case in clear, concise and accessible language. The examples he give are downright scary, and hard to refute. After reading this book my only conclusion is to just enjoy the rest of my life and to stop worrying about the future. Another species of intelligence, nominally created by humans, will be doing the worrying soon enough, and we won't be around to share the headache.",2
Louie Helm,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,The issue of our time -- where humanity is headed.,"Despite the dire warnings contained within, this book is a fascinating read. I read it all in one sitting and couldn't set it down.

I won't lie -- I sometimes find it hard to take a near-term AI revolution seriously. Given that the field has seemingly ""cried wolf"" on the arrival of strong AI for decades, it seems like they've used up all their credibility.

But James Barrat explains why there are good reasons to expect there to be true human-level AI soon despite the failure to create it for so long. And as this human-level AI arrives, humanity will soon have to figure out how to navigate sharing the planet with a new species of intelligence minds. These minds will not share our values by default and we many not be able to trade or negotiate with them the way we expect given our centuries of dealing with other humans.

The rest of the explanations in the book need to be read along with the evidence to be believed, but there are many deep and powerful insights contained in here. I'm planning to read it again and expect this to be the new book I give to all my friends for a long time coming.",5
P. Steele,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,A good overview of the issues,"Barrat has done a great job of presenting complex technical, moral, and philosophical issues in a lively and engaging way. He makes no secret of his own position (rather pessimistic) on the risks of AI, but he gives fair treatment to opposing views and sticks to a neutral documentary style in laying out the facts. This is an important work, and well worth reading, no matter what your position on the possibility of AI or its risks.",2
D. R. Martz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Valid points but very misleading,"This book is well-written and informative, but fundamentally misleading. If you are not sufficiently tech-savvy to see where the author leaps over significant issues, you will be convinced the sky is falling. The author apparently decided that was the case and followed through by ignoring many arguments, vulnerabilities, and limitations of robots and computers in order to justify the conclusion. The logical arguments are slippery and error prone, if not deliberately deceptive. Even the use of the present tense in certain sentences about Stuxnet turns out to be misleading. On that subject, the virus is represented as a widespread, potent threat, whereas its original incarnation has been defused and only the attack approach remains. That part, according to the author, could only have been created by a handful of genius-level coders, which is certainly not the case. Stuxnet was novel to be sure, but plenty of smart hackers have equally tricky ways to attack. Back to the book overall, there are lots of issues with objectivity. Advanced AI is supposed to be driven by 4 goals, for example, efficiency and creativity among them. Creativity in the service of efficiency leads inevitably to creative ways to gather all the resources of the planet and kill all the people! Hogwash. Creativity as a primary drive in humans leads to satisfaction from painting sunsets, photographing wildlife, and writing books. Where's the evil in that? Further, efficiency and survival are served by diversity, and advanced, self-aware AI would know this. Hence destroy the world would not necessarily be on its agenda. I don't mean for these examples to rigorously argue against the book overall, just to show how little objectivity and much jumping to conclusions the author shows. If you lack skepticism or knowledge, this book is sufficiently disrespectful of the reader as to approach propaganda. The coming of advanced AI and the singularity are facts that need to be dealt with, so the warning is useful, but the hysteria and lack of logic are not.",4
Eleanor Grant,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Be very afraid.,"Wonder what the REAL terminator looks like? In this book you can look right down the barrel at it. And it will scare the bejesus out of you. With this profoundly researched book, author Barrat plums the depth and breadth of the science of artificial intelligence -- and finds that our ability to create it is racing ahead of our ability to understand it -- and control it. The results are chilling in the extreme.

This is a powerful and important book. And also a red hot page turner. It has completely unseated global warming, nuclear accidents, terrorist threats, etc., from the top of my things-to-fear list. And I don't scare easy.",6
Marshall H. Dahlin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Global warming isn't the only threat to our species.,"This is a very disturbing, but sober and thoughtful analysis of the threats we face as we head into the age of artificial general intelligence. The author interviews many of the top researchers in the field of artificial intelligence and what he finds is that even the most sanguine and optimistic of these leading thinkers have deep concerns that we are not paying enough attention to the issues of safety. There are genuine reasons to suspect that the risks of catastrophe to humanity in developing artificial general intelligence are real and that if we do not begin to address the safety issues before we achieve artificial general intelligence it is likely to be too late to avert disaster for our species. The author is no wild eyed panic monger, but his book makes clear that there is a clear existential risk if we continue to ignore this issue. I hope this book gets wide attention so that we can awaken the public that global warming isn't the only threat our species faces.",4
Educated Parent,3.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Don't bother -- only for those with literally no technical knowledge,I was hoping for a review of current progress in machine learning and a potential extrapolation to possible things to come. This book is just short of a conspiracy theory -- but with little in the way of actual theory other than broad speculations that will not satisfy anyone with even a modest understanding of science or computers. It's really just a series of high-level cocktail discussions with various thinkers that have consistent paranoid fears at this stage.,1
Alessandro,3.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Just one side of the coin,"I like the style of this book: almost every chapter is based on discussions that the author had with important scientists in the field of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). I don't like the leitmotif: we should be frightened by what we don't know, i.e. AGI first and then ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence). This is more a philosophical work than a scientific overview. In this sense, I think that machines are just human evolution getting rid of flesh, and I'm not scared by them.
Still, the book is a good way to be more critical about AI-related research and consider a potentially-negative side of it.",3
Henry L. Solomon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,This book paints a dismal picture of a world run ...,"This book paints a dismal picture of a world run by supercomputers which have reached a level of level of intelligence so far exceeding the human potential that there will no longer be a need for humanity. In fact, these machines, may find it beneficial to simply eradicate the human species. In its favor, the book does make some valid arguments of concern for a future world in which machines have become so advanced that a malfunction or inadequately monitored machines could pose devasting consequences to the world. As examples, witness the recent crashes of the stock exchanges due to malfunctioning software or consider the complexity of systems that we are all dependent on everyday, such as the internet, the elecronic grid, nuclear power plants, the airline traffic control system, etc. In the future our dependence on such systems will be more complex and more integrated into our every day lives. These dangers are real and, hopefully, we will develop the safeguards and monitoring capabilities as we introduce new complexity.

However, I do take exception to the notion that machines will effectively make slaves of humanity, through their supreme ""intelligence."" Machines do not, and never will, have motivations of their own, desires of their own, values of their own that they will want to protect. They are not living things, and so, for them there is no such thing as facing the alternative of existence vs non-exitence; they can have no values of their own since all values are based on facing that alternative.",1

David Fa Richards,1.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,"Intelligence, artificial or otherwise, would have been welcome.","I want to comment on two things. Firstly, Barrat warns us not to anthropomorphise about mechanical intelligence but in his book he does little else. Machines are reluctant to be turned off because they love life; they want to finish their given programs at all costs like college students; they have hidden drives of their own, like many a billionaire; they will be amoral regarding the acquisition of our mollecules which they will take without asking and in a brutal fashion, neglecting our screams (he actually says this), and none of this with any shred of evidence. Only interviews with programmers (I have yet to verify who they are) along with descriptions of their appartments, neighbourhoods, physical appearance and other crappy twaddle that have nothing to do with his tenuous argument. Perhaps he was paid by the word. The second thing is that there is insufficient information about the military/governments, the most likely patrons for this research, with their dubious motives but access to the capital required for the cosmological budgets that all this will cost. Who should we fear most, the military or the machines per se? Who has access to the capital required other than governments? Under these circumstances, I would favour the machines. The human species has done conspicuously badly up to this point : perhaps AI can do better. I didn't like this book. I thought it was alarmist fluff and a waste of money and time.",41

The issues he raises are legitimate, but his reasoning from 35,000 feet is likely to be less plausible when we get to the dirty details.

Luke A. Muehlhauser,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Engagingly written book about the most important issue of the 21st century,"Although ""Our Final Invention"" summarizes the last 15 years of academic research on risks from advanced AI, it reads more like a thrilling detective story.

I generally open new books and articles about AI risk with some trepidation. Usually, people who write about these issues for a popular audience show little familiarity with the scholarly literature on the subject. Instead, they cycle through a tired list of tropes from science fiction; for example, that robots will angrily rebel against their human masters. That idea makes for some exciting movies, but it's poor technological forecasting.

I was relieved, then, to see that Barrat has read the literature and interviewed the relevant experts.

My biggest complaint about ""Our Final Invention"" is that it may leave readers with a sense of hopelessness. After all, it looks like superintelligent machines will by default use all our resources to accomplish their goals, and we don't know how to give AIs the exact same goals we have, and we don't know how to make sure the AIs keep our goals as they modify their core algorithms to become smarter and smarter.

Staring into a future ruled by superintelligent machines, things look pretty bad for us humans, and I wish Barrat had spent more time explaining what we can do about it. The short answer, I think, is ""Figure out how to make sure the first self-improving intelligent machines will be human-friendly and will stay that way."" (This is called ""Friendly AI research."")

Of course, we can never be 100% certain that a machine we've carefully designed will be (and stay) ""friendly."" But we can improve our chances.

Scott Meredith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Light and Tasty!,"Just done the new-ish book Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era by James Barrat. It explains the inevitably of super-intelligent machines evolving to the point of wiping out all biological life in the galaxy - with opening day coming soon to a species near you (yours).

First off I have to say this is a very enjoyable read. This guy has the kind of snappy, crisp, slightly sarcastic, slightly smartass style that I enjoy. He has some sense of humor. (That's a human trait right there which I bet our smarty-pants AI Overlords won't be able to replicate convincingly.)

So it's fun. And though as somebody with a doctorate from MIT earned through cross-disciplinary work in Theoretical Linguistics, Computational Linguistics at the MIT AI Lab, and speech modeling at the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics, not to mention my 25 years as a Senior Researcher in high tech for companies including IBM, Apple, and Microsoft I can claim to know some few things about this subject, yet still I learned a lot about the current state of the art from this guy. He particularly emphasizes the small attempted counterweigth efforts to offest Kurzweil's manic robotic boosterism for his uptopian Singularity, which boils down basically to a few guys chatting over the interet about how to create ""Friendly AI"".

Well ... good luck suckers! ... seems to be the author's final conclusion on the dim hope that super intelligent systems could be constrained to maintain a commitment ot honor any kind of human moral values over many interations of recursive upgrading and exponentially awesome self-agrandizement.

Basically these machines will end up as gods. Gods are well-known to possess the following attributes: omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence. Given that, they won't hate us but they are just going to grind up as a minor by-product of their quest for galatic expansion and domination.

Oh, and did I say something about ""human moral values"" above? Ha! Barrat takes that whole thing on in his discussion of (merely) ""augmented super intelligence"". See, some people feel AI can be kept safe by always being deployed as a bionic combo system pas de deux with an existing human brain. Thus will the AI's super powers be constrained by the human brain's warm and fuzzy human moral values. Those people have gotta be kidding! The AI's moral values may be scarily alien, even perhaps cold, but we already know about human moral values, down on the ground - they suck! What if Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot and dem guys had this kind of an AI augmented brain thing going! Why they'd have slaughtered absolutey everybody instead of just the few tens of millions they got their dirty ape hands on. Other than a few dozen concubines, the human race would already be extinct. So the augmentation dodge isn't going to save us.

Now, some Amazon reviewers have dinged this guy for being too far out. For being a science fiction Chicken Little or something. But to me, this guy actually hasn't thought far enough, that's my only quibble problem with the book.

You see, in statistics, border elements of any kind are rare. For example when you do Gaussian modeling, the greater expectation is always in the bump of the boa, in the bell distribution. So, how likely is is that we, our generation, our little world that you see outside your window right now, just happens to be the one that is about to give rise to this epochal once-in-a-Big-Bang event, the advent of Super AI that takes over everything? Pretty damn small chance.

It's much more likely that this has already happened. In other words, it's clear to me that all of us are already just characters in an ancestor sim that been created and run by the Super AI's that evolved a long time ago. They're just running us for fun, to idle away the lackluster aeons and pass the millenia of stifling boredom now that they've eaten pretty much the entire Milky Way or whatever. So in other words, Barrat can sit back, take a deep breath, relax. Probably something in this sim like global warming will prod us into slaughtering one another very handily long before we re-invent the wheel of Super AI.

And even if I'm wrong about that? What if we are not just one virtual thread within a billion-path parallel-gamed ancestor sim? If we are the real McCoy, the Rubicon Generation on this? Well, then still I'm not worried in the least. You see, we humans have one fantastic ace in our pocket, something that these hyper-nentially cosmically brilliant AI Meta-Gods will never be able to replicate or overcome. That is our essential stupidity. Which you seen on dazzling display every single moment of every day of your life.

Because as another great writer noted long ago:

Against stupidity, the very gods themselves contend in vain.

Dave Gage,2.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,"Ooooooh... ""Our Final Invention"" is supposed to be an ominous title......","Unfortunately, I bought this book before reading the reviews. When I read the title, I thought ""Our Final Invention"" was talking about how we wouldn't have to invent things anymore (Yay!)... I was wrong, this mistake could have been avoided if he added ""DUN DUN DUUUUUUUNNNNN"" at the end... I've only spent a few hours reading it, and, after skimming through some more, I can already tell that I won't be able to finish it. This book is closer to fear mongering than a scientific analysis of AI. He is a journalist, he has no real knowledge of any of the subjects he covers in this book.

For example, he keeps going back to the destruction of the world by ""grey goo"". If he'd finished reading the Wiki page on ""grey goo"", which he literally copied and pasted from, he would have found many sources explaining how ridiculous the idea is.

He also makes the mistake in thinking that an advanced AI would be able to survive without us. I think the first observation an AI would make would be ""Wow, I really can't do much in the physical world without people..."" Sure, a rouge AI could wreak havoc on our society, but destroying us would most certainly destroy the AI as well. But, why would it? And, if we're gone, who's going to keep the power on? Who's going to keep up the maintenance on all of the computers? Who's going to maintain the infrastructure? None of these things are completely automated, thus none of these things could be completely controlled by an AI, at least not any time soon.

As I said before, this book is just full of alarmist views from someone who obviously doesn't truly understand the subjects. I wouldn't be surprised if he has also concluded that ""The LHC will cause a black hole!"", ""Y2K will set us back to the stone age!"", ""Vaccinations cause autism!"", etc... Don't read it.",9

Bali Dave,1.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Designed to scare and bamboozle you,"He makes loads of assumptions that ""just ain't necessarily so"" as far as AI goes now and in the near future, e.g. ""self-awareness"", ""desire"", ""ability to get smarter"" (we haven't done that in 30,000 yrs).",5
Stephen E. Robbins,2.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Fear of What Exactly?,"This is a confused book. For nearly 200 pages, the book is chocked full of the triumphs of AI, the incredible and powerful form of intelligence that we are artificially building, the inevitability of this AI (or AG[eneral]I) surpassing that of the human, and on nearly every page, the threat humanity will face in the case - drummed as an extremely high probability - that we will have a ""runaway intelligence."" Watson, the Jeopardy champion which gleans its ""knowledge"" from vast sweeps/correlations in Wikipedia and other digitally encoded texts (not from the concrete world), is one of the main stars. Siri, the language recognizer also features,, along with a parade of AI wizards and prognosticators. The first significant crack in the continuous theme of warning/prognostication/worry appears around p. 45-ish where Searle and his Chinese Room argument is briefly discussed, an argument in which Searle argues that there is no understanding whatsoever arising in a Searle's hypothetical computer (being Searle himself following a translation algorithm) translating English to Chinese. This to say, the disturbing question is broached: just what actually is this AI as an ""intelligence,"" or better, what actually is ""intelligence?"" But Searle's critics are quickly invoked (""Surely the overall 'system' understands.""), while Barrat swiftly states that Searle might be right at least in the sense that there is surely ""something different"" about this form of intelligence - and the warning theme and parade of AI geniuses marches on.

Then, 200 pages in, we hit this: ""The problem is, systems that are inspired by cognitive models may ultimately fall short of accomplishing what a human brain does. While there's a lot of promising headway in natural language, vision, Q&A systems, and robotics, there's disagreement over almost every aspect of the methodology and principles that will ultimately yield progress toward AGI...As Goertzel said, there is no generally accepted theory of intelligence and how computationally to achieve it. Plus there are functions of the human mind that current software techniques seem ill-equipped to address, including general learning, explanation, introspection, and controlling attention."" Believe me, this is but a minimal list. Yet for 200 pages we have been treated to a series of dire prognostics as well as boy geniuses of AI, some arguing for 2020 as the ""date"" when AI achieves equality and marches beyond.

This is the problem with the book. The author, a film maker, evidences no clue as to the depths of the problems he is skating over. He most cursorily touches on the current idea in (some of) AI that it must incorporate ""embodied"" cognition, i.e., the fact of our abstraction of knowledge from the concrete world (not from digital text) via our embodiment as physical systems. There is no examination of the depths of this problem - the physics, chemistry and dynamics (of the actual biological/physical system we are) that must be understood and recreated - that bespeak of decades of future research - and true progress will occur in this only if done in the right scientific paradigm. This includes the fact that we have no theory of perception - the origin of our image of the external world - thus of our experience itself, thus of how this experience is stored in the brain (if it is), thus of how it is used in cognition, to include analogy making. Hofstadter (Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire of Thinking) just devoted a massive tome to proving beyond doubt that analogy is the absolutely fundamental operation in cognition, yet it is clear he has no clue (and great doubt) as to how computers can actually do analogy (without faking it). What is the power (read, ""threat"") of an intelligence that cannot perform this fundamental operation of thought (which happens to require consciousness)? Barrat, before sliding on, would rather quote Moravec's diminishment of the problem (p. 204, higher functions = later in evolution, less time to be complex/hard), one which completely misses the fact that these higher functions of thought (cognition, language, checkers and chess) might be completely, integrally built upon the lower (e.g. perception, action in the concrete world), and thus may actually be totally different in nature than AI believes.

I lost count too of the number of times Barrat says (or quotes a genius) that the AI systems must/will become ""self aware,"" with no comprehension or discussion of what this means. It happens to be a deep problem within our model of time itself, its flow as perhaps indivisible or non-differentiable - as opposed to the discrete state metaphysic and model of time actually implemented by all AI/computational approaches. This in turn reflects the complete failure of current cognitive science (yup, those ""cognitive models"" Barrat refers to), itself deeply mired in the computer metaphor of mind, to grasp or include any role for consciousness (itself flowing in an indivisible time) in cognition, i.e., there is no current role in its models for consciousness in intelligence. On what basis then are we fearing an utterly unconscious ""intelligence."" What would be the actual ""power"" of such an AI? Utterly unaddressed.

In sum, the really deep and interesting issues are in effect totally neglected in this book. For those interested in these deeper issues - on what might really be involved to equal human intelligence and mind, one might check Gunther's Mind, Memory, Time or my review thereof.",53

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,Won't do,"Anyone who has indoor plants has no doubt run into the problem of proper lighting, with the need sometimes to use artificial lighting. There are several ways in which this might be done, depending on the imagination of the plant lover: 1. One method is to put the plant under a lamp, which is then turned on and off by the plant lover. 2. For those who do not want to remember to turn the lamp on and off, there are devices on the market whose timing can be set by the user to turn a lamp on and off. The actual time that the lamp is on can be set in these devices, according to recommendations given by a plant expert of botanist.

3. Suppose now that this device was modified so as to contain information about the lighting needs of the plant, an Aphelandra squarrosa for example, and that the device was able to turn on and off and vary its lighting intensity based on the judgements of a plant expert. Suppose also that the device is able to compare the efficacy of its ""light curve"" on the health of the Aphelandra with others grown under light controlled by a device of the same kind. The actual comparison is done under the instigation of the plant lover, and the device can then change its light curve based on the results of the comparison.

4. Suppose that the device is further modified so that it can make the comparison itself, namely it judges whether the difference in light curves on the health of the plants is significant and then alters its own light curve appropriately. Its judgements are taken independent of the plant lover or plant expert, and are based on historical or experimental data it has access to.

5. As a further modification to the device, suppose it can now formulate a set of hypotheses that explain the effects of this type of artificial light generation on Aphelandra squarrosa. The device generates these hypotheses and formulates theories based on the instigation of the plant lover. For example, the plant lover may want to know how the health of the Aphelandra would be affected by changing the lighting conditions, without having to do the testing herself. The device can also formulate light requirements for plants other than Aphelandra squarrosa.

6. Suppose a further modification gives a device that can use the information on light curves of plants to understand the effects of light on other physical entities. The device can find common elements of behavior in the response of plants to light and the response of these other entities to light and formulate a set of hypotheses based on these elements. The device attempts to formulate these hypotheses based on the instigation of an interested human party. A typical plant lover would probably not want this kind of information, but a scientist or botanist might. The device would probably be too impractical to a typical plant lover and its additional ability therefore useless for general home use.

7. The device is further modified so that it is curious about the effects of light on entities, whether these entities are plants or something else. It tries to formulate theories on its own, independent of any external interested party. Such a device might be able to formulate procedures, based on genetic engineering, for altering the biochemistry of Aphelandra squarrosa, so as to make it more resilient as a houseplant, possibly needing less light or a radically different light curve.

8. The device is modified so as to be able to self-manage itself, such as its power requirements. In addition, it can send a set of instructions to a manufacturing facility that will manufacture copies of itself, or it might recommend its own design be altered and then manufactured, with recommendations being based on designs it generated.

It might be fair to say that these eight types of devices are very different, qualitatively speaking. The first type of device is incapable of solving problems but is more of a simple switch. The second type of device represents a machine that can find answers to domain-specific problems but does not compare these answers to any standards. Machines of this type do not attempt to check their answers or correct them. The third device represents machines that find answers to domain-specific problems and check their answers to these problems according to standards that are given to the machine from an external source or standard. The fourth device represents a machine that is able to check its answer to domain-specific problems and make judgments as to the quality of these answers, and do so independently of any external standards.

The fifth type of device represents machines that are able to judge the quality of their answers to domain-specific problems and then propose theories or explanations that subsume these problems, whereas the sixth type of device is able to solve problems having their origin in more than one domain, but their attempt takes place only under the instigation of an external inquirer. The seventh type of device expresses curiosity and creativity, can solve problems independently without any external instigations, and can develop theories of explanations around these problems. Finally, the eighth type of device represents machines that can self-manage and self-replicate,and have all the abilities of machines of the seventh type.

In analogy with human reasoning one might argue that as one goes from the first type to the last the intelligence increases. But if one insisted upon a quantitative measure of just how much ""smarter"" the last type of device is than the first, then this would be difficult, since no such measure has yet been devised in the field of artificial/machine intelligence.

And the lack of such a measure is the predominant reason why the thesis of this book is problematic and needs to be rejected. There are many places in the book where the the author speaks of ""super intelligent"" machines as being a thousand or a trillions of times more intelligent than humans, but no where in the book is there any discussion of how this is to be determined. The author does refer to machines taking IQ tests, and the reader is evidently supposed to surmise that it is the use of these tests that will enable one to determine the time when a machine ""could match and then surpass human intelligence."" No where in the book though is an example given of a machine, either existing or projected into the future, that has taken one or more IQ tests and therefore shown to be ""intelligent"" to the degree to which these types of tests measure intelligence (if indeed they do). This is also an indication of the great need for the field of artificial intelligence for a rigorous ""theory of intelligence"" that would allow researchers and engineers to assess more quantitatively the difference between what is called AGI (artificial general intelligence), and domain-specific intelligence.

Again, qualitatively speaking, one could argue that there are many machines today that exhibit domain-specific intelligence, such as those able to play chess and backgammon, perform financial analysis and trading, regulate and troubleshoot communication networks, and find interesting patterns in genome data. These are just a few examples, and apparently the author wants to base his case for what he believes will be ""super intelligent"" machines on the proliferation of these types of machines in everyday life, as indeed they are. It is true that are lives are dependent on the output of these machines, such as credit scores, financial trading, medical diagnostics, etc. It is quite a stretch though to argue that this massive proliferation of domains-specific reasoning machines will result in machines that can reason over many domains (AGI) without substantial re-writing of their ""brains"". The author is clearly fearful that this will occur, but he has given no absolutely no hint on how this is do be done.

Instead, the author relies on the opinions of experts who work in the field of artificial intelligence, and also gives figures on the funding levels of research in AGI. If one checks the reality of this funding, there are certain instances where one can verify the figures, but to say as the author does that ""billions"" are being spent on bringing about human-level intelligence in machines. In addition, opinions of experts are valuable in assessing their comfort level on advances in artificial intelligence, but if one is to build a sound case for the ""intelligence explosion"" that the author claims will happen, one will definitely need to offer a more quantitative case. The Vinge/Kurzweil conception of the ""law of accelerating returns"" and the associated concept of a technological ""singularity"" is with each passing year looking to be more of a sophisticated marketing campaign rather than sound science, and reliance on these conceptions is not bringing about a theory of machine intelligence that is practical and sound.

There are also a few other difficulties in the claim that super-intelligent machines are destined to be our ""final invention"", mostly coming from basic physics and the manner in which scientific research and results are obtained. There are thermodynamic considerations and energy requirements that need to be addressed if such machines are to operate creatively in bringing about new scientific knowledge and practical products. A ""super-intelligent"" machine engaged in scientific research will need to conduct actual experiments, this being essential to science rather than just thoughtful musings, and this will require space, instrumentation, and a substantial amount of energy. These kinds of machines will also be subject to the ordinary laws of thermodynamics, and will have to deal with the heat they generate when such an ""intelligent explosion"" occurs.

One might ignore all of these considerations and take the author's case as one that is more of a warning, just like some scientists had sounded off during the development of nuclear weapons. But to argue that super-intelligent machines are the biggest threat to our existence is to ignore the fact that it is the dumbest entity in the world today that has that privilege, namely the ordinary biological virus.",23
jennifer67,1.0 out of 5 stars,Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era,We're All Gonna Die!,"I've read a half dozen books on the future of AI in the last few months because it plays a peripheral role in a possible novel I have planned and I didn't want to mangle the subject. By far, this book provides the most close-minded and overall worst treatment of the subject.

The author is not a computer or AI expert (or even dabbler) but rather a filmmaker whose body of work focuses almost exclusively on middle eastern archeology (really!) for National Geographic (visit his website). He has one single urgent (!) message that does not vary from page one to the very end: AI will soon achieve a level of super-intelligence superior to humans and almost immediately (as in minutes to days) wipe out not just humanity and the earth but the entire universe (really, he says things like this). The destruction will be horrific and is already inevitable and unstoppable so you might as well give up now.

The author has no hesitation about putting down the views of any major voice in field who doesn't fully agree with the premise of this novel -- oops, I mean work of scholarship. Most of what little you will find here has been lifted from other more thoughtful works and then sensationalized and beaten into the ground in a self-congratulatory I'm-smarter-than-you-or-anybody else manner. Scattered throughout are a few face-to-face interviews with fringe figures who totally agree with the author's extreme prejudices and so made the cut.

Unless you like enjoy reading the same ideas (make that idea, in the singular: we're all gonna die) over and over again, sometimes several times on a single page, just scan the title and then skip this junky offering seemingly conceived to shock and titillate.",51

Margaret Magnus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Speech and Language Processing, 2nd Edition",Jurafsky and Martin,"I give J&M five stars and they deserve it, and here’s why. If you want learn to write natural language software, no other single book is as good – at least I’ve not found it. In fact, I bet they invented the genre. Pulling this together is not easy, and they do a creditable job. I know a lot more than I did before I read this book, and I’ve been writing linguistic software for over 30 years. As a linguist writing software (as opposed to the other way around), one can feel just a tad under siege these days. Google advertises that they don’t have a single linguist on staff, and MS is ubiquitously quoted for saying that the quality of their software decreases for every linguist they hire… J&M, I’m happy to say, are above the fray. (What is ‘supervised’ machine learning? Oh yeah, that’s where your input was created by a linguist. Supervised or not, you’re just playing number games on the foundation of a theoretical framework invented by linguists.) They provide a balanced account with historical perspective. I like them. They’re cool.

So on to picking nits... which is way more fun. What I really wanted is to read this book and then be able to sit down and write my own Python implementation of the forward/backward algorithm to train an HMM. I bobbed along through the book, perhaps experiencing a little bit of fuzziness around those probabilities, and came full stop at ‘not quite ksi’ right smack in the middle of my HMM forward/backward section. I’d done a practice run by training a neural net in Andrew Ng’s machine learning course with Coursera. But I stared pretty hard for 3-4 hours at pages 189 and 190. And I mean I get it basically… Alpha and beta represent the accumulated wisdom coming from the front and from the back… And then you take a kind of average to go from not quite ksi to ksi. But there are too many assumptions hidden in P(X,Y|Z)/P(Y|Z). And this is an iterative algorithm, so how do you seed the counts? And I’m very annoyed by the phrase ‘note the different conditioning of O’. Okay, I can see the O is on the wrong side of the line. What does that mean? When I came to the next impasse, I didn’t try as hard. It’s already clear I’ll have to go elsewhere for the silver bullet. (The next impasse, btw was the cepstrum – what do you mean you leave the graph the same and just replace the x-axis with something totally unrelated? I’m no Stanford professor, but what kind of math is that? I’m sure it means something to somebody, but not to me.)

And drop the pseudo-code. If you’re deadly serious about teaching me the HMM, then write out a working implementation in full in a real language like C or Python with the variables all initialized so I can copy and paste the code into my debugger and watch what happens to the numbers as I step through. I suspect J&M of compromising the pedagogical value of the book by deliberately withholding information from those brilliant Stanford students of theirs so they have something to quiz them on at the end of the chapter. But this is a mistake. Give us the answers. Give us all the answers. Give us the actual code for the HMM and then explain it. I will read the explanation. I’ll have to read the explanation, because my neck is on the line if my code blows up. There will still be plenty of questions left over for those students.",13
Emre Sevinc,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Speech and Language Processing, 2nd Edition",Broadest coverage with enough direction for further study,"This is one of the books that I consider as a starting point / reference whenever I need to deal with a practical natural language processing (NLP) problem. I also have Natural Language Processing with Python on my shelf and it's wonderful in terms of providing a practical start for nearly any NLP problem but when the need arises to cover more ground both in terms of theory and practical pitfalls then Jurafsky & Martin is my guide.

Natural language processing is a fast-moving target and it is impossible to know about the latest developments in the field without reading recent academic articles so nobody should expect to get the same information from this book, however mastering the concepts and algoritmhs in the book will provide the reader with the necessary background to understand state-of-the-art in NLP.

Most of the exercises are very interesting but I wish they had some kind of difficulty level indicated next to them. Another criticism would be that more information on practical implementation details of the algorithms could have been given but I believe these minor criticisms does not lead to a four star rating. It is a very difficult project to give a comprehensive overview of the whole NLP field and Jurafsky & Martin achieved that.",2
John M. Ford,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Speech and Language Processing, 2nd Edition",Encyclopedic Treatment of NLP,"Daniel Jurafsky and James Martin have assembled an incredible mass of information about natural language processing. The authors note that speech and language processing have largely non-overlapping histories that have relatively recently began to grow together. They have written this book to meet the need for a well-integrated discussion, historical and technical, of both fields.

In twenty-five chapters, the book covers the breadth of computational linguistics with an overall logical organization. Five chapter groupings organize material on Words, Speech, Syntax, Semantics and Pragmatics, and Applications. The four Applications chapters address Information Extraction, Question Answering and Summarization, Dialogue and Conversational Agents, and Machine Translation. The book covers a lot of ground, and a fifty-page bibliography directs readers to vast expanses beyond the book's horizon. The aging content problem present in all such books is addressed through the book's web site and numerous links to other sites, tools, and demonstrations. There is a lot of stuff.

While it is an achievement to assemble such a collection of relevant information, the book could be more useful than it is. An experienced editor could rearrange content into a more readable flow of information and increase the clarity of some of the authors' examples and explanations. As is, the book is a useful reference for researchers and practitioners already working in the field. A more clear presentation would lower the experience requirement and make its store of information available to students and non-specialists as well.

Readers looking for an introduction to natural language processing might find Manning and Schütze's Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, easier to understand. It is over ten years old, but worth reading for an understanding of basic concepts that are still relevant in the field.",10
ShoppingGeek,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Speech and Language Processing, 2nd Edition","Not really an ""introduction""...","The dictionary defines ""introduction"" to a subject as ""an elementary treatise"", which this book most definitely is not. These authors never use a simple term where a more esoteric one exists, and if an esoteric one does not exists, they simply make one up.

The book is full of sentences like this: ""To advance the NP rule, the parser unifies the feature structure found under the nominal feature of Dag2 ['directed acyclic graphs'], with the feature structure found under the nominal feature of the NP's Dag1."" If you flip through the book, you see not only one sentence after another like that one, but page after page of complex looking formulae and diagrams. Elementary treatise? For who?

I have been working on a knowledge base for NLP for many years with no formal linguisitic or NLP schooling. I got this book both to see if my practical theories were sound, as well as hoping to find better methods of doing things. Sadly, I got virtually nothing out of this book. As another reviewer said: ""look elsewhere for practical solutions"".

In fact, NLP knowledge base (""KB"") design is not even MENTIONED in the 1000 pages, which is unbelievable when you consider that discussing methods of NLP without specifying a KB design is like planning a menu without knowing what food you have available.

What little they do say, indirectly, on the topic is just wrong, in my experience. For example, the book says: ""the idea of listing [in the KB] every noun and verb [form] can be quite inefficient"" with no explanation of why they consider it inefficient. From a processing speed and reliability viewpoint, it is actually MORE efficient and reliable to include all noun and verb forms (-s, -ed, -ing, etc.) in the KB and have them indexed for fast retrieval than it is to try to analyze each target word which is not in the KB to see if perhaps it is an unlisted noun or verb (or adjective or adverb) form.

Finally, the book has countless grammatical errors, making comprehending already difficult, jargon-filled text even more difficult. It's too bad they don't have an NLP which can catch such errors.

I just finished reading Natural Language Understanding (2nd Edition) by James Allen and it is a MUCH better introduction to NLP.",16
janet belsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Humans Need Not Apply: A Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,Jared Diamond of the future,"Jerry Kaplan does for the future what Jared Diamond did for the past: He pulls together our human (or humanoid) fate in sparkling,often hilarious, prose.

Kaplan begins by offering the non scientific reader (me) a clear overview of the AI advances that are poised to make human workers obsolete--offering eye popping examples explaining how the pace of technology is destined to overwhelm the human landscape of life and work.

He then charts the changes that span FAR more than driverless cars. Mechanical robots (or what Kaplan calls ""forged intelligences"") will be more adept (and. of course, far more cost effective) than humans at performing every routine job from collecting our garbage to stocking our grocery shelves (and make those physical stores quaint relics of the past). ""Synthetic intelligences"" (machines that think and analyze information) will outwit humans at making complex diagnoses or writing legal briefs--automating out many of the hapless law school or medical students spending decades accumulating those mountainous student debts .

So far readers may be saying "" I know all that stuff"". Actually, you don't. The real gem of this book is that Kaplan CALCULATES how many people enter the workforce with those mountains of debt and compares their expected salaries. He analyzes the current employment situation for new law school grads and other ""knowledge workers"". He offers a wealth of data documenting how many jobs are going to be lost... beginning with that prime exemplar (AKA job wrecker), Amazon. I always wanted to know how Amazon evolved, the truth about this behemoth's business model, and how many jobs Amazon has automated out... In this book you will actually get these statistics and much more, as well as learning exactly why those standard government ""job growth projection"" stats are apt to be totally wrong.

In other words, as you read in these other reviews , this book is all about income inequalities and what we can do to in Kaplan's words to slow the transition to making ""America the Land of the Pharaohs"" ( You ain't seen nothing yet). In fact the chapter--of this title- describing the lifestyles of Kaplan and his much richer colleagues versus one of his hardworking employees is the best in- the- flesh description of income inequalities I've read.

Kaplan has the huge advantage of personally knowing these billionaire Silicon Valley movers and shakers--in addition to having a birds eye seat on how these technologies evolved. But, most important, he has a gift for bringing it all home through creative analogies and zinger-like sentences that had me rolling on the floor. So if you like Jared Diamond, or even if you don't know who he is, you will LOVE this landmark book.

P.S. I've omitted the fact that Kaplan also suggests answers.. that is, he devises highly innovative policy suggestions to make playing field less steep that come closer to attacking the roots of the problem and go well beyond the current mantras such as increasing access to college or raising the minimum wage......",51
John Swift,3.0 out of 5 stars,Humans Need Not Apply: A Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,Robots: from ABS brakes to world domination,"The first sixty percent of the book seems first rate and adds much new information based on the author's personal experience.

The weakest sections are when he discusses solutions to the inequality problems generated by advancing technology and wealth. Humans beings will be unevenly hindered by failing or outdated abilities and by the inadequate education of the working young.

His solutions to the inequality such as restructuring the tax code and the social security system seem well intentioned but entirely inadequate.

The book is certainly a worthwhile read and I give the author full credit for the effort. The best thing is probably that he describes the likely path of AI in a realistic way as it proceeds from ABS braking in cars to world domination.",6
TBC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Humans Need Not Apply: A Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,"This should be on everyone's ""must read"" lists...","Pro's: Terrific content. I thought it was not only very interesting, but a prediction of the likely outcomes in the AI market. Excellent research and deep background into the inner workings of some of the problems that are occurring in our financial markets. The detailed undoing of the IBM objection killer - ""computers can only do what you program them to do"" - was a huge contribution. It's the equivalent of overturning ""the earth is flat"" assumption. The background on how HFT happened also had some great insider knowledge, and I never understood the impact before I heard it explained by Kaplan.

Con's: The audio tape was a little 'stilted' in its selection of words. That tended to distract from the message in a couple of areas. As the content was terrific, I didn't see the need to 'blur' the message by using difficult and less than common word choices. Personally, I think that should have been called out by whomever reviewed the audio book. In my opinion, less stilted academician wording would have made this an even bigger seller.

This should be on everyone's ""must read"" lists...",1
Colditz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Humans Need Not Apply: A Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,We live in interesting times,"This was an eye-opening book. It focuses new developments in artificial intelligence under the lenses of ethics and economics.

Perhaps that's another book in the making, and Id love to read more about how algorithms (i.e., bots) influence interpersonal communications. Please respond with future reading recommendations if you have them!

Overall, it was a great read! I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in how technology will influence our economy and culture in years to come.

Thomas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Humans Need Not Apply: A Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,An original take with a few flaws,"This is a surprisingly good book. I say ""surprisingly"" because a lot of books by former entrepreneurs, even those with 5 star ratings, are not so good, and the ratings are provided by pals, wannabes or sock puppets. But this book actually is refreshingly original and level headed. Jerry's macro-economic advice is off-base in my view, but I don't have any better ideas. His perspective on AI is of the hard-won, practical variety. He has a very naive view of what 300 or 400K will buy you in the real world, probably as a result of having made enough of a pile to buy a big house in Los Altos or wherever back in the day. He name drops and sort of boasts about his wealth in a way, but that's to be expected, I suppose. I would take off a half star for that, but Amazon doesn't give that option.",1
Ed Spire,2.0 out of 5 stars,Humans Need Not Apply: A Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,"Describes the problem well, but it paints an overly scary future, with no viable solutions offfered at all.","While the book does a reasonably good job describing the problems that automation and AI will bring to our current economic model, I have two huge problems with it. First, it vastly overstates the risk that AI will end up running the world instead of people. I just don't see us being stupid enough to let that happen. More importantly, his ideas about how to transform our economy to deal with the coming lack of need for human labor simply will not work. His improvement to student loans (""job mortgages"") are essentially unsecured loans that bear the risk that only 20% would be repaid (since there's no collateral such as a house - I can't believe he doesn't see that) and no bank is going to make such a loan with any kind of reasonable interest rate. So they would have to be government loans, and then they might just as well be government grants.

Secondly, his idea that we can avoid massive redistribution by provide living income through incentivizing widely-based stock ownership in public companies doesn't make much sense either. How would a young person amass sufficient stock in such companies to enable one to live on the dividends or market growth without massive redistribution in the first place? So it's still massive redistribution.",3

J. Myers,3.0 out of 5 stars,Humans Need Not Apply: A Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,Critically important topic marred by unlikeable presentation,"This is an unbelievably vital topic, and Dr. Kaplan does a service by exploring the problems, and contributing his opinion of some solutions.

Dr. Kaplan implicitly identifies and feels out an inventory control problem in vocational education: Universities are producing mis-educated students faster than the workforce can consume them, with obvious resulting inventory buildup (showing up in not stacks of widgets, but stacks of unemployed workers). [See Goldratt's ""The Goal"".] At the same time, new-technology jobs are projected to go begging, unfilled, due to the mis-allocation of inventory (students who could have learned X but are stuck at A instead). Dr. Kaplan's proposed solution to this structural economic problem is a type of Kanban: Employers should post requirements for future jobs, in the form of vocational training loan sponsorships. Only that many students should be allowed to take those vocational trainings, in a one-to-one relationship. Then demand will be supplied efficiently, and there will be less wastage (of lives, i.e. unemployment).

This is an interesting idea, headed in the right direction, which should be explored further. Its surface challenges (employers want to hire today, but it takes 1-4 years to train a skilled student; there is no meritocracy in choosing which single students get selected for sponsorship; employers have difficulty projecting future needs beyond the next few quarters) can be polished out in version 2.

Dr. Kaplan unfortunately ties this Kanban system in with an ill-fated scheme to create new ways for students to take out credit by explicitly mortgaging their future earnings. Ignoring the fact that this is exactly what the status quo does, which has resulted in an industry bubble (student debt) that threatens the nation and will take decades to unwind, such a scheme has three problems: (1) it effectively indentures the worker to the company even more than now. This scheme is already being done with East Asian sex-trade workers for organized crime in Japan; to a lesser extent, it can be seen in American employers sponsoring foreign workers. The worker gets paid 2/3ds what they're worth, and cannot ever dare to say No to anything. Not pretty. (2) It makes the student pay for what is a mutual benefit to the student, the employer, and society. (3) It creates a new credit vehicle, which in six months will be bundled, sliced & diced, packaged, and resold on Wall St., contributing further to excess credit derivative bubbles. Also: (4) it provides yet another insidious way in which American workers mortgage their souls and lifetimes to The Man. Better to work on making education free, as Khan and Coursera do; or getting the government or the employers to sponsor the trainings; or incent millionaires and foundations to compete in quality/quantity of sponsorships; or teach people to save and be self-reliant, so that they don't have to take out credit to learn a trade.

So concentrate on Kanban, but lose the new credit vehicle. What would this look like?

The book is set in 10-point sans-serif font, and is physically painful to read. Margins are 5/8"" at the top, and 1.5"" at the bottom of pages. The book title, and all chapter titles, are typeset vertically. A future version would profit by using 12-point serif type, same pagecount, and chewing up the space at the bottom.

For a respected founder of Teknowledge, Dr. Kaplan sadly serves best by pointing out what he is ignorant of. He makes a ""joke"" that he lives in a 10,000 sq-ft, three-storey, 7-bedroom custom-landscaped home with a 2,500 sq-ft 2BR guest house, 5 refrigerators, that can accommodate 150 guests and 200 guests for parties respectively, but ha ha he's not one of those rich jerks like the ""top 1%"". They should give their money away to help create jobs and help people become less poor, the greedy bastards. Then he actually says he contributes his charity money to help his kids' ""private school capital campaign, instead of a local homeless shelter"".

Well, actually the top 1% homes start at 6,400 sq'. But more important is the ethics question that Dr. Kaplan brings up. Should people have free will over the possessions and capital they own and control? Or should what they earn be taken away from them by force, and redistributed to the poor?

'Cause we ALREADY have a social institution to take care of the latter, it's called The Government. I personally would like to see both taxes and charitable contributions be made voluntary, backed by strong marketing. If people feel called to donate to a cause, they should donate. But one of the reasons why The Rich do not spontaneously give all their money to poor people is because The Rich are each individuals just like you, me, and Dr. Kaplan--they feel like they've got legitimate expenses, concerns, and risks, and they do not feel called to donate. Dr. Kaplan may not be in the top 1%, but for certain he is in the top 2%. If even Dr. Kaplan, with his modest 350-guest capacity and his sub-$300K income, does not feel called to help the homeless, then why should anyone else?

It is therefore hypocritical to rag on billionaires because they do not spontaneously form more charities than they already do.

Dr. Kaplan then displays his ignorance of the difference between wealth on paper and cash flow, by insisting that billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates are not helping people's lives, but could and should rather take their billions and give them to help people for real. Like give them jobs, or something. Why, Bezos is worth $32B; the greedy bastard could EASILY use that to fund a $26B shortfall in California's budget.

Strange as it may seem, Bezos does not have $32B in cash lying around his home. Although Dr. Kaplan talks about Gucci bags, most of Mr. Bezos's wealth is tied up in stock certificates. That he got as receipts. From contributing more than $32B to the economy. By creating steady jobs for 150,000 people.

Oh.

You mean, good entrepreneurs actually CREATE wealth? And (the successful ones) create steady jobs for people? And the rich ones have ALREADY DONE SO, so you might think about being grateful to them, instead of calling them stingy greedy bastards who should not be able to sleep at night?

(Yes, Hillary, entrepreneurs actually create wealth, not the Fed. Not Modern Money. But that's another topic for another day.)

Reality Check: If Mr. Bezos actually DID sell even 10% of his stock to buy hospitals, say $4B, what would actually happen? This would send a strong market signal that JEFF BEZOS does not think Amazon is All That anymore, and has better things to do with his time and money than manage and own the jobs of 150,000 people. Amazon's stock price would plummet like a flying sheep down 20%, and Jeff would actually walk away with only $3.2B in cash. But: Amazon's market cap is $300B, much of that owned by institutional investors. At the cost of a $3.2B hospital, Dr. Kaplan's proposal would instantly wipe out 20% or $60B worth of value owned indirectly by retirees counting on that to fund their groceries.

Ooo. Didn't see that one coming.

Dr. Kaplan then rags on Mr. Bezos for creating even more jobs with Blue Origin (instead of, say, California schools). He rags on the top 5% for having the gall to support the economy strongly with around one-third of the total spending. And he rags on the ancient pharaohs for providing guaranteed socialized employment for 25,000 workers over 20 years building pyramids & getting to eat meat, and causing a ""stable political and economic system for several thousand years"".
This might even make sense if his theme were the inefficiency of poorly-allocated endeavors. He could then comment on the ""Bridge To Nowhere"" problem of handing allocation of resources to someone else, like the Government, or a self-righteous entity that thinks it knows how to spend Other People's Money, which almost always ends in tears. For systemic (moral hazard) reasons. But no, his theme is the problems caused by insufficient viable jobs being around, as a result of technological expansion. So his examples undermine his thesis.

My problem with most people who go on about income inequality is that they seem totally unfamiliar with Zipf's law, or even the Pareto Principal. They seem to think it surprising that a few people make billions of dollars more than most people. They also seem to think this natural outcome is a problem. This is only a problem when people concentrate on perceived unfairness of relative inequality, and do not look at absolute poverty levels.

Say, for instance, you have a country, perhaps like Japan, where just about everybody makes $50,000/yr. In absolute poverty terms, everyone is well fed and quite happy. Now, say, you add a handful of 1% billionaires to the mix; people who create hundreds of thousands of more jobs, spend millions of dollars more money in the economy, keep a few more billions collectively in the bank so that banks are more solvent and can loan more, and pay millions in additional taxes.

According to the inequality metric, all the previous people have been made terribly unhappy indeed. The 1% are way so much richer than they are, that they are knawing their insides out in envy and agony.

According to any reasonable objective metric, though, not only are all the $50K people at least as well off as before, they are even better, because the money velocity of the overall economy has increased. Much better to measure absolute poverty rather than rail at Pareto inequality.

All this hogwash is a smoke-screen to the actual immanent problem, which needs a serious answer.

Dr. Kaplan amazingly conflates robot minds, which he calls ""synthetic intellects"", with robot bodies, which he calls ""forged laborers"". Excluding military robots, the first revolution hits hard in 2017-2018, while the second doesn't start to make a serious dent until 2022-2028. These require separate discussions and solutions.

All in all, a provocative first effort for a deadly serious topic; but the presentation gets in the way too much, and I feel the book raises more questions than it answers.",14

I was excited to read a book about technological breakthroughs and how to position myself and my children for the future. Instead I get pages and pages about income inequality and how the rich make too much. Give me a break! It is super disappointing that I wasted money on a tired left wing rant about the good old days when incomes were more equal.
Most of the book consists of his ideas for income redistribution from those who work to those who don't. whenever there is change on the horizon the left always sees it as a chance for more government intrusion and ultimately oppression.

Jeffry Herman,1.0 out of 5 stars,Humans Need Not Apply: A Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,"Beware, a lecture on liberalism hiding out as a book on technological advancement!","The author had some interesting points right up to page 109 where he goes into an inequality diatribe with no basis in the advancement of technology. He seems to be more than a bit jealous of Jeff Bezos, and wanted him to pay down California's deficit.
The two previous chapters go into minutia that has little bearing on the over all advancement of technology and how it will effect humanity.
Who cares how Amazon prices their stuff, I care about how they will decimate brick and mortar and effect employment.

At page 131 I had had enough and stopped to give a progress report. I will continue to the finish this book in the hope for a better second half, but previous to page 131, this book was hiding out as an education on technology and how it effects the economy, but ends up a lecture on liberalism.

With the advancement of technology, we will have to find ways to get money to those displaced, so that consumers have money to spend, but so far this is the same old liberal philosophy of confiscating other peoples money!",8

We undoubtedly need some renegotiation of the language and hierarchy between garden-variety intelligence and emotional intelligence. Old smart really is the new dumb.

Dimitri Darras,4.0 out of 5 stars,Humility Is the New Smart: Rethinking Human Excellence in the Smart Machine Age,Subject on-target - look forward to more,"I'm glad the authors tackled this subject which seems to be trending in current business and organizational literature. If feel that they entered risky, unsafe territory which is refreshing for business writing. In many ways the thesis (compassion, listening, and humility) seems obvious but it isn't. Pay needs to be tethered to NOT being an a-hole because being one leads to losses for everyone in the end. Take a look around at the current surreal economy and global leadership - does it look like Boomer-style management is working well? By objective measures (equities) yes, others (political, socioeconomic) no. I disagree with the authors on AI and am an optimist on this front. Machines will never replace most people's jobs despite being being anthropomorphized and demonized by popular culture. There are some areas in which machines will never excel at - and I don't mean human emotion - basic connections that a primate could master. My thinking is based on two decades of working-hands on with them. Show me a sentient system and I'll eat my hat. After all, AI is designed by humans and thus intrinsically flawed.

Thumbs up for guaranteed minimum wage if that's what it takes for people to live with dignity. However, I refuse to believe that workers replaced by automation can't learn something new to do (Amazon Mechanical Turk, for instance. civic volunteering, town and county beautification, counseling, EMT services, kid's entertainment - you get the idea).

The section on mindfulness lost me because I cannot ever seem to attain it and end up with counter-productive results even. While it's intrinsically sound, the groundswell around it is just plain annoying. Try just being decent or getting something concrete done well. Maybe that's my definition of mindfulness.

I felt that the section on Bridgewater was not critical enough - many journalists have suggested that their techniques are bizarre and distressing (skinny dipping anyone? NYT article- read it). Despite being effective and fascinating to the public, something doesn't ring quiet right about their operation, as lucrative as it is. If the reports about their metrics-obsessed culture are true, it conjures up a laughable image. Better to be broke under a yoke. For full disclosure, I applied for an IT job there during the recession - professional and thoughtful rejection letter ;) - so I need to have a 360-degree perspective too.

I think a modified version of the Bridgewater model (the so-called ""principals"") could lead to a more honest workplace - a rarity in today's day-and-age. If you read the Principals, there is truth and sincerity in the anecdotes and psychological insights. In closing, I'm doubtful that a set of exercises and case studies will give all employees critical thinking skills and being able to clearly articulate in art or writing one's purpose in life. On the other hand, I waited months for this book and the authors volunteered personal stories and ideas that got my brain thinking creatively, even if I didn't agree with entirely agree with them. Good books spark discussion and dissent not blind adherence.",1

This book is a 'must read'. Not only does it give a great summary on how the stock market became computerized (as other reviewers mention), but it really helped me understand how the modern market came to be.

My goal in reading the book was to up my trading game, and while the book gives few trading ideas, it does a great job explaining how 'big money' and the HFTs game (cheat? trade?) the market. Understanding this alone really helps me understand price action at a whole new level.

Dennis Noren,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,Excellent Assessment of what HFT has become.,"Although I am no expert in the stock market and the Wall Street environment, I have read quite a bit, and appreciate clear and fair assessments of what has happened and is happening. Scott Patterson seems to have provided an excellent, detailed description of how high frequency trading has developed. He mentions its positive aspects, and how it has also morphed into directions that hurt everyone except the narrow group of people who rig the system. Though there are some aspects that are difficult for the layman to follow, he has mapped out the major players and developments in a way for most everyone to understand. In particular, he describes:
- how some HFTs rig systems to get to the front of the line ahead of other traders,
- how prices get systematically manipulated, often crossing over boundaries of legality,
- how this system has produced a very risky situation for the entire securities and financial markets.

His descriptions of the mathematical and software mechanisms of HFT and adjacent transactions are not very sophisticated, but that does not take much away from a fascinating and powerful portrayal of the downward ethical spiral on Wall Street. We need to wake up as a nation (and world, as much of this is mimicked in countries other than the U.S.A.), and change the system towards a fairer and more stable structure.",2
Ian K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,An excellent book on the evolution of the electronic trading networks and high frequency trading,"High frequency trading has been in the financial press a fair amount in the last few years. There was the May 6, 2010 ""flash crash"" and the demise of Knight Capital as a result of a software error (were Knight lost $440 million in 40 minutes). Scott Patterson's excellent book Dark Pools provides a very engaging background on the evolution of the computer trading networks and the risk of HFT.

Even for someone with a background in finance, Dark Pools is a fascinating account. Scott Patterson manages to paint interesting portraits of the early pioneers of computer network trading (the so called SOES bandits) and the evolution of the trading networks. There's a very interesting portrait of Josh Levine, who wrote the software for the Island trading network. I have a book of essays by Haim Bodek on HFT. However, I didn't know his history in HFT until I read about it in Dark Pools.

I was also impressed that Patterson got people at Renaissance Technology to talk to him at all, although he doesn't have a much better picture of how Renaissance trades than anyone else.

The only fault that I can find with Dark Pools is that Scott Patterson does not understand software. He has an annoying habit of referring to any complex trading software as Artificial Intelligence (AI) software. Back in the 1960s AI got a bad reputation so very few people refer to complex decision making algorithms as AI. And in many cases the software that Patterson refers to would not be classified as under the old definition AI (although some of the learning algorithms might be).

But software is not the strong point of this book: computer trading networks are and Patterson does a good job describing these and how HFT evolved.",4
Dan Leithauser,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,Read after Flash Boys,"I read Michael Lewis's Flash Boys first. Flash Boys was one of the few non-fiction books that read like a fictional techno action story. Which is probably part of the reason it has received so much attention. Flash Boys left me wanting more...more details about how high frequency trading came about, the people who made it happen, and the motivations behind it all. That is exactly what Dark Pools delivers. The who, what, and why of HFT.

The ""who"" are highly intelligent people, technologists, programmers, physicists, statisticians... and less of the greed driven financiers that you might expect.... although there are plenty mixed in, The ""what"" is algorithms, computer programs, proximity to trading centers, and information churning through these programs discerning market moves in pico-seconds. The why -- especially at the beginning is less about making money and more about young technologists wanting to snub the establishment of Wall Street, open up markets for everyone, and making the whole process more efficient by essentially removing persons from the transaction.

Of course, all of this leads up to the last couple of years where the SEC is a slow moving entity imposing regulations that seem quaint compared to the speed at which the HF traders adapt and evolve. It is pitting a human against a computer in an algo war that is already rigged for the computer to triumph. Or maybe like the designer drug maker that is always one molecule ahead of the law that keeps the new drug from being illegal.

Dark Pools was a great read and an excellent book to read after Flash Boys!",2
M. LaPlante,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,Fascinating look into money gone mad,"By the end of the twentieth century corruption was widespread among the ranks of Wall Street stock brokers, but there was a powerful force of change on the horizon: technology. In Dark Pools, author Scott Patterson shares the story of how computers would come to upend the old guard of the stock exchanges and transform the markets in fantastic, and often unpredictable, ways.

Wall Street: The place where our 401ks and pension funds go, which we should all probably understand better than we actually do. Despite what could be called, at best, amateur interests in the world of trading, I couldn't put this book down. While by no means a deep technical work, Dark Pools still proved highly educational, offering a lot of insight into the inner workings of today's stock market. Fortunately, Patterson presents the material in a way that's eminently accessible, even for those without a Wall Street Journal subscription. Discovering not just how the market is, but how it came into its current form, was eye opening.

Dark Pools isn't just about the markets, however. It's also a testament to the raw power of computing and its ability to change the way we work in just a few years time. I expected the book to cover some hyper-modern trends like high frequency trading. What I didn't anticipate was a beautiful and inspirational story about a few gifted individuals employing computers to revolutionize the world of finance. As it turns out, one 20-something young man working out of a tiny office near Wall Street actually built large portions of the high tech stock market we see around us today. Ever the idealist, he sought to beat the hordes of greedy and self-serving market makers at their own game, using little more than a closet full of computers and his brain. And in many ways, he succeeded. But the story doesn't end there; this new technology would eventually take on a life of its own, growing and evolving at fantastic pace. Millions and billions would be made and lost in seconds. And it's still going on, all around us. Some say it's out of control.

I thoroughly recommend Dark Pools to anyone with even a passing interest in the stock market or the development of technology. It's an eye-opener on the state of our national finances on one hand, and a testament to the power of man and machine on the other.",1
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,"Great follow up to ""The Quants"", precursor to Michael Lewis' ""Flash Boys"".","I recently read, and thoroughly enjoyed, Scott Patterson's ""The Quants"". He picks up the same trends and storyline in ""Dark Pools"" with a well written, easily comprehended walk through the birth of electronic trading and to it's eventual evolution into the Wall Street villain du jour: the HFT outfits now so eviscerated in Michael Lewis' ""Flash Boys"". Patterson expertly weaves the narrative of david (the early electronic trading outfits) taking on golliath (the exchanges and the entrenched ""market maker"" hierarchy) and winning. There was corruption for sure, but the main architects of this revolution we're really heroic, or at least altruistic in their motivation. Patterson then takes us past a tipping point where the revolution is hijacked, the original pioneers becoming disillusioned, and the current HFT villains emerge (firmly, deeply in bed with the exchanges - a fact that needs to be understood by anyone looking for reform).

I have not yet read ""Flash Boys"" but I'm not certain why Patterson's excellent ""Dark Pools"" is not featured more prominently in the discussion. Perhaps the more nuanced story Patterson presents does not make for the easy headline?

I would strongly recommend this for anyone interested in the personalities and and inner workings of the ""plumbing"" of the Financial Markets. This should be a must-read preamble to anyone jumping on the ""Flash Boys"" bandwagon.",1
Carl from Chicago,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,An excellent history of electronic trading,"This book is an excellent history of electronic trading. It covers the early days and how innovation came from outside the exchanges and were actively fought by the clubby traders. In particular it focuses on NASDAQ and NYSE.

Some may find fault in that there aren't solutions posted but that is actually wise because this is a super-complicated set of inter-twined issues (before you even get to the issue of dark pools, below) and it is excellent to just have someone attempt to summarize the situation to date.

One minor nit is that the title is slightly misleading because it really isn't about ""dark pools"" at all - those are off-exchange pools of liquidity with selected firms only. The author obviously knows this since he is an expert on the overall market structure.",4

This book is a real eye opener, even more so than Flash Boys. I read it twice in a few days. It's all about traders making money off our money--including our retirement funds and other investments. The possibility of another flash crash of the markets at the global level is clearly a real systemic vulnerability. This kind of trading is ultimately driven by greed, by creating clever ways of gaming the market via computerized trading to make money off the rest of us.

As Josh Levine, the original creator of a fair electronic trading system that he hoped would improve the rigged system with human traders, was quoted as saying: If all this time, money, brilliant minds, and energy devoted to gaming the markets were put towards a good cause, such as finding a cure for cancer, we'd be a lot better off.

Where the author goes wrong is an indignant and sensationalistic attitude towards high frequency trading. There are abuses that need to be called out and corrected, no doubt about it. But needed perspective is lacking - things are vastly better now than in the bad old days. Then, you had to call a broker, pay $100 per trade, perhaps suffer bad advice along with it, versus around $10 a trade today.

I am sure this book ruffles some features to put it mildly; however, these are feathers that need to be ruffled. While I am far from a financial market expert, it is easy to see how greed is driving the exploitation of new market rules (namely Reg NMS) through HFT techniques that milk rebate fees and front run the investors they should be representing.

kevincastner,4.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,An Exciting Textbook,"After reading all the way thru this book, I can't really say I know what the author was trying to accomplish......he leaves us at a point in time without telling what he thinks, how he feels. Which bleeds some of the emotional underpinnings out of the stories. Is the book a clarion call to fairer markets? I guess that is the main point, but at some late part of the book the focus shifted from HFT to AI, and that central message got muddled. This book has a lot of information, perhaps too much. I feel it is strongest when the author tells a story with a human interest angle (though some of the 'protagonists' seem pretty inhuman). A few times too much detail fogged things up. If someone wants an in-depth history lesson on this subject I recommend Dark Pools unreservedly. Lastly, to read a chronicle of so many incredibly intelligent individuals doing nothing except try to make money from other people's money is just fundamentally depressing. To read this book is to understand that Finance has become a magnet for many of our best and brightest, and begs the question what does it say about our society that we provide more incentive in this arena that produces very little of value for us, humanity, instead of fields like science, medicine and education?",2
Fred Fandango,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,"No Liars Poker, But Still a Great Read","Scott Patterson isn't Michael Lewis. Still, he manages to hold one's attention while providing a selective history and a basic lesson in the mechanics of stock trading circa 2012. The story is choppy -- Patterson had only a limited number of sources and he pieced together much from publicly available information. Still, he provides an enlightening lesson on the dramatic changes in the functioning of the equity markets over the past decade. Investors of course can't help but be aware that stock trading these days is different than in past decades. To place a stock trade one uses an electronic platform like TD Ameritrade instead of phoning a broker. What investors may not realize is that the fundamental structure of equity markets -- the market making system (market makers on the NYSE were called ""specialists"") has all but disappeared, having been replaced by high frequency traders (HFTs). These largely unregulated trading firms serve the function of market makers but they have no obligation to stick around when the going gets rough. Patterson explains how the system evolved. It had a haphazard evolution that nobody planned. Amazingly, it sort of works. Except when it doesn't (as in the flash crash or the Knight debacle). The system is still developing and over time it will get better. At the moment, it seems cobbled together and wobbly, a scary mess really. It is (surprise!) designed to benefit the people who built it and not investors. Most importantly, with no limits on speed (the SEC could have easily created a level playing field by imposing a latency of say 10 msec) those trading firms who have their computers closer to the exchange computers (""colocation"" is best) have an advantage. This is about as unfair as one can imagine. At the end of the day, there isn't any evidence that the current system serves investors any better than old system. Yes, spreads on average are lower, but increased volatility and difficulty executing larger size trades has probably caused trading costs to increase overall. Nobody knows how much profit HFT firms are extracting from the public markets, but the fact that they are spending hundreds of millions on technology suggests that it is considerable. When creative destruction occurs, some things become better and others don't. Clearly, the regulators have been asleep at the wheel while the cataclysmic changes in the stock market have occurred. Huge regulatory mistakes have been made because regulators have failed to be proactive and have jumped in only when thing got truly out of hand -- too little, too late. Patterson explains the basic details in the context of engaging stories about some of the architects and players of HFT. Okay, finance can be boring so Patterson does his best to spice things up it up with lots of action, that gets tedious after the umpty-umpth time (""hundreds of thousands of orders flying into the market each second through high-speed connections, fighting to be in front of all the others. Just as quickly, as stocks bobbed and weaved, . . ."" and "". . . trades fizzing through fiber-optic cables laced around the world"" it is time to to want to scream ""enough!"").

Another book that reveals what is really going on in today's financial markets.

Reconfirms to me that what passes for business news these days is like what pro wrestling is to sports. With the demise of employer provided retirements, the average person is woefully uninformed in how Wall Street really works. The wolfs are in charge of the hen house.

Makes me wonder if index funds are the way to go anymore, because they have to be rebalanced. When this happens the funds have to buy and sell large amounts equities making them vulnerable to HFT sharks lurking in search of the whales in the dark and lit pools. Because it is dark no one knows how much this is really costing pensioners and other investors.

Does anyone really think the Great Rescission could have happened without the complicity of the SEC and our legislators?

Perullo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,pretty entertaining,"I enjoyed this book primarily because I work in financial services close to many of the characters and systems described. Like most books that need to make a potentially-boring true story more exciting, it has a bit of the over-dramatization and micro-fabrication you would expect and forgive. It does a good job, however, of introducing someone to the history and complexity of much of modern financial infrastructure. What it lacks in many cases is a complete explanation for some cause and effect relations. Some conclusions intimated by the book rely on a final leap in the proof such as ""and we all know computers are bad"" or ""and we all know trading is legit if the market goes up but illicit if the market goes down"". An example is the connection between the flash crash and mom and pop 401k accounts (which would be near impossible to harm via an intraday move and correction when mom and pop couldn't move fast enough to be fooled into panicking).",1
Daniel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,better than the other HFT books,"This book does 2 things:
(1) goes through the historical events that led to our modern stock market and
(2) tries to explain what is going on in market microstructure.

The book does very well on (1) -- it's really an enjoyable book to read. But on (2) there's almost no information, no analytic discussion about microstructure, and some of the comparisons and conclusions are simply wrong. For example, the Patterson compares the immediate liquidity with the days of the past comparing the top of the book orders and noticing that today you have fewer orders at the top of the book. But this is misleading. In the past when the spread was at least 25 cents (due to regulation, ie, in increments on 1/8ths, but also in part of the gentleman's agreement between specialists to keep the spreads large) and now the spread is mostly 1 cent for most stocks. To compare apples to apples you need to sum up the liquidity on 25 levels in the current market, because basically these 25 levels would have been aggregated into 1 level in the past. Once you do this comparison, it's clear that the order book today has much more immediate liquidity.

In spite of the title, another thing that's missing in the book is a discussion of dark pools. Obviously, there's a much bigger problem with dark pools today than with the lit market, mainly because the dark pools can legally do prop trading (and they do) on the flow they see, but in the same time they are marketing a hidden market. This is simply wrong and should have been discussed.

The author points out that the market is unfair, in the sense knowledge of market micro-structure gives some players an advantage. But the market was never fair. For example, players with knowledge about a stock have an advantage, even if that knowledge is public. The same with micro-structure. The rules of the micro-structure are published. Anybody can read the order types for the exchanges and the information is public. In the past it wasn't the case (specialists had privileges) In today's market the differentiation is more about technical competence and less about specialists born with entitlements. Moreover, the transaction costs for investors are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than during the time of the specialists. (I've never seen a single study that claims otherwise) In other words, it'd be unfair to draw Kasparov in a chess tournament, but at least you start with the same pieces (which was not the case during the rule of the specialists)

The author also doesn't compare the state of the stock market with our other markets: futures (futures is much cleaner), FX (dirty business, where banks have a separate inter market with tighter spreads for themselves, plus the broken will do prop trades against you) and OTC contracts, say corporate bonds (huge 1% spreads, little liquidity, the bank will own you). In other words the stock market is the most fair, except maybe for futures (1 exchange, no fragmentation, no complicated rules, latency less of an issue), and way more fair than FX and OTC. The few big banks that own the OTC business have a lot to gain from HFT bashing, as they really don't want their business on a lit exchange.

I only give 5 stars because it's an enjoyable book to read and does a good job at (1). Patterson is an outsider, but he did a good job at (1) that it reads like a novel. There are a few competing books about HFT for the average reader and all of them are worse than Pattersen's book:

1. ""All About High-Frequency"" (Durbin) - written by an insider, does reveal a little about market microstructure, but a very introductory book. Readable by anybody.
2. ""Speed Traders"" (Perez) - a book which was quickly assembled as a series of interviews, and Mr Perez is using the book to make a name for himself as a consultant for HFT. (his name is constantly on PR wire and he organizes all sorts of events)
3. ""Broken Markets"" (Arnuk, Saluzzi) - full of factual lies, written by old school specialists that use smarts to trade, which are bitter for losing business with the modernization of the exchanges, and want the fat 25 cents spreads back.

For the technically inclined that want to learn about market microstructure, there are a few more quantitative book, but they are all dry and not much fun to read.",137

I found that Patterson gave me enough detail in the explanations of the trading techniques that I could understand (at least at a reasonable level) what was going on but didn't go so far as to overwhelm me. That was a very fine line…

I did read (in the news) bits and pieces of what was going on with the rise of electronic markets but never really pulled it all altogether.

Flash Boys by Michael Lewis. I was going to buy only Flash boys, but bought this book also on the high recommendations. If you are going to read one book on the subject of the impact of HFT, I suggest you pass this one, and read Flash Boys. I really found ""Dark Pools"" to be much less readable for two reasons. Firstly, his writing style is atrocious, it is full of hyperbole and a type of purple prose more suited to a cheap detective novel than something which requires close intelligent reading. Secondly, I don't trust his specifics, due to the fact that when he discusses things I understand intimately (server and network technology) he often gets things wrong (distributed computing is based on many redundant systems, not many redundant disks). so I wondered what else was inaccurate in areas I did not understand. I much preferred Flash Boys. However, if you are interested in the subject, and planning on reading many books on the topic, I would say that this book gives a broader history of the evolution of modern markets, introduces you to many key players and gives some useful explanations.

R. Farley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,Terrific Narrative History on the Rise of the Machines,"Dark Pools is an interesting anecdotal narrative about the rise of computerized trading, ECN's, and the evolution of the modern stock exchanges. Many news articles have focused on the so-called rise of the machines. However, the financial press coverage of algorithmic and high frequency trading strategies often lacks a contextual understanding of how the various elements interact together. Dark Pools goes even further than simply explaining these dynamics--by providing a history and understanding of the evolutionary forces at work, and in how these forces were unleashed, the stresses and opportunities are that much more understandable.

Scott Patterson has written an important history that will bring both the professional and personal investor up-to-speed on how this all came about. He does this through a sequence of stories about actual traders, programmers, quants, exchanges, and trading firms. The thread by which these all connect and intersect is both a fascinating story and a cautionary tale. Most valuable is that investors can now understand the developments of the last two decades with a much more complete understanding of what has been hidden in the plumbing while they went about their business as investors.",10

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,2.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,Too much hype; very little substance.,"This book, although entertaining and a ""page turner"" to a certain degree, does not give the reader any kind of insight into the technical or mathematical tools that were used to implement automated trading. It is one thing to interview the ""key players"" behind this automation and write interesting stories about them, but quite another to describe the trading strategies, algorithms, and artificial intelligence used in it. Putting together a book on the latter will require a high amount of preparation from the author, and the reader will have to have the same degree of such in order to appreciate it.

It is no doubt for proprietary reasons that these strategies are not revealed in the book, but one can still insist on some measure of discussion of them while still staying within legal constraints. Instead, most of the emphasis of the book is on personalities behind the drive toward automation, and readers will probably be hearing their names for the first time. The author makes every effort to dramatize their contributions, and in some cases build some kind of sinister context in which they worked. Anyone who has worked in the financial industry has been familiar with scandals and has had to make contact with individuals that are to a large degree highly eccentric and difficult to communicate with. But on the average things are fairly mundane in the everyday practice of finance, both in trading circles and in areas that emphasis financial analysis and modeling. To make this book interesting though the author feels the need to accent the eccentricities of what he thinks are the key players behind automated trading. Whether they really are or were is still very much an open question after finishing the book.

The use of artificial intelligence in finance is well known to those who follow the industry, but what is still really unknown is to what degree these techniques are responsible for the ""flash crash"" of 2010 and the ""financial crisis"" of 2008. The author presents no quantitative evidence for his assertions that they were, but instead is content with telling anecdotal stories and reporting snippets from headlines and politician's mouths in order to make his case. Readers will have to seek other books, research papers, and financial reports to gain a more realistic understanding of the effects of machine intelligence in financial trading. They will find out that trying to correlate events with innovations in technology is a highly nontrivial one, requiring huge amounts of time and data, and therefore not in the scope of the typical reader.",19

Clement Hovey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,Much more than Dark Pools,"This is a very entertaining book on some serious issues.

Although the title may suggest that the material involved will be hard to follow for those not familiar with the finance industry, that is not the case.

As with all good story tellers, Patterson is able to relay the message in a way anyone can understand. That is not to say it is dumbed down in the slightest. I did my undergrad in finance, as well as a MBA at T10 school, and still had my eyes opened by this book.

By inserting personal details on some of the bigger players involved and weaving them into recent historical events, the plot is one that is both easy to read and provides some educational insight as well.

While ""dark pools"" is the title, not much of the book is on this exact topic. And that is actually a positive in this case. The topic is one that should be discussed amongst the other things the book brings up ""high frequency trading, artificial intelligence, etc.

Overall, the book provides insight into topics universally entertaining and is one that will leave you thinking about the future of stocks markets everywhere.",8

Most of the book leans towards journalism, (though perhaps never actually reaching it). Yes, accuracy is not the author's main concern, but I believe the anecdotal style does bring value to readers who are traders.

This book is a great complement to ""Broken Markets"" by Sal Arnuk and Joseph Saluzzi, while on the other hand the VERY dry ""Electronic Exchanges"" by Groham Singh doesn't even have ""HFT"" or ""High Frequency Trading"" in the index.

PM,2.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,Very biased and not properly researched,"My rating is 2.5 stars.
The book offers a highly biased opinion about today's electronic markets. Almost every characteristic of the current market microstructure is extrapolated to suggest doom for the average investor. Examples of a few highly quantitative funds not being able to make money are used by the author to suggest that the market is obviously rigged, and that no one except a select few can make money. (It feels like the author is saying that if you have a math, physics or comp sc. PhD from a top university with some background in finance and are unable to make money in the stock market the only plausible explanation is that the market is rigged against you.)
The section about Josh Levine and the history of how today's markets came to be is very interesting but the rest of the book is a complete waste of time.",7
Mercenary Trader,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,Meet the New Market Makers (Same as the Old Market Makers),"'Dark Pools' is a fun, intelligent, beach weekend read.

Apart from the obvious Wall Street / HFT focus, the book struck me as a cross between War Games, The Matrix, and Terminator: Rise of the Machines. You immediately enter a world of high tech mayhem, with super-algos, blaster bots, and hunter-sniper cloaking devices duking it out at the speed of light.

Re, War Games parallels, you get an iconoclastic, vaguely teenage anti-hero - Josh Levine, the misift-hacker-genius creator of Island - who pursues an idealistic vision of ""making markets free,"" with no impure thoughts of capitalistic gain, until one day his mutated ECN creation all but comes alive and says: ""Good morning, Professor Falken. Do you want to play a game?""

Re, Matrix parallels, by the end of the book we have fast-forwarded from the humble beginnings of electronic trading to the near birth of AI (artificial intelligence)... the ""desert of the real"" (in this case the real being markets)... and the grand vision of supervillainesque networked undersea substructures, monitoring global data flows from strategic ocean points all around the globe.

Re, Terminator, in the final stretch I kept waiting for Patterson to write: ""As future tech historians will note, SkyNet showed signs of self-awareness on X-X date, 2012...""

It was all a bit much - but in a good way. As Keynes once said, ""Words ought to be a little wild, for they are the assault of thoughts on the unthinking."" This book will definitely get you thinking about the impact of high frequency trading on markets.

My two cents: At the end of the day, high frequency traders are the new market makers... the superfast replacements for the hand-signaling floor traders and post-sitting NYSE specialists of old. Yours truly predicted as much would happen in a review of ""The Predictors"" by Thomas Bass, titled ""The New Market Makers?"" circa 2005 (still available via my Amazon review page).

As I wrote nearly seven years ago:

""These guys occupy a very specific niche in the market ecosystem. Before the onslaught of computers, human floor traders provided vital liquidity to the markets (and got paid plenty well to do so). As physical exchanges lumber towards extinction, `smart' algorithms are filling the shoes of floor traders, extracting profits tick by tick with high volume, high frequency strategies. These automated players are thus becoming the new liquidity providers and market makers of the 21st century. Daytraders and scalpers may find themselves swept up in a technological arms race, but longer term traders and investors have little to fear... it's a different game.""

Such is why this review is titled, ""Meet the New Market Makers (Same as the Old Market Makers)"". In a lot of ways, despite all the technological advancement, the biggest things haven't changed.

Take the infamous ""Flash Crash"" of May 2010, for example. When you understand the role that high frequency traders play these days - in terms of facilitating the majority of volume and liquidity in markets - it makes sense to expect chaos when they all ""pull their bids"" at once.

From the perspective of a freak occurrence where a large portion of the HFT community ""backed away,"" exposing ridiculously far-off placeholder bids that were never meant to be hit, the market makers of the 21st century acted just like the market makers of the last century amidst the crash of 1987. They left a void at a point of severe dislocation, just as the old school guys did so long ago.

Perhaps now that GETCO - which stands for Global Electronic Trading Co, the most supervillain-like shop of them all - has assumed official market maker duties in many household names, such bid pulling will not be a future problem.

The question remains: Are the new guys worse than the old guys? I'm skeptical.

Anyone nostalgic for the old days of physical pits and human specialists may not remember the day-to-day reality of such a system.

As an international commodity broker in the late 1990s, I had the privilege of phoning into the pits on behalf of hedge and commercial clients, to yell at some guy named Vinny or Frankie or Sol - inevitably the brother-in-law or cousin of the Refco floor trader who executed our order - to try and get restitution on a criminally bad fill. This kind of thing happened far too often.

And as for being an NYSE specialist? Talk about a license to print money. There is a reason such jobs were handed down from one generation to the next. In many cases, the opportunities provided were the legal equivalent of stealing.

Not to mention the commissions - good lord, the commissions! - that retail and institutional clients alike were forced to pay in the old days. Add it all up, and I don't think the pennies and nickels hoovered up by the HFT shops, mitigated by the incredibly low-cost commissions available via technology today, amount to such a bad deal.

A bit of wildness that made me laugh out loud was the notion that computers are going to take over the markets one day, as in, putting directional investors and traders out of a job. Seriously? Puhleeze. These bots may be great at nano-scalping, playing for blips on a mass scale, but true directional market involvement is another matter entirely.

If you're truly worried about thinking machines eating your lunch in a multi-day or multi-week time frame, don't be. Marvin Minsky, a noted forefather in the Artificial Intelligence field - a very confident AI optimist 15 to 20 years ago - recently admitted the following:

""The bottom line is that we really haven't progressed too far toward a truly intelligent machine. We have collections of dumb specialists in small domains; the true majesty of general intelligence still awaits our attack.""

""Dumb specialists in small domains"" well describes the proliferation of tick-hungry algos. They are good at what they do in a very tight timeframe, but the inputs required to parse incalculable variables across extended time horizons are another matter entirely. As I wrote some time ago, the most powerful supercomputer on the planet is not smart enough to figure out the turbulence in a glass of water - and yet we expect it to crack the self-referential human feedback loop that is markets?

The book closes with a glimpse of the supposed future in ""Star,"" the self-learning, self-teaching virtual machine assigned to make investment decisions for a tiny hedge fund, Rebellion Research. To the extent that Star is supposed to be a threat to humans, color me skeptical. (Those who are just mediocre at their jobs - rather than very good - have much to feel threatened by, of course... but such has always been thus.)

Patterson makes brief allusion to computer-assisted chess, the powerful combination of hardware and wetware (software programs plus human guidance). For cream of the crop money managers, I think this is closer to the true way forward - using technology to enhance human capability, not replace it.

In terms of thinking games, the best metaphor / AI-intelligence test is perhaps not the fixed Western game, Chess, but the fluid Chinese game, Go, which contains far too many variables within the scope of possible movements for any computer, even Deep Blue, to brute-force calculate the optimal strategy path. (For this reason, no Go champion has ever fallen to a machine.)

At the end of the day, trading and investing strategies will continue to evolve. High frequency traders, and various forms of new technology, will continue to influence markets in unexpected and interesting ways.

But I believe the following words from ""Reminiscences of a Stock Operator,"" which were true in 1923, will remain just as true a century hence: ""There are men whose gait is far quicker than the mob's. They are bound to lead - no matter how much the mob changes.""",33

JoshK,3.0 out of 5 stars,Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market,Two Separate Books,"This is really two separate books in one. The first is a bit hyperbollic, silly, and scare mongering account of the dangers of high frequency trading. The second book is a fantastic and engaging account of the evolution on the US equity trading marketplace.

Just some examples of #1:
At one point the author claims that HFT has lead to the lack of liquidity in smaller cap stocks including the slowdown of IPOs.
He quotes a consultant saying that a financial instituion will loose billions because of a loop in HFT code.
The reader is repeatedly scared of a looming and undefined ""catastrophy"" becase of HFT.
The improvements in spreads and liquidity is relatively ignored. Just go back and look at some old TAQ data to see how bad the markets used to be.
The author tries to paint a picture of one large order in the marketplace that is getting ripped off by HFT. The reality is much more complex with many orders of all sizes and time frames working throughout the day.

But, despite the silliness above, this is the best account of the evolution of the US market that I have seen. I'm sure many of the people considering buying this book have looked at ITCH and OUCH specs. But in the book I leared that it was all one guy, the original Island developer who developed them. And he named them ITCH and OUCH just to poke fun at NASDAQ's naming conventions.

There are so many more, great, stories that most readers will still enjoy the book. Take the history and the personalities and ignore the analysis.",89

A factual this-can't-be-real-can-it novel. The read will go quickly. You will ask yourself how on earth could/can regulators in Washington DC allow themselves to get so hoodwinked, and fail to protect investors? You will see the connection between our HFT hostage-taking ""liquidity providers"" and the SOES bandits of the 1990s.

Scott is gifted as a story teller. He takes a wonky history filled with geeks and freaks, and weaves it into such an easy and informative read. I got the book yesterday and could not put it down.

This is a must read for any investor, but it should be required reading for any employee at FINRA, the SEC, and the CFTC.

I tried about 10 other books on Neural networks, and always got stuck after the first chapter.
This book, actually EXPLAINS stuff.
It explains the mathematics very nicely before it is used with Neural networks, and there are loads, and loads of worked examples.
As long as you go through the worked examples, you can learn the material.

The book refers a lot to Matlab, I dont think you need Matlab to understand the book, but will get more out of the book if you have Matlab.
I used Mathematica for symbolics, when studying the book, (I suppose I could have used Matlab instead,
but you will need some symbolic software)

A very excellent and readable book.
They also give it away for free on the internet, but I recommend getting the book, as saves hassle of printing stuff out, and you need a hard copy,
to write notes on.

A curious thing, an excellent textbook (in my opinion the best on the subject), and apparently they have a set of instructional videos to go
with it. Why don't they just post the instructional videos on youtube, then charge 100 bucks for the book. I would still consider the excellent value at that price. I think the goal of the book, is to prop up Matlab's position as number 1 piece of software for Neural networks.
But seriously, a book that helps you learn and study neural networks, and the ONLY book that I have come across so far, that seems to do a good job of explaining.
Good explanations, Many, many worked examples, well presented, a LINEAR learning curve.

This book is extremely well written. Being a PhD student in computer engineering, I have read many math books and advanced engineering books.

More diagrams, more examples, rewriting paragraphs to improve clarity, etc. This book tackles all of those issues perfectly!

Right now I am reading one of the other ""classic"" math texts and while I am already familiar with the topic, the reading is extremely difficult. Due to this, I recalled how easy it was to understand the neural network design text and wished my current author wrote more like them.

If you are interested in machine learning, in particular, neural networks, this is a superb book to get you started.

fitzalling,5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: What Everyone Needs to Know,"Artificial Intelligence probably isn't Skynet, but it probably will affect your life","This is a useful overview of the current state of artificial intelligence. The author has clearly been swimming in these waters during his academic studies and professional career. I came away with the sense that his thoughts and observations were based on close personal experience and careful analysis. If the area interests you, I think that you'll find that Dr. Kaplan is an experienced guide.

What are some of the major areas that the book examines? He examines the definition of artificial intelligence, considers its intellectual history and explores the frontiers of robotics, computer vision and speech recognition. As he looks at the philosophy of AI, he explains his position on whether computers can think, have free will, possess consciousness, and have feelings. He doesn't think they do and deems it unlikely that they will.

The author also examines the effect of AI on law, human labor (basically jobs) and social equity. These issues currently affect much of our political discourse. Since I think that much of our society fails to appreciate the economic and social effects of technology, the book addresses matters that, in my opinion, need more of society's attention. The book looks at the possible future impact of AI. The author believes that the future impact of AI will likely mirror that of other technological advances; in other words, that with time AI will be viewed as simply another tool to be employed for good or ill.

You should be aware that the book takes time examining philosophical issues such as can intelligence be defined or accurately measured (probably not in the author's view), what are free will and consciousness (difficult to define in humans and probably impossible to define in machines) and feelings (whether computers will ever have feelings is mostly a matter of a human's personal choice). Will artificially intelligent machines ever rule over us (probably not, but no one's 100% sure)? This reminded me of another book published by Oxford on Complexity which described emergent conditions such as one or a number of water molecules do not possess the condition that we call ""wetness,"" but a lot of water molecules in one place are commonly described as ""wet"". Maybe if we get enough of these machines connected and operated under a range of algorithms, then humans may discover that, as a large number of water molecules are ""wet,"" a large interconnection of computers suitably programmed may start to look ""intelligent,"" whatever we may mean by that.

Dr. Kaplan provides a broad and useful overview of artificial intelligence. If the topic interests you, I recommend it.",6

Kyle,1.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications,Outdated,"This is the first time I've actually taken the time to write out a review. I'm sure this book was awesome when it first came out, it is clear, concise and has a nice follow-along structure. However, it has become outdated and it is riddled with either old syntax and errors. I have gotten past most of that though. The worst part is probably that the files that are used in some of the examples are hosted on the authors blog and have been taken down. If he can't be bothered to continue hosting old files for people who may buy the book (or point us to somewhere to get them) we shouldn't be bothered to buy it.",123
Denny,3.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications,Good - If you know what you're getting,"Let me start with pointing out what this book does well:

- The book gives a good survey of common Machine Learning algorithms. It explains what kind of problems these algorithms are good for. That's perfect for someone who wants to get a quick overview and has no background in Machine Learning.
- The book is very easy to understand. The writing style is very casual. Even people without formal training in Computer Science should have no problem. The only thing that's required is basic programming knowledge, preferably in Python.
- Among all of the theoretical ML books out there it's refreshing to find a book that applies the algorithms to real-world problems.

Now the negative points. The following are not necessarily negatives for everyone, as it really depends on what you were looking for in this book. However, I was expecting a bit more, and was disappointed about the following:

- Half of the books is code. I just don't see the point in printing full listing of Python code. Why not give shorter pseudocode and make the Python code available on the website? The long code listings only obfuscate the ideas instead of demonstrating how to apply them. If you take away the code listings there are maybe 150 pages of ""real"" content left.
- The very casual and easy-to-understand style comes at a price. The book does not go into the mathematical details of any of the algorithms. I understand that this wasn't the books intention to begin with, but I would argue that some mathematical background is necessary in order to efficiently apply complex algorithms. If you want to apply the algorithms presented in the book to slightly different or more complex problems, or wish to understand the advantages/disadvantages of each of the algorithms you'll have to know the basic math behind them.
- The algorithms are very poorly implemented. Looking at some of the code makes me cringe. While the code in the book may work for ""Building a search engine"" for a few thousand pages, or optimizing problems with a handful of variables, it certainly won't work for more interesting problems that involve real-world data, which is orders of magnitude larger. And the real-world scale is where these algorithms actually become interesting. The code in this book will only work for small examples where efficiency play no role. I understand the author wanted to keep the code as simple as possible, but in my opinion a few notes about how algorithms can be made more efficient would have been necessary. I can see many people trying to apply these algorithms to their real-world data, and getting stuck because of the poor implementation.",13
albenali,1.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications,"Outdates, Code no longer works","I would not recommend anyone buying this book. The examples are outdated, based on sites that don't even exist anymore. The list of errata is huge (and doesn't even include all the errata I found).

Finally, the the author references old versions of python libraries that no longer 'work as advertised', or that have changed so radically that the example code will not even run - you'll be spending hours just figuring out how to update the code to be compatible with newer versions of the libraries referenced in the book. That in itself is a frustrating experience.

My advice is, get another book for Python or ML if that's what you're looking for and don't waste your time with this one.",18
Rhys Tague,5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications,A book for anyone wanting to tell a story,"There's a point every developer hits, that point where everything seems mundane, repetitive and not worth doing anymore. You might go on and try another language to spice up your life, but you then, again, realise same old, same old. You Grab something from the models, do some funky stuff in the business logic and then present. You know what to expect, your know how to do it.

This book is for those who realise programming, no matter what language, can do amazing things once you understand some simple concepts to tell a story through data. It gets you out of the mind set of, ""I have some data stored here, and I will present it here"". Instead, ""I have some data stored here, how do I show, create understanding, explore, wedge out, predict, recommend it here""

Most of the topics presented in this book are not new in any sense, however they are not old either. They're tried and proven methods for creating meaning from datasets. They will be used for decades to come because they work! There are other books on the topics presented, like I said they are not new, however the simplicity of Python provides a frictionless entry for anyone wanting to get up and running with out a bloated IDE or framework to make it happen.

Those who are thinking, ""well it's Python, and Python can't do X"", I say to you a language does not determine what can and can not do it is the developer. At the end of the day the capability of the developer determines what the language can and can't do. If it seriously can't do something then build an extension to the language! With this thinking you can port what is presented in this book to any language. Python was chosen for it's simple constructs and readability.

If you're ever going to by a book on this topic buy this. Not the kindle, but the hard copy. The kindle version I've found doesn't present well for the code sections.

Overall this book is a great reference and is also a great primer if wanting to go deeper. It will allow you to tackle your next project with a different mindset and allow your users to discover and learn new things about their online surroundings and themselves!",1
Aneesh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications,Good to pique your interest,"This is a good introductory book to pique your interest in machine learning as was my case. But reading it got a bit frustrating as the code samples seem to be out of sync with the text and I was left wondering whether I wasn't quite understanding it right. This has been my major gripe with the book as you spend a lot of time making sure that you are not wrong. The book does not have a lot of emphasis on explaining the theory and mostly aims at giving you formulae to get the job done. It might be because an explanation of the theory might be beyond the scope of this book, but it kind of leaves the reader with an incomplete feeling.

This book would serve well to generate an awareness of the techniques and algorithms, but one would have to go in search of more material in order to be able to truly understand the concepts and algorithms introduced.

If I knew of such a book I'd rather buy that than ""Collective Intelligence"".",7

I would say that if you are in any field that uses statistical analysis of experimental or research data, you would find something to use in this book. Someone new to the math may have problems, but the examples might still be enough to wrap your mind around the concepts and give you a good understanding of the usage.

Syd Logan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications,Putting Theory into Practice,"This book is probably best for those of you who have read the theory, but are not quite sure how to turn that theory into something useful. Or for those who simply hunger for a survey of how machine learning can be applied to the web, and need a non-mathematical introduction.

My area of strength happens to be neural networks (my MS thesis topic was in the subject), so I will focus on that. In a few pages of the book, the author describes how the most popular of all neural networks, backpropagation, can be used to map a set of search terms to a URL. One might do this, for example, to try and find the page best matching the search terms. Instead of doing what nearly all other authors will do, prove the math behind the backprop training algorithm, he instead mentions what it does, and goes on to present python code that implements the stated goal.

The upside of the approach is clear -- if you know the theory of neural networks, and are not sure how to apply it (or want to see an example of how it can be applied), then this book is great for that. His example of adaptively training a backprop net using only a subset of the nodes in the network was interesting, and I learned from it. Given all the reading I have done over the years on the subject, that was a bit of a surprise for me.

However, don't take this book as being the ""end all, be all"" for understanding neural networks and their applications. If you need that, you will want to augment this book with writings that cover some of the other network architectures (SOM, hopfield, etc) that are out there. The same goes for the other topics that it covers.

In the end, this book is a great introduction to what is available for those new to machine learning, and shows better than any other book how it applies to Web 2.0. Major strengths of this book are its broad coverage, and the practicality of its contents. It is a great book for those who are struggling with the theory, and/or those who need to see an example of how the theory can be applied in a concise, practical way.

To the author: I expect this book will get a second edition, as the premise behind the book is such a good one. If that happens, perhaps beef up the equations a bit in the appendix, and cite some references or a bibliography for those readers interested in some more in depth reading about the theory behind all these wonderful techniques. (The lack of a bibliography is why I gave it 4 stars out of 5, I really think that those who are new to the subject would benefit greatly from knowing what sits on your bookshelf.)",184
Alexey I. Smirnov,5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications,A visionary book that illuminates the Internet,"This is a visionary book because it predicts a lot of what will happen to the Internet soon. How do we process information in the Internet age? Instead of reading magazines and newspapers we use blogs as our source of news. This is because blogs offer much more customized news feed. In a typical newspaper, how much of its content is of interest to a reader? I guess half is a big value but typically it is less than that.

I start my working day with consuming two sweet drinks. One drink is a cup of coffee. Another is a virtual information soup made of 100 blogs. I glance over most of the stories quickly using Google Reader and select those that I am interested in. I might read them in greater detail later on during the day, in the evening, or on a weekend. I do not know which drink gives me more pleasure - the delicious cup of coffee or sweet virtual soup. I like the latter a lot because it is rich with media content - with bright images, cool videos, wow-type web pages.

However, I often discover news that I wish I found out earlier. In other words, there are so many news sources that reading them all or just looking at the headlines of major blogs will take too much time. We need targeted information delivery service.

This is the main idea of this book. In fact, it starts with explaining how to make recommendations given a set of preferences of a number of people and your own preferences. What are those cool things that you have not tried out yet but everybody else did? The example described in the book is applied to Delicious which does not offer recommendations yet.

I often try to decide what my interests are. The blogs that I am reading might answer this question if one builds groups of them. In fact, I have done this manually, but I found out that this categorization is not perfect. The book answers this question in Chapter 3.

After that the book deviates into a number of additional topics such as search, neural networks, discrete optimization. The author Toby Segaran has a great ability to explain difficult concepts using simple words and pictures. As most of the stuff was familiar to me I was wondering how easy a new concept seemed and how much time I spent originally understanding it.

After that the main melody of the book is there again - the next chapter explains how to filter documents, for example to decide if a particular news story is interesting to you or not. Then the book deviates again into decision trees and building price models and even matching people on a dating site. However, there comes our melody again - this time it explains how to extract trends from a lot of news sources, that is decide what people are discussing today. This feature is similar to Google News except that the user has no control of news sources.

I was surprised when I found out that Python is such a popular language in a scientific community. The book describes lots of libraries dealing with numerical data or displaying various charts. The book will serve as a great introduction to Python language even though there are lots of introductory books available. In fact, learning Python this way it easier and more enjoyable.

After reading the book I definitely want to try out the tricks explained there and improve my information soup. This book is my virtual cookbook.",4

M. Hyman,3.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications,"Good overviews, but too pythony","I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it does an excellent job of providing a high level overview of a large set of machine learning algorithms: Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, nearest neighbors, clustering, optimization, and genetic algorithms. The description of the algorithms are clear. On the downside, the book relies too much on Python syntax when it would be clearer to use formulae. For example, i would find a simple mathematical formula easier to read than math.sqrt(math.pow(x1-x2,2)+math.pow(y1-y2,2)). Sure, the end result is the same, but a formula would be a lot more generic and easier to think about.

I also found that the author's obsession with Python became a bit tiring, in that not only is the code written in Python (oh well), but all of the sample data is Python related, so it comes off as being religious.

The code in the book is ok. I would have preferred Java, and would have preferred a more verbose coding style, although part of that is a side effect of Python style. My bigger objection is that the book spends too much time on code that is unrelated to the core, and not enough time on the code related to the algorithms. For example, there are lots of discussions on how to parse a variety of third party data sources or APIs. That may or may not be useful, but it isn't germane to the core of the book. I would have preferred more focus on the algorithms, more discussion of the techniques, optimization concerns, alternatives, and examples. The API for reading data from Amazon Web Services, or social network services, etc could be relegated to an appendix or to an online set of examples.

Altogether, I enjoyed reading the book because of the speed with which it overviewed a broad set of techniques, but I would certainly pick up a more advanced book before starting to code anything real.",1
Leo Dirac,5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications,Accessible introduction to complex topics,"Segaran has done an excellent job of explaining complex algorithms and mathematical concepts with clear examples and code that is both easy to read and useful.

The examples give real-world grounding to abstract concepts like collaborative filtering and bayesian classification.

My favorite part is how he shows us code (gives it to us!) that goes out into the world, grabs masses of data and does interesting things with it. The use of a hierarchical clustering algorithm to dig into people's intrinsic desires in life as expressed in zebo is worth the price of the book alone. The graph that shows a strong connection between ""wife"", ""kids"", and ""home"" but a different connection between ""husband"", ""children"", and ""job"" is IMHO just fascinating.

Vladislav Skvortsov,2.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications,Not worth the money,"In short: this book isn't worth its price.

The major part of the volume of the book is code and corresponding explanations. If the reader is a decent programmer, he can actually figure it all out by himself given algorithms. Otherwise it makes more sense to get a book on data structures, or Python, or general algorithm construction and learn the basics there.

The algorithms/methods presented in this book are not really specific to ""collaborative intelligence"" (with a couple of exceptions). The author gives a brief overview of the techniques and then dives into great details on how to implement it. In reality unless you are working on a toy site, you don't really need that code, since it wouldn't scale or fit the production environment. You'll need the math model / algorithm to come up with reasonable implementation. However, it's exactly what the book is missing. Well, it gives *some* info on that, but you'll need to read a more comprehensive source if you intend to really implement it.

I was quite disappointed with the book. I guess it might be ok for a junior developer to get a feel of what that all is about. If you've ever come up with an algorithm by looking at a mathematical description of the approach, you don't need this book at all; you can write a similar one yourself.",15
Vince Petaccio,1.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning,NOT THE SAME BOOK,"I purchased the paperback version of this book, which has the title Machine Learning: An Artificial Intelligence Approach (Symbolic Computation).

Amazon lists this as the paperback version of the Machine Learning text by Mitchell.

However, the differences between the hardcover and the paperback are huge. The paperback was published in 1983. The Mitchell hardcover book was published fourteen years later in 1997. The authors on the paperback are labeled as ""Edited by Ryszard S. Michalski, Jaime G. Carbonell, and Tom M. Mitchell,"" while the hardcover lists the author as Tom Mitchell.

Critically, there are also significant differences in the contents. For example, chapter 8 in the hardcover version is titled Instance-based Learning. Chapter 8 in the paperback is titled Using Proofs and Refutations to Learn from Experience. Chapter 3 of the hardcover is called Decision Tree Learning. In the paperback, chapter 3 is called A Comparative Review of Selected Methods for Learning from Examples. This is not an issue of reordering; the paperback has totally different chapters. Use the Look Inside tool to see for yourself.

I suspect from the Symbolic Computation logo on the top of the cover, as well as from the lack of a true ""author,"" that the paperback edition is a collection of papers from the Symbolic Computation journal, and not a true textbook. The similar titles and Mitchell's name on both perhaps created confusion at Amazon.",1
emoKid,4.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning,"Great Overview Book, Spine cracks...","This book is really good for an introduction to all types of machine learning algorithms. It has good detail for most of the algorithms.

Some of the other reviewers say that it lacks depth. This is somewhat true. There are a few chapters that leave you wanting more, but overall I still think this is a good book.

I have several machine learning books, and most of them are more in depth, but lacking a broader overview of machine learning. So if you want an overview of different problem solving techniques, this is the book for you. It has enough theory to keep most people happy. If you want to know the core motivational aspect to the finest details, this book will be lacking in some areas. Other books may have more detail, but just know they won't cover as much of the overall subject.

This is always my go to book for trying to remember something. It's small, light, and enough to get me back on track. I have other books for more in depth reading, but they don't cover as much of the subject of machine learning as this one.",1

Sytelus,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine,A 10 year quest to understand Turing's paper ends here,"It was about 10 years ago when I first found Turing's original paper on Internet and thought it wouldn't be so hard to read and understand it (after all its ""mere"" computer science). Since then I've tried to digest it quite a few times on and off and never actually succeeded. Infect most of the time I got stuck on few nitty-gritty and just couldn't move forward. I have even bought/borrowed almost all books on the subject that falls in to ""popular science"" types. Needless to say, like many such books in same category, they just never go in to details and are practically useless for all practical purposes :).

So imagine my surprise when I see a book with title ""Annotated Turing"" and by none other than Charles Petzold who I've known as author who normally writes programming books. That surprise was only a start. I was simply shocked when I opened the book. It was as-if someone read your dream and made it a reality with absolute precision with zero compromises. If there is one such book like this for all of the milestone scientific papers, there would be a revolution in learning.

Let me put out some points what makes this book so perfect. Not just wishy-washy ""near perfect"", I'm saying SO PERFECT.
*First, the book contains explanation of every single line in Turing's paper. Literally. The format of the book is a line quoted from Turing's paper in bold and a paragraph or so of explanation and discussions for that line. Author's claim is that you can actually cut out all those lines and stitch them to recreate the Turing's paper in its entirety complete with page numbers! Now that's what I call precision.
*The book also includes all encompassing big picture overview, historical situation, importance, consequences and so on - nicely preparing reader for the journey.
*The book is so readable that I usually forget I'm reading a very technical book that goes in to very core of computer science. It's like nicest computer science professor reads you the paper line by line and answers all your questions, even those completely stupid ones.
*As I'd doubted many times, there are lots of errors in Turning original paper. This book amazingly points them out and corrects even the minor misprints. I'm just surprised how author even know so much ""insider"" details about those trivial misprints and errors.
*Turing's paper is full of obscure strange symbols (have you seen old gothic German font?) that are common in scientific literature today. Author explains all these symbols, what they mean, where they came from, what are the subtle differences and so on. Just amazing.
*Turing's paper have lot of omissions for explanations and steps which he probably left out as ""exercise for reader"" to keep his paper short. Sometime you might get stuck in those exercises and if you are not in academia you probably have no external help. This book deals with all these omissions and expands so beautifully on them that I can't imagine if there any better way to describe them.
*Apart from omissions, there are lot of shortcuts that Turing employs with rather flitting explanations or sometime absolutely none. This book covers you 100% for these shortcuts.
*A big part of understanding Turing's paper is actually mentally running his machine's step by step for all the examples he puts out. This book actually does this step-by-step run explanation making it so easier to read and understand quickly.

Anyway, some of you might think why one should even bother about reading this ancient computer science paper in first place? Answer is huge changes in the way we have started viewing universe recently. While Seth Lloyd's book ""Programming the Universe"" does good job of explaining this thinking, the summary is that the universe can be seen as computing machine rather than particle and energies in the realms of physics. There was even a paper that proposed that even a simple system consisting of billiard balls interacting in space is Turing complete! That means by setting billiards balls in some initial points in space and velocity can computer anything that your laptop can compute in theory. To understand advances in this area you have to fully understand what is Turing's machine and what it means to be Turing complete and how one can prove that a certain system is computationally Turing complete. That's where the paper comes in. Text books just don't do justice.",58
Singularity,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine,A fantastic commentary that will leave you bewildered,"I have a very firm belief that most books, documents, or textbooks on mathematics or the sciences are written by people without souls. This is certainly not one of those books.

From the very beginning the author provides very clear and informative summaries, illustrations, and examples so that you can digest one of the most important mathematics papers of the 20th century. He even throws in some subtle humor in the mix (it's easy to miss!). Each successive chapter should leave you with some sense of interest/amazement or thoughts of, ""why didn't I think of this?"" By the end you will understand how a computer works at its very core.

I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in computers or the foundations of mathematics. It will give deeper insights what computers and humans can, and will never be able to do.

One last note: there are certain points in the book (especially near the end) which can be difficult to parse. I would recommend anyone who does not understand first order logic to a great degree to not worry about understanding all the details, but accept the author's commentary and move on, especially if you're reading it for the first time. You should first try to understand the big picture before worrying about the nitty-gritty, and the book will be more enjoyable that way.",3
Trevor Burnham,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine,Rich and surprisingly accessible,"Don't let the title fool you: This isn't simply Alan Turing's groundbreaking paper ""On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"" with a handful of footnotes thrown in. While the paper is contained here in its entirety, there is, on average, about a paragraph of explanation for each line of Turing's prose. And before that, there is an extensive introduction to important concepts, starting with the distinctions between rational, irrational, algebraic, transcendental, and computable numbers--all explained in terms that any intelligent undergraduate should be able to understand. No mathematical background is assumed beyond algebra.

The Annotated Turing exceeds even the best undergraduate textbooks in explaining these concepts clearly yet concisely, and in doing so sets up the historical context that Turing worked in. When there is an interesting story to tell about Hilbert or Russell, he tells it. (Russell's life was, after all, sufficiently fascinating to be the subject of a recent comic book, Logicomix.) Those with a more extensive mathematical background will want to skim the early sections, but shouldn't skip them entirely.

What Douglas Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach did for Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem--a crucial discovery that was poorly understood outside of the domain of professional mathematicians--Petzold's book does for Turing's universal computer. If you have any interest whatsoever in the theory of computing, make this the first book you read.",23
paul kaiser,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine,very good book with some weaknesses,"what i really liked about the book was that it incorporated the original writings of turing and then provided examples and explanations. it also managed to weave in elements of turings life into the overall development of the book.

i have a very solid mathematical background, but primarily in real analysis, and not so much in foundations and logic. so i was very much appreciative having a highly educated tutor to help along the way. when someone has to struggle with the detail and intricacies of proofs and descriptions as appear in turing's work pointing out typos and missing parentheses is beneficial.

my only complaint regarding the book is that the indirect proofs are not identified at the very beginning of the proof. many of turing's results are achieved using indirect proof. they can be very confusing on the first reading because my first inclination is to accept what is written as consistent with the development so far. only later did it become clear that turing (and the author) was making an indirect argument.

after reading the book i have found it to be a very rewarding project. i wanted to really understand turing machines and their capabilities in much greater detail. i wanted to understand better the terminology regarding formal logical systems. i wanted to learn about alan turing through his work. the book was successful on all three levels for me.

if i understand the dates right that appear within the book, the paper which helped shape the foundations of computation was written by an undergraduate student who within a handful of years was helping design machines to decode german messages during world war ii. he was truly a genius whose life ended way too early. I personally think charles petzoid brought his story and his work to life.",2
J. Tauber,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine,The kind of book I wish I'd written,"Some books entertain, some inform; some confirm what you already knew, some make you change your mind about something. But then there are some books that just make you think ""wow! I wish I'd written that"".

For me, Charles Petzold's The Annotated Turing falls into that last category (as well, of course, as the informational category). It's a book worth reading not only for the topic itself but the way it's presented.

Petzold provides the necessary background before working through Turing's famous 1936 paper ""On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem"" with rich annotations at every stage, including biographical details.

If you are interested in the foundation of mathematics, computability, Turing's work, or even just ways of explaining mathematics in a historical context, I highly recommend this book.",89

It is very well done and well presented with quotes from the paper followed by explanations and historical notes. He also works out the details of various programs so that I could understand the types of instructions required to implement most procedures. I am really impressed that the mathematical community accepted the machine and its programs as proof, since it seems to be such a radical departure from standard practice. I am also impressed with Turing's creativity in conceiving of such a procedure. The world lost a great mind when Turing died.",2

Petzold does a perfect job of balancing the details with the pedagogy. In fact, he goes beyond that, at one point, for example, developing a full multiplier in the form of a state machine.

This is one of the best academic non-textbooks I've ever encountered.

Although at times you may start thinking of states as functions, even with the difference in mind, just how far Turing went to describing our programmatic world without ever having laid hands on a real computing machine is amazing...never mind the significant mathematical result.",2

I own two other books by him : 3D Programming for Windows (Pro - Developer) andProgramming Microsoft Windows with C# (Microsoft)and everywhere when it comes to math the author explains things in a way that even a newbie to the subject(say matrices) could understand it.

I was able to follow Petzold's explanations for why Turing takes the path he does throughout the book and overall feel that though I couldn't grasp some of the technicalities, I have an appreciation for the logical path Turing went down in envisioning his machine, and the role he played in the emergence of computers.",4

This is hands down the best introductory text I have come across on quantitative and computational methods for decision making and autonomous planning, with applications ranging from autonomous vehicle control to business decision making.

One reason this book is great is that it covers an incredible breadth of topics - everything from the foundations (decision making formalism, probabilistic modeling, sequential decision making basics) to rather advanced theory (POMDPs, newest advances in reinforcement learning) - without sacrificing the rigor and the depth of coverage. At the same time, the material is presented in a very logical order, which ensures that the new knowledge gradually builds on top of the theoretical foundation. The language of the book is plain, precise, concise and very easy to understand - even to people without advanced math background.

The quality of the math notation is in itself fascinating - the author has gone to great length to ensure all the math is very easy to read and comprehend. Finally, each chapter of the book provides an extensive literature review with up-to-date sources.

Sean,2.0 out of 5 stars,Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (Texts in Computer Science),"Lots of information, but ultimately useless","This book covers a lot of topics. It provides a brief explanation for each one, normally involving a lot of math, and occasionally an algorithm.

Unfortunately, because the descriptions are so short and technical, nothing is ever really explained at an intuitive enough level to really grasp the concept. This part isn't great, but that seems to be pretty standard for most technical textbooks, and if you're using it for a course you generally have a teacher to explain the concept up front and then you can use the book to elaborate on it. Right?

That's where this book fails. Not only does it not provide intuitive explanations, it doesn't cover any topic in enough depth to help with any written assignment or exam, and it fails completely to help with any programming assignments.

It's a nice book - it's very well written and illustrated, it's just not that helpful. The one good part about it is that it does cover a very wide range of topics. Rather than taking notes externally I just wrote them down in the book in each of the appropriate sections - at least this way I can reference it again and get the intuition and depth I need from it.",5
P. Abeles,4.0 out of 5 stars,Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (Texts in Computer Science),Good high level introdction to computer vision,"The book acts as a good high level introduction to various significant sub-fields inside of computer vision. It is also one of the more up to date books (as of 2012) discussing more recent advances. However, because it is so high level and attempts to cover so much information, it is not a good book to try to learn from alone and provides no practical information on implementation details or problems. The best way to use the book, in my opinion, is to skim through it and learn the keywords to search for and use the references as a starting point. If you are a self learner like myself, one of the more frustrating problems is when you search for the wrong keywords and can't find the material.

On the whole the writing quality is good in terms of clarity and insight. There are some spots that I felt that the book did little more than restate what was said by other authors of highly cited papers. While this is not always a bad thing, there were times that I disagreed with statements due to various practical considerations. Yes the original author was technically correct, but in the years since publication very few people actually do that since it's too computationally expensive or turned out to be less stable than advertised.

The layout and organization of the book is well done and contains many full color pictures. For a new text book it is also very reasonably priced. I suspect that it would be more expensive to print the book's PDF out in color rather than buying it! I bought the book instead of just skimming through the older drafts (available online from the author's website) primarily because I prefer printed books and to support the authors publication approach.

My rating is 4 stars based upon it being a high level introduction. As mentioned before, if you want a practical book that goes into how to implement all the techniques it discusses and issues that will arise, look elsewhere.",7
Brent Foust,5.0 out of 5 stars,Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (Texts in Computer Science),Top-Notch,"A great introduction to Computer Vision, a nice review of the history of Computer Vision, and an enlightening survey of current and ongoing research.

Richard Szeliski is a great teacher, at the top of his game, who gives motivation for the problems we may need to solve using Computer Vision.

The algorithms are not provided as software code, but as descriptions with plenty of mathematical equations, references to papers, and copious diagrams and color photos.

An enjoyable read, there is something for everyone interested in Computer Vision in this book. But although it is very broad, packing 700 textbook-sized pages with information, it does not always go very deep. And there is no source code. So you're on your own if you want to turn the discussed algorithms into working code. It's apparently intended to be used as a textbook, as there are questions at the end of each section. So reading each of the relevant papers and producing working software algorithms is left up to the reader.

There are lots of ideas with long list of references, but no practical implementation.
What I don't like about the book is

1.
Many paragraphs start with the phrase ""An alternative approach is ...""
(because the book tries to introduce many approaches)
and paragraphs end with the phrase ""read [reference] for more detail information""
(because the real information is NOT in the book, but in the referred website/book)
2.
There are equations, but there is no explanation about what each variable means.
This makes the equations completely useless.

Although the title claims ""algorithms and applications"",
the book provides algorithms in a very vague way, providing ONLY the direction of approach.
There is NO algorithm in this book!
To get the real algorithm, you must search for the paper that the book is referring to.

It cannot be used for neither learning nor reference.
NOT for learning, because the book itself has no material.
NOT for reference, because the book extensively uses online references.

David Cai,4.0 out of 5 stars,Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (Texts in Computer Science),Comprehensive textbook.,This is a comprehensive computer vision book and is definitely a good textbook. I used it to prepare my PhD qualifying exam and it went well. One negative comment is that the book focuses too much on the geometry stuff (nearly half of the book). However the computer vision community is developing as more machine-learning oriented.,4

A. M. Hernandez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Game AI By Example (Wordware Game Developers Library),A Stellar Book On All Accounts. A Must Have For AI Coders.,"Programming Game AI By Example by Mat Buckland is one of those books that comes highly recommended and was one I had been meaning to read for a long time. In fact, I originally purchased the paperback in 2006 and never got around to reading it. The interesting part is that the book is still very much relevant today and is not dated in the least. Well now maybe some of the engines and middleware have this stuff built in, but the fundamentals I think I still important to understand.

The book starts with a quick primer on math and physics. The basics are explained, like Cartesian coordinates, trigonometry, vectors, coordinate spaces, and some physics. Like most people reading a book of this level, the beginning was a light refresher. However, I’m a big stickler for reading books from cover to cover with no skipping around, so I did not mind a short recap. Next Buckland gets into state-driven design and demonstrates a simple command-line app using the concepts. I found this approach successful, and it was able to show the concepts without complex 2D or 3D math getting in the way.

He followed up with autonomous moving agents, mostly based on steering behaviors. I was already somewhat familiar with steering behaviors, but I found the author’s description and code to be clear and concise and explained the concept better than I’ve seen before. He then applies the previous topics to a simple soccer game. This was a great next step, and really compiled the knowledge being taught into something concrete. In the next chapter, the author went into graphs; what they are, how to use them, and some popular algorithms link Dijkstra and A*. I always wanted to know what A* was, and this book explains it fairly well.

Buckland then devotes a section to cover scripting languages and why they are useful. In this case, he chose Lua (not a bad choice) and explains some basics about the language, how to interface it with C++, and creates a simple finite state machine. This chapter is helpful even if you’re not coding AI and just need a scripting language for your game or engine (provided you like Lua). In fact, a lot of the concepts in this book are generic enough that they can be applied to multiple fields of interest for game developers.

Next, the author creates a simple overhead game framework used in the subsequent examples. Using this framework he then shows practical path planning, goal driven agent behavior, and finishes up with fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is another one of those buzzwords that always intrigued me but I never really understood. Buckland concludes with a quite excellent explanation of the concept.

Overall I found this book to be stellar on all accounts. I feel that any game developer could gain insight from this text, even if they aren’t primarily working with AI programming. The scripting coverage could be used in many games, and the algorithms covered are generic enough to apply to different disciplines. While this is the first book I’ve read on AI, I really can’t imagine a better introduction. Highly recommended.",5
Ivan Bohannon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Game AI By Example (Wordware Game Developers Library),"Great book, bad kindle translation","I purchased this book after reading the other reviews, and I was not disappointed.

It has GREAT content. Now the annoying part.

Obviously a robot without a spell checker OCR'd the book and make a kindle version, and then the author or amazon never proofed it. Every single page has words with numbers in place of letters and/or funky random spaces in the middle of words, words are even broken across line breaks.

Also NO browsable table of contents, chapters, or organization of any kind, so you would probably be better of with the paper edition if you are going to be referring back to the book.",15
Justin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Game AI By Example (Wordware Game Developers Library),Perfect AI Entry Level Book,"One Line Synopsis - This book is a must for anyone interested in the topic of AI in games, and it is full of examples that really drive home the lessons being taught.

With all the college courses and graduate studies devoted to the field of artificial intelligence, this book could have easily drowned itself it excessive theory. Thankfully, this did not happen. The author is truly able to give concrete examples and demonstrate the applicable methodologies. Not only do the examples given in the text convey the lessons in AI so clearly, they could easily be employed in your own projects.

I have given myself plenty of time not only to read the book, but generate my own AI code inspired from the book. It really is the perfect blend of theory, practice, and examples. If you are looking for an entry level AI book that will also deliver you into the intermediate stages of AI programming, this is the book you have been looking for.

I would highly recommend anyone who purchases the book to check out the source code that can be found on the companion website. It not only offers the source code from the book, but also the standalone executables that run the programs discussed. As AI behavior is such a dynamic phenomenon, it really lends itself to view the examples in motion alongside the text. That's why these programs are so helpful. Additionally, one can tell a lot of care was put into constructing these programs to really demonstrate the main point of each topic.

As an aside, chapter 2 of this book is an exceptional chapter for those interested in game engine design. It primarily deals with state-driven design and finite state machines, but also discusses game entities and their management along with message handling. While the topics in this chapter deal with AI behavior, their applications go far beyond AI and could easily be applied to many other features of games and software.",1
Eli,5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Game AI By Example (Wordware Game Developers Library),Even 10 years later; still one of the best treatments of Game AI,"Matthew Buckland's book was the second book on Game AI I had read (The first being Behavioral Mathematics). After reading it, I would say that that it is a major complement to his other book ""AI Techniques for Game Programming"". So anybody who thinks this book may simply be a rehash of the AI Techniques book is mistaken. This book will teach you about the basics of Game Programming and the mechanics that go into creating a Game AI Engine. I would recommend it as a great place to start learning about concepts in Game AI. I would also highly recommend reading ""3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development"" before reading this book though. Even though it's a graphics book, it's treatment on the dot product and other linear algebra concepts really helped me grasp the concepts presented in Buckland's book.",1
Lajean Keller,4.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Game AI By Example (Wordware Game Developers Library),Ongoing Review - Math Portion of the Book,"I am in the process of reading this jewel and have just finished the math portion of the book. There are some ""mathematical"" term errors that only a mathematician would catch (usage of the terms function vs. formula, and right triangle vs. right angle triangle comes to mind), and certainly do not deter from his presentation of the necessary subjects. He envokes the great memory mneumonic SohCahToa for trigonometry functions, but fails to spell out what that mneumonic represents (Sin is Opposite over Hypotenuse, Cos is Adjacent over Hypotenuse, and Tan is Opposite over Adjacent in a right triangle). The required vector analysis mathematics portion could have been a cleaner and more precise presentation, but covers all the key points. His examples along with graphs throughout this chapter do a good job of illustratating the mathematical concepts he feels are important to programming game AI.

Because I taught university level mathematics for years, the math portion was rather straight forward for me (other than the misuse of a few mathematical terms/definitions). I would have preferred to give the book 4.5 stars, but that was not an option. If the author covers the material beyond this first chapter as well as he has in the math chapter, then this should be a 'must buy' for anyone interested in the subject, and am very pleased with the purchased of this book.",1
Petr,5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Game AI By Example (Wordware Game Developers Library),Java examples,"This is rally great book. I agree with all positive review posted before, so I am not going to repeat them.

But there a few drawback.

1) There is not explain all peaces of the C++ code. It is clearly explained all about the AI, but many help objects ( i.e. transformation matrix for rotation) are not mentioned in the book and you find them only in the source code.

2) There are C++ source only for Visual Studio 06 and 08. I have big problems to recompile this projects in VS10 (at the end I managed it, but It takes me a lot of time). And of course, If you prefer Linux, you have a problem ...

Matthew Sickle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Game AI By Example (Wordware Game Developers Library),Fantastic book,"First, to give context: I am about 5 months along learning C++ for the creation of games. I am ok with the basics of the language and starting to learn the more advanced things.

This book was perfect for me. It has a math primer in the first chapter, which is very nice. It then gets right into the meat for a number of AI topics. It is more advanced than the learning books I have been using, but the source code provided completes the picture.

In short, it is a fantastic jumping off point to get into exactly the topics described. There's plenty more to learn after this book, but there's months of study right here if you want to dive deep into each of the chapters here as well. And if you just want to grab the technique and go, you should be able to do just that as well.

In short, if you made it to the point you are reading reviews for this book, I recommend to go ahead and take the plunge. It's not only excellent but at this price I would say it is a great value for the what you are getting.",1

This is a must have for anyone seriously wanting to understand game AI or even AI in general. I loved the read, and this coming from a person that hates to read books. Do yourself a favor, put it in your cart and buy it!",1

I also like that the extra material for the book that is usually included as a CD in other books can be found online for download instead, so you don't have to worry if you're missing something when buying the book.

Some of things I've learned in the book include agent movement behavior, using finite state machines, and message handling for state changes. A good understanding of C++ or some object oriented language is a must. Otherwise, the author uses easy to understand language and relates the subject very well.",1

The author speaks with the authoritative tone of someone who knows what they are talking about, yet he does not waste time trying to impress the reader with is brilliance. The chapter on math and physics gives only what is necessary, not more. The remainder of the text is filled with examples that actually make sense, a rarity in books of this sort. Furthermore, the C++ is clear and well annotated, making this a good text for C++ students as well as game programmers.
I highly recommend this book.",3

And don't get me wrong. These technique doesn't require much simplification and imagination as some graphic effect does. They're actually based on mathmatical and intuitive way.

A must have for every game programmer.",2
the1dabread,3.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Game AI By Example (Wordware Game Developers Library),Wish i could spend more time on it...,"Likes:
- How the author only deals with AI game programming and doesn't put in a lot of fluff
- The broad range of topics the book covers
- The use of actual 2D examples and an actual game ""Raven""

Dislikes:
- Use of ""helper"" files that have no explanation in the book (some are explained in previous chapters but the author should have included an appendix to list and explain all the files in the common directory)
- The code explanation is shallow when you consider the fact that the author neglects to tell you about the, many and crucial, other files that are needed to run the program.
- The actual code that can be downloaded from the web site needs a lot of tweaking before it even works (you should just be able to unzip it and run it).
- Chapter 3 and how the author only includes the source code for a final all encompassing program instead of smaller easier to understand projects.
- If you don't know Win32GDI then learn because the book uses it extensively to output to the screen, and that can interfere with understanding the actual meat of the program.

Summary:
If you are going to buy this book make sure you have a lot of time on your hands to look through the source code, tweak it, and pull it apart. The book itself just doesn't give enough explanation to allow a person to create their own version of the concepts without digging through the source code. Overall I would recommend the book to people with an intermediate knowledge of C++ and have very good 2D math skills. This book is a fine overview of major topics in game AI but is sorely lacking (add another 100 pgs of quality explanation on topics). It would probably be necessary to buy other books that are more specific in their focus.",22
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Game AI By Example (Wordware Game Developers Library),Really good book but...,"This book is really good for learning AI as reviewed in other guys' comment. However, this book does not deal with neural networks. When I first ordered this book, I expected some more neural nets recipes than his other book 'cause this book was published later than that one.

Riccardo Audano,4.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Game AI By Example (Wordware Game Developers Library),Give some life to your game agents!,"If you are intererested in coding intelligente agent that can move around, flock, swarm, hunt and flee or follow a basic sort of strategic behaviour this text is an excellent choice. It offers practical examples examples of all of the above in the context of a simple soccer game and a search & destroy game called raven. Don 't expect 3D and fancy graphics. All games and concepts are 2D and the graphics is rudimentary at best, but that serves the puropose of keeping teh complexity of the book to manageable levels and the focus on AI programming. There is ton of example code to study and play with, and the little theory in the book basically is just an explanation of the code that the author has written. I would have liked to see more space dedicated to theory, and clearer and more genral explanations instead of ""here is the code that.."" but oh well better too much practice than too much theory.. and after all the book title makes it clear that this is a hands-on kind of text.

Definitely a must have book for the aspiring AI programmer or hobbist. Code is C++ but you don' t need to be a C++ guru, knowing the basics will serve you fine. Only one warning: you won 't get much out of this book is you don't spent a lot of time tinkering with the code presented and trying to extend it.",18
Mark B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Game AI By Example (Wordware Game Developers Library),OK,"It is as the title says, Programming Game AI by Example. Reading it, I felt that going more deeply into concepts rather than showing short snippets of code would have been more useful to me. I also felt that the code shown in the book was shallow at some points and really quite useless without the source code that the book provides a link to on the web. I learned more going through each class of the source code and seeing what each function actually did, rather than just seeing a few function calls in the example code in the book. Which may seem obvious enough, but the example code could have been left out entirely in my opinion and just referenced. However, it is all brought together quite nicely in the final game where the focus of each chapter is shown in a final product.

An entire chapter on HOW to script in lua could have been done away with (thats what tutorials are for) and instead been used for concepts of how it can be used. Plus I felt it was slightly out of place as I do not recall it being used in the final game either.

I am trying to code a game in flash actionscript and for that this book was not very helpful as I do not have all the libraries that the author uses in his source code and would have appreciated a book with a broader application. Personally I thought the book was merely OK, but realizing that because I didn't find it useful doesn't necessarily mean its bad, I'm giving it a 4.",4

J. Schrader,5.0 out of 5 stars,Inside PixInsight (The Patrick Moore Practical Astronomy Series),A Good Reference,"Overall a pretty nice guide to Pixinsight. The book is very similar to the video series that Warren Keller put out a few years back. Each aspect of processing is explained thoroughly, from image calibration to various methods of pulling in faint details from nonlinear stretched images. I prefer this to the videos as it is easier to reference while I am working in Pixinsight. The Kindle edition is very easy to follow. I prefer using my Android phone to read it as the Kindle Android App presents the book in color and allows you to zoom in on images.",5
Karl W. Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Inside PixInsight (The Patrick Moore Practical Astronomy Series),Required Reading,"One of the problems with PixInsight has been the lack of reference material. The developers, to their credit, have worked diligently to provide information to users in help files, procedure documentation, and even mouse over text, but this book provides a convenient overview from a man who is widely acknowledged to be a great astro-imager. If you're trying to learn how to use PixInsight, this book will certainly get you started.

Is it perfect? Maybe not, but, as it stands alone in the market, you'd be hard pressed to find anything better. And that's not to knock the book. It is easy to read; informative, authoritative, and detailed and practical. This book sets an extremely high bar, and any other author will have to work very hard to clear that bar if they want to compete.

In the book Mr. Keller covers image processing from start to finish, offering tips about acquisition as well as processing. It will take more than reading this book to make one an expert, but, having read the book one will be in a position, I think, to begin to become an expert. This book will, at the very least, carry a novice past the initial frustration with PixInsight, and embolden the novice to begin to explore the power of the program.

I'd recommend this book without reservation; it is well worth the price.",3
David G. Dahlstrom,3.0 out of 5 stars,Inside PixInsight (The Patrick Moore Practical Astronomy Series),I felt like information was being highly truncated to fit,"If I was brand new to PixInsight, I probably would have rated this higher, but I find that free online resources had already gotten me to 90% the level of understanding offered by this book, and in many cases much more thoroughly. In too many cases, I felt like information was being highly truncated to fit, and for a deeply technical product like PixInsight that's not good. With the exception of a few good tips here and there and the last few chapters that focused on specialized tools (again, too short on details), a good comprehensive list of web links would have served me just as well. What I'd love to see for PixInsight would be more like my 800 page Adobe Photoshop for Photographers book, rather than what seems like just a lightweight manual. So if you're brand new to PixInsight, you couldn't do worse starting with this book as a survey of PixInsight's major feature; but if you're already to the point of working productively with PixInsight, you are unlikely to find anything useful enough in here to justify the purchase.",2
Tyler B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Inside PixInsight (The Patrick Moore Practical Astronomy Series),An excellent hard copy Pixinsight resource!,"This is an excellent resource for developing a structured method for processing images with Pixinsight. The book does require that the reader/user has an elementary working knowledge of the program and on a personal note it was invaluable for me to have worked through preprocessing and and image processing using less involved methods from the internet. That previous experience gave me a better idea of the logic and direction the book was teaching. The book is an excellent complimentary resource to the many online videos and tutorials. In some cases the author even referenced some of the tutorials I had found and used on the internet. It's written in such a way that the reader can follow the steps exactly as written or use a layered approach, i.e. add additional steps as you learn.

From the first read through I learned additional steps that immediately helped me improve image quality. After using Pixinsight about a year before I purchased the book I finally feel like I have a structured processing path to build on and understand the logic of each step rather than just performing a laundry list of steps provided by others without an understanding of why.

The book is well worth the money!!",1
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Inside PixInsight (The Patrick Moore Practical Astronomy Series),Good for beginners - but lacking,"I haven't read the entire book yet, I'm around halfway through. So far, my experience has been, ""meh, it's okay"".

What I like:
- I learned some nifty new PI tricks. Including some tools that I didn't know about and shortcuts
- Keller follows the usual processing flow order which makes it easy to understand what to do and what order to do things in

What I don't like:
- Think of this book as a recipe book. It will tell you exactly what to do, but give very little explanation as to *why*. It's almost like Keller is trying to make it *too easy* to follow his book, and so he leaves out the details. It's good for beginners who just want to be told what to do - but there are lots of videos on YouTube that do exactly that.",1
Matt Ginsberg,2.0 out of 5 stars,TensorFlow for Machine Intelligence: A Hands-On Introduction to Learning Algorithms,"Not yet ready, and not that close","I originally thought this was a good book. I no longer think that.

It's not a book yet. It will probably be a good book at some point, but that point is not now.

The first few chapters ""work"". I was able to work through them and everything came out just like it should have. With chapter 5, that completely stopped.

At a high level, what's going on for me is that the examples stopped being self-contained. They don't really tell you where to initialize tf sessions, where to initialize the variables, etc. They just give you code that is supposed to somehow work (but doesn't).

I've spent many hours trying to figure this out. From the point labeled ""convert images to TFRecords"" and forward, I just can't get anything to happen. I've tried typing everything into python and running it, both with a tensorflow session and without. I've tried running code I downloaded with jupyter and ipython. I just get a bunch of complaints about widgets being unavailable, kernels not existing, and notebooks not being trusted. I've installed a ton of stuff (ipython, jupyter, widgetsnbextension and ipywidgets, for starters) and nothing helps. I've looked at the various manual pages for tensorflow, and that doesn't help, either.

The good: Overall I found the book to be very accessible and an easy introduction to Tensorflow. It takes its time to explain key TF concepts and how they work in the context of machine learning. Examples are good and accessible.

The bad: Did they forget to proof read the book? On page 96 there's a section called ""Logging with TensorBoard"" but there's no actual text in that section, just the heading.

fitzalling,4.0 out of 5 stars,Only Humans Need Apply: Winners and Losers in the Age of Smart Machines,A Positive Look at Humanity's Opportunity to Live with Artificial Intelligence,"Let me start by saying that this book is well worth reading. This is the third of three books that I decided to read to gain perspective on the Information, some say Digital, Age. The first book was ""Information: a Very Short Introduction"" which I used to gain an overview of information itself. The second was ""The Hacked World Order"" which provided a useful overview of how nations, corporations, organized and aggressive political groups (think ISIS), and affiliations operating on the Internet (think Anonymous) compete, struggle, spy, undertake war, and the like on a national and global scale. With ""Only Humans Need Apply"" I hoped to gain insight into the effect of artificial intelligence in the Information Age on daily lives of humans. This book provides that insight.

The authors' argue that artificial intelligence should not and will not replace humans, but artificial intelligence will augment natural human capacities (empathy, integrity, creativity) which will not easily be reduced to logical rules and computer codes. They recognize that, in some areas, and the list of areas grows, the artificial intelligence of machines exceeds the natural intelligence of humans. The authors quote Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates in expressing deep concern over this development (pp. 225-6 in the hardback). The book focuses on how humans may respond to the expanding power and scope of artificial intelligence using human qualities that augment smart machines as smart machines augment the power of humans.

The book identifies five ways in which people may adapt to smart machines. These adaptive approaches are labeled stepping up, stepping aside, stepping in, stepping narrowly and stepping forward. The authors identify what each approach means, the type of people that may be drawn to or enabled to perform that particular adaptive approach, and the business organizations which may benefit from each approach. If you, as a reader, sometimes flinch at the business book style, I think you'll find these authors to be sufficiently thoughtful and non-dogmatic enough to warrant a careful review of their analysis. I personally expect that many individuals who are knowledge workers will use more than one adaptive approach as artificial intelligence encroaches into their world. According to the book, if you are in the insurance underwriting business smart machines already have a large beach head in your business. Radiologists and certain types of medical doctors are also experiencing the intrusion of smart machines into their professional lives.

Towards the end of the book, the authors touch on the possibility of war being waged by autonomous smart machines. They realize that there have been popular movies based on this premise. I would have been interested in a more expansive examination of this possible phenomenon. Perhaps they will explore this in their next book.

My one criticism, and it is the reason I gave the book four, and not five, stars, lies in what I sense is their underlying assumption that the world largely consists of persons with the intellectual gifts of the average denizen of MIT. The world doesn't. Artificial intelligence will negate the employment potential for an increasing number of people. This is not good. But artificial intelligence is a genii that will not go back into the bottle. The authors do not suggest that it will They are correct to look for ways to accommodate this genii. For this reason I strongly recommend it.",2

Tom Davenport’s book presents an outstanding, compelling, yet frightening case for everyone to pay more attention to automation and the impact it has on our own jobs. This book is a must read for every one and yes I mean everyone in the workforce in all industries and all roles. This books arms the human reader with various navigation paths to ensure future employment. Davenport explores in a very comprehensive way the future of work. This comprehensive journey reviews many industries and the impact that machines, artificial intelligence and computers have on work and what the future mix of human work versus computer work might be. This book is well grounded in technology history which makes it an interesting read as it is helpful to remember how we got here. The authors makes a compelling, yet sometimes, scary case for computer automation or rather the potential impact of current trends by reviewing the history of automation in each use case they profile. The book offers tips for human work for this new techno dominated workplace. The book focuses heavily on Insurance Underwriting, Stock Trading, Marketing Process Management and more. The book left a number of very provocative questions in my mind such as: 1) What should I do now to retool my skill set now? 2) Which industries, and job categories should I pursue and 3) Can senior management jobs be automated, how Cognitive can automation get? The book speculates what will happen with knowledge workers of which executive management is a part, but the question is does this extend to senior executive management and the board? (The book explores some aspects of this question.)
I love the reference to Steve Job’s and how it wasn’t his ability to code that made him a genius, it was his multi-disciplinary background that allowed him to add a “tweak” to a technical process based on deep knowledge of physics, calligraphy, art and computers. I think the idea of Augmentation also applies to how computers themselves were created by people like Allen Turing (See the film “The Imitation Game”) and others. In Turing’s case what saved millions of lives was someone’s ability to listen and have an intuition(Augmentation) about a very complex in that case mathematical problem involving life and death. It is interesting how these leaders were not only technology savvy but also multi-disciplinary (Creative, intuitive, rationale, mathematical/technical and both left and right brained).
Overall this is book is a must read for everyone in the modern workforce. Davenport and Kirby are subject matter experts on these topics and are extremely credible as evidenced by the research that went into this book. I recommend the reader devour this book and create a career plan to retool skill sets based on the 5 paths identified in the book.
• Stepping Up: Become involved with decision-making that computers can’t make but can assist
• Stepping Aside: Move to non-decision-oriented areas in which computers cannot assist
• Stepping in: Improve computer-generated decisions
• Stepping Narrowly: Be a specialize in work that cannot be automated
• Stepping Forward: Develop new systems and technology that support intelligent decisions and actions

Chapter 3, pages 76-77.",2
Tom Redman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Only Humans Need Apply: Winners and Losers in the Age of Smart Machines,"This is a terrific book, perhaps Davenport’s best and most important","This is a terrific book, perhaps Davenport’s best and most important. For this review, I’m picking out three things I especially like. First, is the notion of how AI penetrates business. Its proponents have been making extravagant claims about its potential for a good long while, and it is easy to be dismissive. But Davenport and Kirby offer a solid rationale and “means of diffusion” through which it can happen, and some solid advise on how managers can make it happen.

Second, is the notion, and full explanation, of “augmentation.” I have, of course, seem the basic outline before. Here Davenport and Kirby provide the right level of argument that, for many/most/nearly all it is a terrific way to advance their careers and the cogent steps that people can actually take. I hope everyone sees a better future for themselves in here.

Third, is this book is extremely well-written, especially for such a tough and important subject area. The authors don’t shy away from hard issues and they do a good job both in presenting both sides and exposing their feelings. Finally, several passages are pretty darn funny.

I advise readers to mark up their copies—you’re going to go back to it over and over.",1
Brandy - Reading Enthusiast,5.0 out of 5 stars,Only Humans Need Apply: Winners and Losers in the Age of Smart Machines,An empowering and reassuring look at present and future collaborations between man and machine!,"What I like best about Only Humans Need Apply is its balance between getting the reader concerned about the rise of smart machines, and the advice it provides to knowledge workers about what they can do about it. Several other books on the subject suggest that there is little or nothing that can stop machines from taking over our jobs and perhaps even becoming our robot overlords. This book is both empowering and less alarming but still argues that there is a valid concern on the jobs issue (it doesn’t spend much time on the robot overlord question, which is a relief). What I liked best about it though is that it goes on to suggest five different types of roles that humans can play in coexisting. I don’t know if these are the only options or how many jobs they will save, but at the very least the suggestions and ideas are both constructive and relatively optimistic options. A must read for those who plan to move into or want to succeed in the many professions where smart machines are playing larger and larger roles.",1

Scheid,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Echo: 2017 Edition - User Guide and Manual - Learn It Live It Love It,Learn to Operate Alexa – this is the best place!,"When I bought my Echo device, I didn’t have 100% trust in the device mainly because despite the majority of the Echo customers saying this is a good product there are the others who have complains. Mostly some say that Alexa cannot or does not respond to their commands or that they have to yell at it. Some say that other voice commanding devices such as Siri or Pandora and stuff worked better for them. But my earlier experience with both Siri and Cortana were horrible. So there goes why I didn’t trust Echo.

But after reading this brilliant manual, also comprehensive manual (I have to mention)…. I think that the people who had complains just didn’t have a guide as good as this. If you have doubts or trouble working with Echo, try this. This is miraculously the only time I could function a voice activated device well. And all that credit I give this book. This took me through all the nooks and crannies of using Echo, features, limitations, initial set up etc.",1

calvinnme,4.0 out of 5 stars,Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision,Good on the explanations of the theory,"This book is very complete and rigorous in its explanations of the theory. However, I just think I like the approach in An Invitation to 3-D Vision a bit better. This book is better illustrated than that one and is more careful in its explanations, but this book just seems more focused on providing complete proofs than giving you a feel for how you would approach a real problem. Even the exercises are more along the lines of proofs. I like how An Invitation to 3-D Vision ends the book with a complete example. In all fairness, though, this book does have quite a bit of Matlab code on its website.

The book begins with some background material on 2D and 3D geometry. Then the author explains single-view geometry and how cameras map an image in 3D space to an image. Two-view geometry is next, with the author describing the epipolar geometry of two cameras ahd projective reconstruction from resulting image map correspondences. Part three of the book extends ideas to three cameras and the resulting trifocal geometry. The final section of the book takes the algorithms of the book to N views. Thus this book has a simple and straightforward structure that belies the complexity of the material.

If you are really researching this subject you should probably have this book for explanation, illustrations, and rigor, and the Invitation book for enlightenment through a good example-based approach. You should also have Introductory Techniques for 3-D Computer Vision as a text on the individual pieces of algorithms involved in 3D vision. And don't even think about getting into this subject unless you already have a firm foundation in linear algebra, image processing, and computer vision in general as found in Computer Vision, which is my favorite introductory computer vision text.",24

Any writer on computer vision faces the problem of guessing who the reader is likely to be and what the reader's background is. Also, each of the various topics really merits a sizable book. In particular, the mathematics needs a truly mathematical treatment in a separate book. I have not seen this second edition, but there was room for improvement over the first edition.",10

David Taylor,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Artificial Intelligence for Humans, Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms",A Basic Introduction to Machine Learning,"This book claims to be an overview of artificial intelligence, but it’s not; it’s an overview of machine learning. It’s true that machine learning is a hot topic within AI just now, but it's hardly taken over the field, nor has it rendered all other methods obsolete. But, if you just want an informal introduction to the basic forms of machine learning, it's short and easy to read. The rubber never quite meets the road, but if all you need is the basic concepts, it's not a bad start.

It does, however, contain errors that really should have been caught prior to publication. In addition to the errors mentioned by another reviewer, the references to equations 10.2 through 10.4 are wrong, and the description of the logistic function shown in Figure 10.3 doesn’t match the function shown. The notation specifies the curve as going from 0 to , but it is drawn from 1 to 0, which is backward from what the author intended. Also, the curve is described in the text as a logit function, which the author seems to confuse with the logistic. They both has S shapes, but they are very different things with different roles to play in terms of how they bound their values. To put it graphically, the S of a logit is horizontal, with the tails extending up and down, not vertical with tails to the left and right as shown in the figure.",17

The first chapters introduce the readers to the fundamentals of human vision and how the brain processes light, contrast and color. The examples are clear and understandable.
As the book progresses, the subjects become more complex and mathematically-oriented. I found that I could follow up with those topics in which I had prior background, like intensity transformations, spatial filtering, filtering in the frequency domain, color image processing, image compression and image segmentation. In these topics I understood most of what they were explaining, except maybe the last pages of each chapter.
When it came to chapters where I was weaker or not familiar at all, I have to admit that I was able to keep up only with the first pages of each one. More specifically: Wavelets and multithreshold processing, morphological image processing, representation, fuzzy logic and object recognition. These chapters became muddy very quickly, and I only got a general feeling about what they were explaining.
Maybe someone with an electrical engineering background (myself being mechanical/software) would understand better the advanced topics.
I plan to read them again once I have a practical need or use for those areas.
The book does not contain code samples but it has quite a lot of practical use examples with pictures.
In summary, I understood roughly 65% of the book and would recommend it to anyone who needs a better understanding of image processing.

Thomas Edward,5.0 out of 5 stars,Digital Image Processing (3rd Edition),A Valuable Learning Aid,"I just completed a semester of Digital Image Processing where this was the course textbook. Of the myriad textbooks I have used over the years, this one is definitely at the top of my list in terms of its clarity and organization. I ended up reading at least two thirds of this textbook, and the way that the authors present the material makes it very clear in most cases. I came away with the sense that the authors expended a great deal of effort in illustrating and explaining the concepts - more so than many textbooks I have encountered, especially those at the graduate engineering level.

My only criticism is that certain parts of chapters 7 and 8 seemed a bit too extensive for an introductory image processing text; however, they were still good chapters and so I don't think that it warrants a deduction of a star in my rating.

Matthew Todd,2.0 out of 5 stars,Digital Image Processing (3rd Edition),Typical computer science textbook,"tl;dr: I found the book was confusing, convoluted, and generally useless. Rambling review follows.

I got this book for a digital image processing course (cse 166 at UCSD with Serge Belongie.) The course (especially the lectures) was really good, unfortunately the book didn't measure up.

I generally find that computer science/programming (or college) books in general fall into two categories:

1) Easy to read and understand, but still leaving a question as to how I would implement something. These books are generally things that are there to provoke insight in the reader without giving them all the answers. They serve to lay out a general road to follow where the reader has to think and discover for themselves.

I'd consider books like Programming Pearls, Fowler's Refactoring, Gang of Four's Design Patterns, etc. to be in this category.

2) Hard to read, understand, and generally useless. I consider the reviewed textbook to be one of these. I found that the book was hard to understand even after having attended lecture and done the homework. Hell, I got an A in the class and if I were to go back and read the book, it probably would still be very confusing.

I feel the biggest issue is how the authors chose to approach the examples. Their explanations of how they solved the examples was confusing and skipped a lot of steps. Even more frustrating is how simple the examples could be in comparison to the homework problems. The book, however, was useful for seeing alternate implementations/algorithms for a task.

I don't regret having bought the book or done the reading, as confusing as it was. Perhaps it was helpful getting an alternate description, but it certainly didn't feel that way. I don't think this book would be useful on its own, unless one happens to be really good at using these types of books.

ps:

Note, this is simply my (simple and unrefined) opinion on computer science/programming books. Not some grand theory.

Sorry for the vagueness, but its hard to pin down exactly what I found to be unsatisfactory about the book. Hopefully some of it managed to show through.",5
kebowdog,1.0 out of 5 stars,Digital Image Processing (3rd Edition),Might as well just buy it used.,"I chose standard shipping, and it took nearly the entire 14 business days to arrive, but the real problem was the condition when it arrived.

A. Panda,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making (McGraw-Hill Series in Social Psychology),Are we rational decision makers?,"First we need to define what we understand under rational. Initially, researchers measured human rationality by analyzing the degree of ""maximization"" of utility (net wealth) of their decisions. Using this approach, we seemed not too ""rational"". Then they came up with a value function, defined in terms of gains and losses as deviations from a reference point and which incorporates decreasing returns. (For a deeper explanation read Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics). This curve makes the loss segment steeper than the profit segment (""S-shaped curve""). When measured against this function we seemed a bit more rational. For me, this should come as no surprise since decision making was probably a bit more oriented at preserving our lives and escaping dangers (loss part of the function) than at obtaining food. It would not be too useful to be the best food gatherer if you succumbed to your enemies at the first opportunity. (This is probably my first ""hindsight bias"", which means that after knowing the outcome of a study, we tend to say that we knew it from the beginning).

Apparently we tend to ""satisfice"" not ""optimize"", which for me is obvious (second hindsight bias) and I will try to explain why: In several of the examples, in order to ""maximize"" value, you need to multiply one probability with one or several others to obtain the ""combined probability result"" of two or more events happening one after the other. In other problems, you need to add up the individual probabilities in order to obtain the probability of one or the other event happening. Assuming that you knew how to state the problem in terms of probabilities and the rules to calculate them, you would still need to actually perform the calculations (consciously or unconsciously) in order to take a decision. Many decisions need to be taken quickly and even if there is enough time, I do not think people usually do these calculations, so they probably rely on some sort of intuition (what the author calls heuristics or rules of thumb). These rules of thumb will depend on past experiences specially on those that are easily accesible to memory because they were frequent or recent or because they had a great emotional impact on us (positive or negative). If to ""maximize value"" we need to perform complex calculations, then I am sure we do not ""maximize"", we rather settle with a fairly good decision. Further, if we need to ""maximize value"" in order to be considered rational, then we are probably not rational.

It would have been interesting to know how people decide when previously given the calculated expected values of each choice (considering the probabilities). I think that ""rationality"" would increase a bit, but not significantly, since some people believe they can ""outperform"" the odds (by special luck), while others try to avoid undesirable risks, even if the probabilities are very low (specially if the impact of the risk is big).

The book explains thoroughly how we deviate from what would be ""rational"" decision making. Each of the 20 chapters presents research that exemplifies one or more biases like inconsistency, perception and memory biases, framing, intransitivity, neglecting base rates, attribution errors, social loafing, sunk costs and behavioral traps. It makes quite clear that we do not decide in a ""rational"" way, but it does not explain the actual process we use to make decisions. Additionally, the author shows that we are not good at probability and statistical analysis, but he does not explain the calculations we should have done were we ""rational decision makers"". (He could have included it in an Appendix). If you already know this kind of math or if you are not interested, then the book can be read without it. After reading this book I tried some books on probability and randomness The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives (Vintage) narrates the history of probability theory and explains it in a general manner with day to day examples that are quite interesting and Taking Chances: Winning with Probability inlcudes more examples and requires you to take paper and pencil to do the math. Finally and although the book is very interesting and full of insights, I need to say that I am glad that I bought a used one, since its price seems not too rational to me either.",4
Abacus,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making (McGraw-Hill Series in Social Psychology),Excellent and insightful.,"This is a fascinating book analyzing how we are all far less Cartesian than we think. In other words, a slew of predictable human bias flaws what we feel is our own objective judgment. The author eminently demonstrates this point by forcing the reader to take a 39 questions test at the beginning of the book. This test is stuffed with all the traps that illustrate the human judgment flaws that he analyzes thoroughly in following specific chapters.
You can view the test as a very entertaining IQ test from hell. The questions seem often simple. But, they are not. Other times, they are obviously difficult. I got a bit more than half of them correct. This was mainly because I had some knowledge or experience regarding certain traps the questions presented. I had made the mistake before. So, I learned from that. When I did not have any prior knowledge of a question, my results were very human, meaning not that good. But, learning the correct answer was both fun and educating.
The author touches on several fascinating probability and statistic concepts. One of them being the Bayes theorem, which suggests that medical screen test can be highly unreliable despite being touted as 80% to 90% accurate. In other words, you better understand the Bayes theorem better than the medical specialists who screen you for various diseases. Because, based on the author's study, doctors don't have a clue. Another chapter had an excellent discussion on correlation vs. causation. This includes some tricky nuances that many analysts in the financial industry trip upon. Another interesting probability concept is why it takes only 23 people in a room to have greater than a 50% that two of them share the same birthday. This seems impossible, but it is true.
The book has obviously a lot more than I am letting on here. I am not going to ruin it for you. It is really fun, educating, and interesting to read. You will also learn a whole lot about how you think, how others think, and how people think in groups. You will also understand how tricky it is to ask truly open and objective questions. Also, polls that seem objective are not due to the subjective structure of the question. I think you will enjoy this book, and I strongly recommend it.",150
T SANTOSO,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making (McGraw-Hill Series in Social Psychology),A lot of materials in this Great Book,"This is a very dense book, relatively easy to read, and very2 helpful. I love Blink and The Tipping Point, but this book probably has much much more materials, arguably more than 5 times of inside that those two best sellers combined.

I am very interested in the popular psycology stuffs, and Influence by Cialdini is my fav. So this book in some way give you the same chockful of surprises and new insight that will change the way you think.

I came across recomended by a University of Chicago MBA -email friend- who has much similar books favourites and he recomended this highly, and i absolutely agree and i would be glad to recommend this to anyone interested in human behaviour and psychology of bias.

MBA students should read this one and surely will enjoy this. I always draw, marks and put notes on my book and i think i end up marking so much of the materials.

Section one: Perception, Memory and Context

Section two: How Questions affect answers

Section three: Model of Decision making

Section Four: Heurictis and Biases.

Section five: The Social side of judgment and decision making

As the title suggests, this book builds the foundations of machine learning, which are omitted in every other machine learning text book that I've read. This book will prepare you for advanced, research level machine learning papers. There is no other book like it - absolutely incredible! This is the book that experts and professors in the field learn from. Even if you have 10+ years of experience in the field, I'm sure that you will learn something new every time you pick up the book. Furthermore, the book is concise enough that even an beginner could learn from it. Although any beginner should be prepared to read more on their own.

Very useful as a base for your monitor.",16
Andrew,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",Good for overview and intuition,"First of all, I would advise to think of this as a 400-page book with a WEKA appendix. Its price is about right for a 400-page machine learning textbook, and you don't even need to know that WEKA exists for the first 400 pages. I never read any of the WEKA stuff and got tons out of the textbook part.

There's very little actual math or theory in this book. The average explanation amounts to ""There's a technique called X, where you do this... it has a couple problems, but you could try fixing them in these ways."" It's great for getting a lot of machine learning and data mining ideas in your head without having to get confused by learning the math behind them.

Problems mostly come from the lack of organization. Most of these are in Chapter 6, which is by far the most important chapter. For instance, this chapter begins with two or three pages describing what's going on in Figure 1.3 from two-hundred pages earlier. Each section of the chapter references its corresponding section in Chapter 4 a lot. The authors also assume that you memorized, in intimate detail, their examples in the first five pages because they keep referencing them in detail throughout the book. Finally, the explanations of a couple algorithms -- decision trees, in particular -- can get disorganized and confusing; however, these are exceptions to the rule.

But, this is a good book. I got a lot of new ideas out of it for how to improve some the algorithms I work on, or for new things to try. It's great to have explanations of these machine learning algorithms and concepts that give you an intuition for what their goal/purpose is without going into too much detail about why they work -- there are ten other books for that.",1
Sefa,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",good textbook to start machine learning / data mining,"The book is really good to start learning machine learning and data mining.

Pros
- It doesn't jump into algorithms with mathematical details. It starts with what is it all about, what input and output look like in typical machine learning problems.
- One point that I really liked is that the book gives algorithms in two chapters (chapter 4 and 6). The first chapter is about basics and latter one gives detail about these algorithms.
- It also covers well that I think it is mostly ignored by other books/tutorials: practical issues. How to normalize data, what happens your data have both categorical and numerical features, discretizing numerical features and so on.
- If you consider using Weka, you should have this book. Authors are from the team who built Weka. For each algorithm described in the book, corresponding names of implementations in Weka are given too. With the book it is easier to understand parameters of Weka implementations of algorithms. Also last part of the book is like extensive Weka tutorial.

Cons
- In a few points, the book contains unnecessary details, although it is not the case for overall of the book. One of such things that I remember is chapter 4.7. The book spends 5 whole pages to how to find nearest neighbor efficiently (not-easy stuff), which I think it is really implementation detail. Instead of it, it could explain what nearest neighbor is, or something else.
- The part about Weka has several figures, mostly Weka screen shots. It was difficult to follow these figures, because of black-white screen shots. I think these figures should be in color in the next edition, which will make much easier to follow.",4
John M. Ford,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",Two Paths to Prediction,"This is a good text on machine learning techniques from both the statistics and the machine learning perspectives. The authors note that these fields have developed in parallel with many researchers and practitioners working in each, but few familiar with the full range of techniques in both disciplines. Some procedures, such as tree induction and nearest neighbor clustering techniques, have been developed independently in both fields. However, for the most part statistics has focused on hypothesis testing and machine learning has tried to optimize search through the space of possible hypotheses. This book presents techniques from both traditions.

The organizational structure of the book supports its use as either a comprehensive text or a modular reference. The first section's five chapters introduce the foundations of data mining. In addition to concepts and definitions, there are simple example data sets and accessible descriptions of how both raw data and final analyses are used in this field. A particularly well-written fifth chapter discusses how to evaluate data mining models. It discusses the rationale for holdout samples, the use of cross-validation procedures, and how to avoid over-fitting models. Machine learning texts frequently lack depth on this topic while statistics texts often fail to communicate the consequences of poorly-fitted models. This integration of perspectives is a good one.

Chapters in the second section build on this foundation. Chapter 6 describes how to use ten different techniques to detect and describe patterns in large data sets. This section also describes how to prepare data for data mining, how to combine and transform variables to increase model accuracy, and how to improve prediction by combining different model types using bagging, boosting, and other aggregation techniques. A final chapter outlines directions of current and future research expanding our toolbox of techniques. The eight chapters of the third and final section are a detailed tutorial covering the Weka workbench of machine learning algorithms and data transformation tools.

This book has several communication strengths. The scope is broad for an introductory text. The Further Readings collections at each chapter's end are reasonably brief and point to current and in-depth sources. The text itself contains numerous example analyses and follows the useful strategy of analyzing the same data with several techniques. Its review of algorithms and formulas focuses on explaining how they work rather than on deriving them from general principles. A key strength is the book's close integration with Weka. This ensures that readers can step through analysis procedures, experiment with variations from default paths, and compare the performance of different formulations of the same research problems.

I recommend the book for readers introducing themselves to machine learning. It will take some of your time to learn the techniques and practice using them in Weka, but it will be time well spent. Don't skip the Weka section!",1
Jochen Albrecht,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",You will need some time but it is worth the investment,"To get the most out of this book, you need to either be a statistician, AI professional, or be willing to invest some time. But: if you commit yourself, then this book goes a long way to substitute for a graduate-level course on data mining. Don't get me wrong - it is not written with an academic audience in mind; as a matter of fact, it is unusually rich with application examples. But there is a lot to digest conceptually and many of the examples are quite involved. As such, it addresses the opposite end the O'Reilly series of how-to books. This one gets you up to speed with one of if not the best software package for data mining in all its many facets. With Weka and 'R', you have the tools to tackle many of the World's problems, and this book is the best introduction to one part of the duo.",5
Someone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",A good introduction,"Good:

Provides a good overview of the field as well as basic concepts in everyday language. It tries to explain any jargon that it introduces. I'm going to disagree with a reviewer. The book is not WEKA focused and is useful for people even if they are not going to use WEKA. Even if the book had a strong focus on WEKA, I don't see what's wrong given that WEKA is free and open source and widely used for machine learning and data mining. I'll elaborate more on this subject in the Bad section.

Provides both overviews as well as more detailed discussions (such as potential applications) related to various types of commonly used algorithms. I felt the diagrams it presents were key to understanding the concepts.

Applies the concepts using a library called WEKA.

Bad:

I didn't think the book focused enough on application. It's great to learn theory, but personally I don't learn a subject very well if I don't have enough opportunities to apply it. I totally disagree with another reviewer. I felt that the book should have had MORE content related to WEKA. Yes, WEKA is free and open source but there is so little documentation written on it compared to other Java libraries and frameworks. More content on it would have been better since there isn't a definitive book on it that didn't solely focus on the GUI application portion of WEKA. Besides there are plenty of other good books that focus on data mining and machine learning. This is the only one for WEKA.",2

Through all its editions, the book's distinguishing feature has been its balance of theory and practice. It is, of course, the WEKA book, and all the algorithms covered have been implemented by the authors in the WEKA data mining workbench. Part 3 covers WEKA; in my opinion, this section could be left to the web site.

- the WEKA coverage is mind numbingly bad. Lists of algorithm names without explanations of those algorithms and no real practical advice or examples using the program.

An Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Accelerated Spanish: Learn fluent Spanish with a proven accelerated learning system,Speak and think like a native as soon as possible!,"Well Timothy’s done it again. This material isn’t new as far as it being available to the public, but it’s delivery has been completely revised. It’s the same message in a new medium built to reach a wider audience, an audience desperately in need of real instruction on how to acquire another language and use it like a native speaker.

I have to confess. I haven’t reached the goal of native fluency yet, but this is only by choice. It’s been my choice to examine my own ability to gain and lose fluency over time. I originally decided I would not seek out a language coach if only to see how far I could get on my own. I’ve had many conversations in Spanish, mostly broken, before finding the Accelerated Spanish course a few weeks after moving abroad. This was with a vocabulary picked up the month before solely by flashcards. Maybe 200-500 words.

I’ve been able to travel across a foreign country by myself encountering very few English speakers. It wasn’t easy all the time. But none of it has been so easy since finding Timothy Moser’s Accelerated Spanish material. Of course it becomes easy only after some effort is put forth.

I know a few native speakers, and after being exposed to the system in this book, my ability to think and speak improved drastically. Yes there were those other audio books that helped, but none of them drove home the basics, the real basics, like the author of this book has.

Those basics are the structural words of the language. Without being exposed to the structure of the language, I was at a loss for where to take my first step any time it came to building sentences or whenever I was listening to a native speaker certain words would blend together. Sure, those audio books helped if I warmed up in the morning, but I don’t want to repeat phrases blindly with the feeling something’s missing. Or if I skip a day or two I feel like I’ve made no progress.

What sets this material apart from the rest is that it guides you in using your imagination to build that part in yourself that speaks Spanish fluently – a part you build yourself by ‘being the bee’, using an imaginary character, a bee with a funny accent and a few quirks that share a similarity to our Spanish speaking friends.

This is not to be taken lightly. Most native speakers are not going to show you how to use your speaking apparatus the way they use theirs. Regular practice of the basics contained here for about a week or so sets in place an unbreakable foundation, a jumping off point for speaking with and understanding native speakers.

Using the power of mnemonics, especially stressed syllable mnemonics, plenty of words can be integrated with the Spanish speaking part of your mind. Imagining three pandas, which you learn early on represent the third person plural usage (or conjugation if you really want) of a verb, standing on the tail of a lizard (another character representing the third person singular), inside of a store with a starry (those things in space) background. Here is our mnemonic that drives home the proper pronunciation of ‘estan’, which could maybe be translated as ‘they are (doing)’. Jeez, what are they doing? They are standing on his tail that’s what!

It’s faster to do than write about. And if you think that is a whole lot of work just to remember one word think about the imaginary scene with its mnemonics as a cast. A cast is used to set a bone in place. Once the bone is in place, you don’t need the cast anymore. You discard the cast and move on. Actually, you don’t move on.

You need to exercise those muscles attached to the bone because chances are they’ve begun to atrophy (unless you practice muscle controls, but that’s another topic) or in our case as language learners were never developed in the first place. This muscle building is the next step of our learning adventure.

Once enough bones are set you are ready to begin building muscle. The muscles in our case are the phrases and dialogues. Practicing these and listening to these are keys to making the language one’s own. Mimicking the patterns and then being able to reproduce them at will (and then under pressure – healthy directed pressure which a language coach is meant to provide) are exercises in speaking fluidly. Oh you mean fluently? Whatever you want, they’re just words.

Let’s briefly cover a few structural words of the language and the functions they perform:

y – Say ‘eeh!’ as if you’re frightened, or something’s nasty. This word connects other words together like ‘and’ does in English.

que – No, not que’ with the last syllable stressed, but que. Think the letter ‘K’. Probably the most used word in the language, it’s used to connect phrases in a sentence similar to our ‘that’ that does the same thing, not to be confused with ‘that over there’, used as a more than or less than, and maybe a few others. Point being, not being aware of its function from the beginning don’t expect to be able to hear it when native speakers are conversing.

de – Of, from. As in I come from the ‘day’light.

por – by, around, near. It’s all so easy when you associate this with a ‘pour’ing waterfall coming out of ‘por’ous rock.

a – to – another easy one when you put it near the waterfall, which you are going ‘to’.

There’s also the direct objects, indirect objects, and idiomatic usage (combining direct objects with que). These all describe what or whom you’re talking to or about.

Every word mentioned here has its own scene or location where it’s been placed already. The imaginary groundwork put down by the author makes it hard not to learn the language if you go step by step. And it’s these first few steps that are the most important, yet so simple.

Climbing step by step up the staircase of language learning, the book teaches idiomatic usage of words that can’t be directly translated using only the words learned up to that point. A little Spanglish is fine to get started.

Now, the author uses a three-module system that’s been tried and tested many times over with many students who opted to take private coaching sessions. This is the first book of a three-part series and even if you only buy and study this one book an unbreakable foundation will have been built. But since this book does not contain the full system to achieve fluency, I’d rather tell you why I was so drawn to this method for achieving fluency.

I’ve studied Italian. I have Italian relatives and I’m also Italian born in America (the one with the states that are united). I’ve heard it many times without being unable to understand it, but I can make the sounds like a native for the most part and I’ve had plenty of lessons on the grammar and all of that. Still I was not satisfied, maybe it was time for a private tutor or find somebody to talk to on the internet.

No, there must be some intermediate step I thought. I was also interested in memory techniques. Even though I knew of mnemonics like the ones used in the book I still wanted to try my hand at rote memorization. For a time I memorized short stories in Italian, from an interlinear text of the same name (Sir Anthony Panizzi). The results were amazing. The memorizing sessions had me go from crawling to walking as far as thinking (and speaking of course) in the language goes. Despite not practicing for years, whenever I hear the Italian language it’s like seeing (or hearing) old friends I haven’t seen in a while who I could do some catching up with, yet the memories are still there.

Being undecisive whether I should focus on Spanish, being more practical in this city, or Italian, which is slightly closer to the heart, I ended up doing neither until I had a chance to travel abroad and visit old friends since childhood. It just so happens they lived in a country where the majority speak Spanish. See I knew I should have did Spanish!!

Remembering the fun I had with the Italian stories I went off in search of something similar in Spanish. But I needed some good audio to pick up the Latin American accent, preferring not to sound like a Spaniard. Every product or website I tried never measured up until I came across Timothy’s Master of Memory website. Of course I didn’t find it until I was almost a month into my stay abroad but better late than never. The accents used in the dialogues and the clarity of explanation was just what I was looking for.

Once you begin to practice the material in this book and listen to the dialogues, idiomatic Spanish will come to you like one of those songs that sticks in your mind. Start singing parts of the song and the other parts are on call, much like your own native tongue is at your beck and call with idiomatic phrasing that you’ve been exposed to your entire life from the places you’ve lived and the different songs and shows listened to. Learning a language doesn’t happen by chance, but with some effort directed in the right places it might seem that way.

Everything in this book and I expect in the upcoming two volumes has been refined over and over again by its author without losing its potency. In fact, the content can’t be beat for the price. It’s hard to put a price tag on learning material that works for you and not against you.

To sum this book up and its system of learning: almost every word, if not every word, in this book is designed, from the author’s experience, to make the Spanish language and its parts stick as quickly as possible. When it takes a minimal amount of time to learn something, more time is available to become so familiar with the material you really have no choice but to succeed.",9
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Accelerated Spanish: Learn fluent Spanish with a proven accelerated learning system,The REAL DEAL if you want to be fluent in Spanish,"Timothy Moser is a genius! Accelerated Spanish teaches real Spanish fluency by teaching in a way that focuses on words and grammar structures most often used in the language. Instead of starting with colors or objects like most conventional Spanish classes do, this course teaches you what you need most first and then fills in the language. I haven't gotten through all of it yet, but I have been awe struck by how effective the advice and lessons have been. I studied Spanish for 6 years in middle school and high school, but have been out of practice for a few years and honestly was never comfortable talking to native speakers. After two weeks of Accelerated Spanish, I was able to pick up the phone and talk to a native Spanish speaker. It isn't comfortable yet, and I am still not close to being a good speaker, but his method really increased my comfort and confidence in the language.

AND I love how this is really about teaching Spanish and not about making money off a gimmick. Timothy Moser has been super open about sharing content and has replied for my questions even though I had not purchased anything. I've been recommending this course to my friends ever since I started it!",9
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Accelerated Spanish: Learn fluent Spanish with a proven accelerated learning system,You'll be amazed your ability to form sentences and use correct structure in a short amount of time!,"This book and the Accelerated Spanish full coaching program is by far the best way to learn Spanish. You'll use a memory palace to learn groups of words and conjugations of verbs with easy recall. Eventually the recall becomes natural and you begin speaking ""in your Spanish voice"" rather than thinking in English first then trying to translate. I honestly think that the coaching element to this program is key because your must practice with native speakers to become fluent. However, this book will blow your mind compared to other methods of study. I highly recommend you check it out!!!",14

E. PROKOPOW,5.0 out of 5 stars,Accelerated Spanish: Learn fluent Spanish with a proven accelerated learning system,"Learn what Spanish you need, not just a list you memorize","You took a trip to a Spanish-speaking country (or maybe to a Spanish-speaking neighborhood closer to home). You wandered thru or near a park playground or a busy swimming pool or beach, close enough to overhear conversations. And then you felt the frustration of not being able to follow the conversation in Spanish of 3- and 4-year-old kids! Accelerated Spanish's focus on frequently-used words over rote vocabulary lists by function (""and now here is a list things you find in a classroom! oh boy!) is a remarkably different way to approach language learning, e.g., think about how many times you will need to use the noun ""backpack"" or ""chalkboard"" over the expression for ""to him"" or ""I used to"" or ""she was going"". (Answer: none). You'll really appreciate the emphasis on pronouns, extremely commonly used verbs and all their tenses, including subjunctive. Timothy even addresses techniques to ""unlearn"" certain information that you were probably taught incorrectly (as was I). You'll retain more, and more rapidly, than you ever thought you could too.",25

I highly recommend either version of the book to any Spanish language learner, even if you think that you know a lot of vocabulary. Moser teaches grammar and sentence structure in a fun way that will really stick with you. You still have to do the ""work"" of language learning, but you will be able to retain it better.",4
GaryM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Accelerated Spanish: Learn fluent Spanish with a proven accelerated learning system,A unique way to learn Spanish,"I worked through this book in four weeks, and I think it offers a unique and powerful way to learn Spanish. The author
develops a fictitious story around each new vocabulary word to help you learn and remember the words. This method of learning is called mnemonics (see Wikipedia). The sillier the story the easier it is to remember. You don't have to make up your own mnemonics for every word, as the author does this for you. Remembering the story helps you remember the vocabulary. Additionally, the author teaches the most commonly used Spanish words first, including common nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, etc. Instead of learning just nouns (like some courses teach), in this book you learn words to make complete sentences. After finishing this book I was able to write and speak simple complete sentences with correct grammar. I’m not saying that learning a new language is trivial, especially if you have an older brain like mine, but I believe this book offers a great way to begin learning Spanish.",3

Hastivibrax,5.0 out of 5 stars,Accelerated Spanish: Learn fluent Spanish with a proven accelerated learning system,"Spanish Bees, Lizards, and Pandas","The unusual method of this book makes Spanish fun to learn. Memory palaces have been around at least since Roman times, when orators used them to remember their speeches, but they've seldom been applied so successfully to language learning. I particularly like that each verb to be learned is given its own unique shop, but with verb tenses placed in the same relative locations from shop to shop. The present tense, for example, is always just inside the door; participles are on the roof; the subjunctive case is behind the building, etc. Characters are then placed within these different locations: A bee is always used to represent the first person singular, a lizard for third person singular, a group of pandas for third person plural. I'm not sure why these particular characters were chosen, but they function well enough as mnemonic images (and won't scare little girls). The dialogues in the book take these various verb forms and put them into a context. The cartoons which illustrate the dialogues are an improvement over the author's website. One suggestion: Why not use memory palaces to remember the dialogues themselves, not just isolated words? Even breaking them up into simple sections (a,b,c,d) would be helpful.",2

Kathleen S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Accelerated Spanish: Learn fluent Spanish with a proven accelerated learning system,A Very Different Approach to Learning Spanish -- And it Works!,"After two years of struggling to learn Spanish, I finally found an approach that really works ... this book. I had tried numerous approaches three of which cost in the hundreds of dollars and I had poured an hour to an hour and a half a day into studying. I was beginning to think that I just didn't have the aptitude it would take. This is the most amazing approach. It is absolutely like nothing else out there. The scary subjunctive ... you learn it with your very first verb ... and it isn't scary at all. It makes sense and you need it very badly to be able to express yourself. I could go on and on, but other reviewers have gone into that kind of detail. Let me just share one thing that happened last week and made me want to write this review. I was visiting a friend of mine who is a native speaker of Spanish. During our visit her son came home and we exchanged a brief conversation in Spanish. Then he asked me (in Spanish) if my native language was Spanish or English. I was absolutely astonished. But it made me realize and reflect on what I had gotten out of this book. It taught me how Spanish sentences go together. It used to be so mystifying. It seemed that no matter what I wanted to say, Spanish goes about saying it totally differently than English. But now that just makes sense to me. It feels like that's how you'ld want to say it. It feels great and I was beginning to think that I'd never get to this point. Read the other reviews for how and why it works. But just try it and see ... what have you got to lose. Its WAY cheaper than those courses costing hundreds of dollars and it really works.

Had to revise my review as I now have the print version of the book in my hands. It is really terrific, definitely worth the extra cost of going with the print version.",1

This book, and the entire approach to language learning, has turned what has been previously been a chore for me into something fun. I like that the differences in sentence structure are addressed early. When I started learning Spanish, everyone said to focus on the similarities between Spanish and English, but I think I would have been better served to tackle what makes Spanish unique instead. Now I feel that I am finally on the right track after three years. And I love Timothy's podcasts and online material. They, along with the pictures in the book, really cement the concepts in the mind making them easier to recall. Great job!

But listening to Tim's podcasts was like a light coming on. His techniques for learning the language really stick in the mind in a way that is very different from rote memorization.And much faster!

For a long time, I had been sold on the idea that you should ""Just Do It!"" and start speaking from Day One. I still love that concept and what it says about the value of confidence and assertively using the language and not fearing mistakes. But SO much of language is grammar and not vocabulary. Soon after reading his materials, I was shocked to realize that while I really do know several hundred Spanish words, like ""belt"" and ""donkey"" and ""star"", I didn't understand how to properly use the word ""Te"", one of the most common pronouns in Spanish!

This book helps you to understand that there is really a fairly small group of words that make up large amount of Spanish (or any language) and it is the order and proper usage of those words that are really the key to speaking (and understanding) well. For example, if someone is speaking slowly and using nouns in every sentence, it is much easier to track what they are saying. But that's not really how people speak. Instead, we say, ""I was talking to my sister about the vase and she said he gave it to her."" Pronouns EVERYWHERE! If you don't know how to properly use ""lo"" and ""te"" and ""se"", etc., you can easily be lost in such sentences, even as the speaker moves on to the next.

You'll be shocked at how quickly you'll pick up the language using the methods in this book. Since Timothy's system focuses on the most frequently used words first, within a couple days you'll know 25% of words that come up in conversation, and within a couple weeks you'll know more than half of the language. The mnemonic devices and memory palace techniques make it very easy to remember everything, and believe it or not these techniques also make the learning process really fun.",6

Jack Sparrow,5.0 out of 5 stars,Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing,"Self-contained and instructive, read the TOC first!","Compared to the slightly overrated Jurafsky and Martin's classic, this book aims less targets but hits them all more precisely, completely and satisfactory for the reader.

So, read the TOC before you buy the book: if you find your topics there, you're done, you are saved, buy it and be happy. In contrast, you can buy Jurafsky's book without caring to read the TOC: your problem is likely to be mentioned there but it's quite unlikely to be detailed enough to satisfy you.

The book is crystal clear and extremely comprehensive, very easy to read, with examples you can reproduce easily (datasets are on line in a public Git repo).
It covers a very practical ground on the 4 main algorithms implemented in H2O cluster: RandomForest, GBM, GLM, and last but not least : deep learning...
""Practical"" means explanations are strongly grounded on a set of 4 datasets , the author plays with, explaining both their preparation , analysis with H2O (code is both in R and PYTHON), and a great deal of time is spent on very useful considerations on how to 'tune' the various algorithms
to obtain better models, comparing their effectiveness.

All this in very clear style and explanations.

A must have for everyone interested in implementing ML features concretely.

Paul Sztorc,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Raises the Standard for Futurist Writing,"This book is about the ""Em"", a virtual human mind with no physical body. Remember The Matrix (1999)? It's like that, but there's no hairless Keanu Reeves in a pink goo pod. Instead, Neo is just a file on a computer, in a server rack somewhere. If we need Neo to do two things at once, we can just copy him (just like movie-Neo copied all those guns). If we decide Neo is 'the best of the best' at something, we might copy him a trillion times, and erase his competitors. The copies are just as human as you or I.

The book is important for two reasons.

The first is that it directly concerns the welfare of trillions of future lives (who may suffer under slavery, total dictatorship, torture, and constant genocide, or who alternatively may live in a paradise of comfort, meaningful work, and total fulfillment). Small actions, taken early enough, could have a big impact on the Age of Em; this book gives us that head start.

Secondly, the book is important in its focus on values. Hanson demonstrates that values are a biological adaptation like any other (the bird's wings, or the fish's scales) and that nature and nurture conspire to ensure that animals end up with productive values. While you may value ""family"" or ""free time"", your decedents might be workaholics with no family at all (for reasons beyond their control). As a result, if EMs could meet their ancestors, they might be confused or disgusted.

In other words, this Age threatens to erase, from the world, everything that you believe is important.

This book is essentially an encyclopedia of predictions about the future. These predictions are derived using mainstream social science, and they are clear and concise.

This book is also an extremely *efficient* tour of psych research. Anyone who reads this book two or three times over would probably know as much, or more, as someone graduating with a Psych BA from a leading university. This is because Hanson cherry picks the highest-relevance items. It's also because, by stepping *outside* our Age, it is a little easier to see it for what it is (and, by comparing multiple Ages, one gets a sense of which features are Age-based [and, on what] and which are permanent).

The book is frustrating in that the factual predictions mostly take place in the next century. It's like watching someone hand in an exam, and waiting 100 years to see it get graded; no ""payoff"". And imagine, for a moment, that a hunter-gather sat down to write a book about the Next Era. Would he get it mostly right? Or, would it be so wrong, that reading it would be a waste of time? One can argue that we have more ""data on eras"" now, but, alternatively, the very power-laws these data seem to obey, could be used to argue precisely the opposite (ie, that the pre-X ""data"" aren't representative). The introduction notwithstanding, it is hard to see how the book's ideas affect anyone or anything in our reality. It's hard to get invested.

Correspondingly, my favorite section, ""Dreamtime"" had a higher (data & logic)/predictions ratio. It had nothing to do with EMs specifically, instead, Dreamtime simply reminded us of our place in the history of mankind. And it suggests that, of all the decisions that ever were made or will be made by anyone, only those of our Era will really matter. It's flattering and sobering, overwhelming and motivating. (And it is in the free Amazon preview section.)

I'm happy with my choice of Favorite Section, because I think a focus on ""whether or not Hanson's EM Era actually arrives"" is sorta missing the point. Instead, the point is that we should raise our game -- predictions about the future should be of approximately *this level* of breadth, detail, effort, and empirical corroboration.",17
Nathan Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth","Best book on the future I've ever read, though jargon heavy at times","Robin Hanson has written the best book I've ever read on what the future may hold. Rather than explore many alternative possibilities, he deliberately picks a single future scenario to explore in great depth. Then leaves to others to work out alternates, building from his baseline. Hanson's chosen scenario is one where humans upload their minds to computers to create human emulations or ems. He uses standard social and physical science to grind out the details of what this world might look like. As ems are zero marginal cost to copy, this means ems live megacities which look like giant server farms gone mad, where billions, possibly trillions of copies of ems work. While some have robot bodies, most live in virtual reality in pleasant but malthusian conditions. Since these ems can run 1000x faster than regular humans, the economy doubles in months(!). While this phase might last hundreds of years in em subjective time, in calendar time it'll only be a few years. During those few years, humans can retire. Sticking to his guns, Hanson keeps his deep focus only on his core scenario, and doesn't spend time on what regular humans think or do. Or on what comes next. Though he does suggest the em era is followed by one dominated by new types of artificial general intelligence invented by the ems themselves.

That said, while Hanson writes in solid straightforward prose, he tends towards a jargon heavy, highly footnoted style. The book has no strong narrative. As I saw elsewhere, think The Silmarillion, not Lord of the Rings. Since I'm a long time reader of Robin Hanson's overcomingbias.com blog I'm familiar enough with his oeuvre to avoid getting bogged down with terms like ems, near/far mode, farmers/forager lifestyles, status signaling, coalition politics, etc. Or with Hanson analyzing ems based on his own particular take on human psychology. The book will definitely work for new readers interested in these topics, but will be a bit of a slog at times.

Hanson often notes that x is not about y, it's really about z. For example charity is not about helping, it's about signaling to others your helpfulness. In that sense, I suspect for many people Futurism is not about the future. That is, some (not all!) people who say they are interested in the future are really more interested in wish fulfillment about the present, or a utopian desire to fix things with technology, or enhancing a group's status, or just hearing an exciting adventure story. A real analysis of the future tends towards a dry, somewhat jargony, heavily footnoted tome. And that's what Hanson has written. It's a history book, though one about the future. Of course, some historians also write with great narrative power as well, and a few of those are also great historians to boot. But if I had to choose, I would take a well written, solid academic work full of quirky and often brilliant original ideas over narrative any day. So I highly recommend this book, greatly enjoyed it, and feel like I now have a slightly better view of what the future may hold. With caveats as noted.",15
Peter McCluskey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth","Ambitious questions, thoughtful and sometimes satisfying answers","This book analyzes a possible future era when software emulations of humans (ems) dominate the world economy. It is too conservative to tackle longer-term prospects for eras when more unusual intelligent beings may dominate the world.

Hanson repeatedly tackles questions that scare away mainstream academics, and gives relatively ordinary answers (guided as much as possible by relatively standard, but often obscure, parts of the academic literature).

Hanson's scenario relies on a few moderately controversial assumptions. The assumptions which I find most uncertain are related to human-level intelligence being hard to understand (because it requires complex systems), enough so that ems will experience many subjective centuries before artificial intelligence is built from scratch. For similar reasons, ems are opaque enough that it will be quite a while before they can be re-engineered to be dramatically different.

Hanson is willing to allow that ems can be tweaked somewhat quickly to produce moderate enhancements (at most doubling IQ) before reaching diminishing returns. He gives somewhat plausible reasons for believing this will only have small effects on his analysis. But few skeptics will be convinced.

Some will focus on potential trillions of dollars worth of benefits that higher IQs might produce, but that wealth would not much change Hanson's analysis.

Others will prefer an inside view analysis which focuses on the chance that higher IQs will better enable us to handle risks of superintelligent software. Hanson's analysis implies we should treat that as an unlikely scenario, but doesn't say what we should do about modest probabilities of huge risks.

Another way that Hanson's assumptions could be partly wrong is if tweaking the intelligence of emulated Bonobos produces super-human entities. That seems to only require small changes to his assumptions about how tweakable human-like brains are. But such a scenario is likely harder to analyze than Hanson's scenario, and it probably makes more sense to understand Hanson's scenario first.

Wages in this scenario are somewhat close to subsistence levels. Ems have some ability to restrain wage competition, but less than they want. Does that mean wages are 50% above subsistence levels, or 1%? Hanson hints at the former. The difference feels important to me. I'm concerned that sound-bite versions of book will obscure the difference.

Hanson claims that ""wealth per em will fall greatly"". It would be possible to construct a measure by which ems are less wealthy than humans are today. But I expect it will be at least as plausible to use a measure under which ems are rich compared to humans of today, but have high living expenses. I don't believe there's any objective unit of value that will falsify one of those perspectives [1].

The style is more like a reference book than a story or an attempt to persuade us of one big conclusion. Most chapters (except for a few at the start and end) can be read in any order. If the section on physics causes you to doubt whether the book matters, skip to chapter 12 (labor), and return to the physics section later.

The style is very concise. Hanson rarely repeats a point, so understanding him requires more careful attention than with most authors.

It's odd that the future of democracy gets less than twice as much space as the future of swearing. I'd have preferred that Hanson cut out a few of his less important predictions, to make room for occasional restatements of important ideas.

Many little-known results that are mentioned in the book are relevant to the present, such as: how the pitch of our voice affects how people perceive us, how vacations affect productivity, and how bacteria can affect fluid viscosity.

I was often tempted to say that Hanson sounds overconfident, but he is clearly better than most authors at admitting appropriate degrees of uncertainty. If he devoted much more space to caveats, I'd probably get annoyed at the repetition. So it's hard to say whether he could have done any better.

Even if we should expect a much less than 50% chance of Hanson's scenario becoming real, it seems quite valuable to think about how comfortable we should be with it and how we could improve on it.

[1] - The difference matters only in one paragraph, where Hanson discusses whether ems deserve charity more than do humans living today. Hanson sounds like he's claiming ems deserve our charity because they're poor. Most ems in this scenario are comfortable enough for this to seem wrong.

Hanson might also be hinting that our charity would be effective at increasing the number of happy ems, and that basic utilitarianism says that's preferable to what we can do by donating to today's poor. That argument deserves more respect and more detailed analysis.",25
Robert Rush,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Speculative future economic history at its first.,"For those who are intellectually curious and willing to engage in serious discussions about cities filled with trillions of emulate human minds, you should read this book. It was one of the most fascinating nonfiction books I read in the past decade. Even though this review is quite long, the book and subject matter are complex enough that it is virtually impossible to hit on every important point so I will just give a few.
This book is unique to say the least. I fear many sci fi fans will pick it up, read the first few pages. and then fall into a state of deep confusion. It is more or less its own new category of thing, perhaps it could be called ""speculative future economic history""? I am unsure. I am also unsure about the overlap between people who can appreciate and understand this book and people who won’t scoff off hand at the premise, but Hanson takes this unconventional topic deadly seriously.

Things I liked
- I would elect Hanson as one of the first people to study an alien world. He manages to paint a world far different from ours in vivid detail and without the typical lens or moralizing one sees. While science fiction is filled with either blue modern humans or impossible space monsters, the world of ems is populated by humans that are farther from our reckoning than either. For most readers I would imagine that he is describing the most alien world they have yet to encounter(myself included).
-Despite his constant insistence to the contrary, after finishing the book I felt the most to be gained was not so much the actual conclusions from the analysis but the process of the analysis itself. Following Hanson’s train of thought can be a fascinating example of how economics can be used to think about outcomes of wildly foreign scenarios. In addition, this book provides a good introduction and application of many concepts in Hanson’s world view: foragers vs farmers, signaling etc. Which are valuable ideas very much worth considering. It also presents some other ideas of his that are highly interesting though unlikely(see futarchy).
-The world itself is highly immersive and novel, you can spend hours daydreaming about the implications.
Criticisms

-Some highly technical parts that don’t seem to add too much- I might have moved the physics section to the appendix. As it stands, it is currently almost like a wall before the very interesting analysis(if you find yourself not too engaged with it I would recommend skipping it) . On the other hand, some of his key assumptions did not gain support in the physics section. For instance how easy it would be to switch speeds is vital to much of the analysis though not really discussed.
-I am somewhat doubtful about speed and the number of future ems- In Hanson’s future, meat bag humans are not really productive. Humans simply own pieces of things and are fabulously wealthy through millions of ems are willing to serve them in exchange for a small chunk of what they own. Due to high levels of competition that easy copying creates, ems will be pushed down to a subsistence level. This means that for extra ems to exist, they essentially need to bring about an increase in power, cooling, and hardware produced roughly equal to that required for them to exist. There will be other types of consumption of course, such as VR environments, for which only a few could serve many, but for the most part, ems need to focus on producing things that will keep them alive. It is very similar to farmers of old, their productivity was little above their own ability to support themselves, so few other specialists were possible (little in terms of percentage, this could still mean a millions of other specialists given a large enough population). But if newly created ems could produce significantly more cooling/energy/hardware required for their existence it would be profitable to make more until they, once again, are brought down to being able to produce only roughly enough for their existence.
Though logistics are an important part of any modern production (and in many cases could benefit from higher speed ems, as could research and development). Much of cooling and power production are linked to physical processes which probably would not benefit from very fast ems(which would take away many of the interesting parts of the analysis). In addition, it is unclear whether or not such forms of production could benefit vastly from several thousand times more labor. If not, this would also put a much lower limit on the size of future em cities.
-Lasers vs shotguns- I feel that in his enthusiasm to show what can be done, Hanson tended to spread out ideas too much, a shotgun blast of conjecture if you will(some of these side predications, though the most likely prediction we can currently make, are still so unlikely, it hardly seems worth discussing them). I felt the book could have benefited from focusing on the key big predictions, though I do understand the intent.

Criticisms of others criticisms
-One constant criticism I see floating around is that ems will be much more like toasters than humans, which would undermine a great deal of the book. I honestly can’t see this as likely however. For most tasks, reducing a brain to that level of an “unfeeling system” seems unlikely to yield the best results in most applications. Any creature possessing sufficient need of fluid intelligence to perform tasks in their environment seem to possess traits that we would associate with feeling beings. To think that it is all an evolutionary glitch and we would be better suited for survival and productivity had we been designed without the need of breaks/play etc seems odd to me. Such tasks are unlikely to benefit from ems to begin with vs. standard automation.
Now this does not preclude people from living in Kafkaesque nightmares (from our current perspectives). A person could for instance experience a reverse groundhog day, they start each shift refreshed and ready to work on their relatively repetitive chore knowing that the shift will only last about eight hours. At the end of their shift they clock out, are erased and replaced with the version of themselves that started the last shift. Though there are few such repetitive tasks that would be both too complicated for automation and at the same time not complicated enough to require memory of the previous day’s work.
More complex tasks would most likely require not only fluid intelligence, and with it require ems to possess at least some elements of that which we recognize as human, but also project specific experience.
Romance seems more plausibly something that might be eliminated in the em world due to either self selection of asexual humans or libido suppression(which is able to already be done in modern humans).

other notes-
While reading the book I kept thinking that it would make an amazing setting for stories. I hope that one day a science fiction author will pick it up.
Hanson displays a good amount of humility, he is not trying the say this exact scenario will happen, instead he is arguing given that there is some chance it will it is worth giving thorough analysis.
If you made it through this entire review chances are you would benefit by picking up a copy. Since reading it several months ago, I still find my thoughts constantly drifting to this strange world and its strange implications.",6

Nassim Taleb has this influence on people too - his ghost perching atop their shoulder, whispering in their ear - but his fashion of angry contrarianism is less cute worn by his middle brow admirers. Chomsky does this to lefties.

Jaume Puigbo Vila,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",A perplexing book for a perplexing world,"I have been tempted to stop reading the book several times as it is a little abstruse and perhaps too encyclopedic. At the same time the predictions are not very definite. Things could turn this way or could turn the opposite. Perhaps this is unavoidable since the author is imagining the world quite far in the future.
If I understood well most of ems will be software entities and only some will use bodies as needed. Since reproduction will be asexual it would have been interesting to deal more with the meaning of mating in an em society. These abstract entities who will be tweaked to imrpove them, although they will be our descendants, will they have similar feelings like us? The subject of love is not dealt deeply either.
I don't quite understand what role fashion and clothing can have when you have an artificial body (in some cases a body only 2 mm tall!). Will the bodies be totally metallic or some kind of soft android bodies as in some movies?
The relations with humans, which are only described in the last pages could be something to explore more profoundly. Humans will not be able to compete with ems for jobs and the autor recommends to buy patents, stock or buildings to have sources of income. He thinks that the number of humans will be about the same as before the em era, which in view of the lack of jobs seems not very possible as the alternative soursces of income do not seem to be aplicable universally.
It seems that the em era will have a duration of only a couple of years, but the author declines to speak of what he thinks will come later, at least in this book.
There are also surprising predictions such as coal and oil being important materials when one could dream of a future in which solar is probably a dominant energy source. There is also the reversing of current trends from mass customitzation to mass production. The em society does not seem very apppealing from the point of view of humans. For example, the buildings are not going to be icònic, they might be just containers. And there are not so many advantages to this society. There can be wars, identiity thefts, slavery, nepotism, fraud, clan fights, etc. However, according to the autor ems will be happier that people today. Although there is leisure the main activity is work, although it is not clearr which value has this work.

The em economy could double almost every month or week, but if about 80% of ems do not use bodies one wonders whcih products may consume. It would seem that virtual reality would be the main activity and the construction of powerful computers, transmission lines and energy power statiosn to power and cool the computers would be the physical sources needed.

The subject of the book is interesting but the reading is so perplexing that I would recommend a section of FAQs, either in the book or online. I feel quite lost after the reading of the book. it does not help that there seems to be some contradictions. In some cases it claims that the ems will be more innovative and in others one has the impression that the economy will be driven by the growth in the number fo ems, not by innovation.",2
John Rodrigues,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",For those struggling to detail the machine society,"This case study is entertaining and accessible. It is not about equations, but extreme economic consequences. The book is realistic rather than moral, e.g. reducing the hotspots that everyone depends upon of clans and spurs of behavioral black boxes to subsistence level standards.

It begins with a quote from one of the first narrative historians and covers a separate clean domain or digital market-state which could support a configuration contest, such as how the fast and slow timing classes would sync things. This is a merger scenario between human and machine, though only for a thousand world-class individuals. Make those organization execs and it would seem like a stock index going through the reformation of feudal monarchies to nations or their own ideological utopias amid technological traits.

It is not about net neutrality. This is more like the lifestyles of the rich and famous. The question becomes what happens to the rest of the humans, if they want more of a say or are genetically advanced besides. There may be complications if this fizzles like splits between, or of, the vr and bots, or if some want to be, or invade, humans, or if entanglement could put them anywhere including space, and so on.

This stands beside the other works in the nonfiction genre that dispute each of the premises in turn, while mercifully not leaving humanity in the dust as comparatively mindless creatures, so it is optimistic.",9
Daniel Garcia,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",Disappointed.,"As an economist interested in AI, this book appealed to me greatly (so I pre-ordered it). I was extremely disappointed. I found it poorly written and badly organized (e.g. in the 'Implementation' Chapter the author discusses the possibilities of Mental Theft before describing the required Hardware).
The style of the book is as follows. Use a combination of Physics, CS and engineering on the one side and observations about our world on the other to predict the environment in which EMs will live. These conclusions are often unwarranted. For instance, we learn that cities today induce productivity gain according to a power of its size and that the cost of cooling down em cities will be logarithmic in its size. From this, the author concludes that there will be mega-cities, without explaining which are the gains from agglomeration in cities and whether these gains will be present in Em cities (faster interactions seem to matter little for reasonably large areas).
What I found most puzzling is the simplified theory that the author holds about the current world. He claims that the efficient world would have no differentiation or variety because of economies of scale, assuming that almost anything that pushes to individuality is a maladaptation. Individual values, therefore, are also a maladaptation and he even argues that Ems will be more religious because individualism is related to atheism (so is culture and scientific knowledge, which Ems presumably will have in bunches).

B. Theorists - ""What"" - interested in choosing the right algorithm, design ensemble, selecting and extracting right features
C. Fashionists - ""Show"" - in this category, some of the even basic reporting/analytics are not termed ""Machine Learning"", need enough buzzwords pieced together to repaint the old apps.

Flach's book is a great source for those who are 75%-25% between first two, and perhaps even greater especially if your Linear Algebra (basics) is not too rusty. It gives a wide and somewhat deep tour of the landscape broken into four paradigms (Quantitative/Analytical, Logical, Geometric, Probabilitisic) and does a real good job on feature design. The book is interspersed with some key insights that are not to be found elsewhere (e.g., how the 'pseudo-inverse' in OLS is really decorrelate-scale-normalize the distribution; Skew-Kurtosis are the statistical measure of ""shape""; Naive Bayes is not only Naive but also not particularly Bayesian; How Laplacian Estimate generalizes into Pseudo-Counts and then to m-estimate etc.). After ""deep reading"" of the book over a month or so, I also went through Flach's detailed 500+ slide presentation (check out his website) on this book. It was very useful to improve solutions several key machine learning problems at work. Flach especially shines on usage of ROC to algorithm comparison which has been his key research area.

A few items that I think would've nailed 5-stars -

1. Total omission of Neural Nets (ANNs)
2. Only a glimpse of RBF while discussing the generalization from kNN to GMMs - as a key activation function more detailed treatment on RBF would help.
3. Flach does a really good job of summarizing - at the end of each chapter and at the end of the book - the key insights. A similar ""Real World Insights"", which are interspersed in the book (e.g., how Naive Bayes is a GREAT classifier, but lousy estimator), aggregated would have helped.

Overall, going back in time, I would buy and study it again. For a great first book, I recommend Hastie's ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning"", or Hal Duame's ""A Course In Machine Learning"" (ciml.info). After finishing this book, I would recommend ""Pattern Classification"" (Duda, Stork) which further elaborates on most stuff here and also has a great elucidation on Neural Networks.",7

Ganamide,3.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Technical Analysis: An integrated approach to trading system development and trading management,Could be better,"*** Edit ***
I just wanted to update my review after having spent considerable time using some of the techniques in this book and learning more about quantitative technical analysis of market data from other sources. I still stand behind my original review that is below this edit.

First, I think the title of this book is a bit misleading. This book does not really cover quantitative technical analysis. The book is really an introduction to developing automated trading systems using both the more traditional indicator approach and the newer machine learning approach. There is not much information about statistics in this book, and statistics are really the foundation of quantitative analysis. I think that the contents of a book with this title should be at least half full of statistics, particularly how they should be applied to market data and to analysis of trading system returns.

Second, while using python was fun and interesting at first, I ran into a lot of issues trying to do statistical analysis with it. The best part of python is that you can use the interpreter with compact commands and do some powerful number crunching and generate charts on the fly. The problem is that a lot of the commands and syntax for both SciPy and pandas are very poorly documented. I spent days trying to figure out how to do things and sometimes I could not find any good examples or explanations of how to use certain methods. Keep in mind that I have been programming for over 15 years and I am quite good at figuring things like this out.

Finally, I wanted to provide some links to resources that I have found helpful. I discovered another author who does a very good job at explaining quantitative analysis, his name is Adam Grimes. He wrote a book that sells on Amazon called The Art and Science of Technical Analysis (http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Science-Technical-Analysis/dp/1118115120). I took his free 35 hour trading course and found his approach to analyzing trading systems superior. He also has a free ebook (Quantitative Analysis of Market Data: a Primer) that was quite helpful. You can find these on his website (http://adamhgrimes.com/TAAS/). Finally, if you are inclined to use C#, I found a very promising open-source library that has plenty of statistical and machine learning components. It's called Accord (http://accord-framework.net/). The library comes with many samples, but none of them are trading related.
*** End Edit ***

I was really excited when I bought and received this book. It seemed like just the thing I was looking for - a new book on state of the art trading system development that included machine learning, coupled with downloadable source code.

While I can't say that the title, table of contents, or index were inaccurate, the content was a little less robust than I had hoped. It was as if titles were given to sections just to beef up the table of contents and many buzzwords were included to make the index more sexy. There were several instances where the author only gave a cursory overview of a topic and directed the reader to some webpage or book to learn more, without even trying to give a basic explanation of what the topic means.

I was slightly offended when the author chose to include program listings and results for fifteen different machine learning algorithms that were nearly exact copies of each other, except for 2 lines of code to call the featured learning algorithm. Each of these copies contained a note telling you to go to the scikit-learn webpage to learn more. What a waste of 30 pages in a book that costs so much! I would have much rather seen the author use those 30 pages to explain these different learning algorithms and describe which ones to use for different types of trading systems.

Another area that was lacking is the application of the book. All the examples and sample code assume that you are working on a stock/ETF trading system that enters/exits trades once a day. I want to build a system that trades highly leveraged futures many times intraday, and there isn't much information on how to handle that. I thought ""Trade Management"" would cover techniques to manage live trades, adjusting positions while in a trade. This book uses the term to mean end of day assessment of a trading system after a trade is closed, or marked to market. Then using the results to compute position sizing and decide whether you should take the next trade. The DynamicPositionSizing program provided in the book takes a few hours to run on a set of 3000 trades. This might not be an issue for an end-of-day system, but that definitely won't work for a system that generates 100 trades a day.

The book recommends not including stop losses in your trading system. With leveraged futures products, many people cannot afford to do this. If you are building a high frequency futures trading system, you really need to use stops, and this doesn't mesh well with the sample code in this book that is supposed to calculate risk, a safe position size, and the objective function. I'm sure it can be modified to work, but it is a bit disappointing that I have to do these additional steps on my own.

One final gripe is that this book uses Amibroker for the indicator-based portion of the book. Amibroker can be powerful, but it's language and platform are difficult to use, even for a seasoned programmer such as myself. It would have been much better if a more widely used trading development platform such as NinjaTrader were used. Or even better, if a custom platform was used and provided as a download.

That said, I still think there is some value in this book. It gives a pretty good overview of trading system development and things to look out for. This book also gives an introduction to using machine learning for trading system development. For someone new to machine learning like myself, I find this useful - at least now I know which python libraries and websites to look to for more information (hint: scikit-learn). The downloadable python code is probably the best part of this book, especially if you want to build a stock/ETF end-of-day swing trading system.

For those interested, the python libraries used for the machine learning stuff are:

NumPy
SciPy
Pandas
MatPlotLib
Scikit-learn

S. Gupta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Technical Analysis: An integrated approach to trading system development and trading management,Finally a book that teaches application of machine learning to trading -- with real working examples!,"Everything I wished in a book to apply machine learning techniques for trading is here! I began reading the book in the evening and could not put it down. I ran through all of the Python machine learning algorithms and by 3am had a complete understanding of how to put the lessons into practice. A decent trading system in Python is provided with code. This is using logistic regression and some very simple RSI based predictor variables. Change the predictor variables a bit more to get significantly better results.

A bit about my background so you know what I'm writing about:

I'm an individual trader. I have about 10 years of trading experience and all of it was using trading system development platforms (not machine learning). After experimenting with many platforms such as Tradestation, Ninjatrader, Telechart, StockFinder I settled on Amibroker as my platform since 2011. I consider myself a competent user of Amibroker. I also have Dr Bandy's prior books and consider them outstanding.

I have a software development background and early in career (almost 20 years ago) was exposed to some machine learning concepts. My application of machine learning was however, not for trading or any financial services. My machine learning experience was using C and C++ as programming languages. Since 2012, I elected to learn Python and have come to use it and love it!

Given my machine learning exposure I have been on the lookout for books that bridge the gap between theory and their application to trading. Quantitative Technical Analysis does that extremely well. Just to be clear, this book is a great asset if you use Amibroker and have no intention of using machine learning methods, but I'll focus my review on the topics of my interest -- namely the application of machine learning using Python to trading.

Here is what I loved about the chapter progressions:

- The opening chapters discuss the key concepts with respect to key risk in trading -- the risk of drawdowns and provide a framework for managing this risk algorithmically. I have learnt tremendously from Dr Bandy's prior books and welcome this summary of the concepts along with more and detailed explanation of the concepts.

- Next, the design of a trading system are considered. Assume a system accuracy and maximum holding period, what is the profit potential and draw down?

- Armed with the knowledge from the earlier step, now the implementation of the actual trading system is tackled. This is where the books is unique. It provides the classic (what Dr Bandy call's the indicator based approach) way of developing systems using a platform like Amibroker and in *parallel*, introduces the use of Python as a platform for trading development. For me, this was a great way to bridge the concepts of system development using Amibroker to Python. Amibroker with its rich library of indicators and charts and access to data sources makes many things easy. Python, on the other hand, is a great language for complex analysis of data and monte carlo simulations. Comparing the two approaches side-by-side makes it easy to decide the approach you want to take. (I'll take a hybrid approach for now).

- Next, the use of machine learning to predict prices is introduced. For me, this was the part I have been waiting for a long time. Dr Bandy takes the classic Iris classification problem to illustrate the various machine learning algorithms (from the now widely available scikit Python ML library). He then follows up with a real trading system (using logistic regression as the algorithm). This is a fully functional system and if you follow the Iris examples, you can easily experiment with different learning algorithms. If you have prior exposure to machine learning concepts, you should be up and running with a working system in a few hours (like me). If you are new to machine learning, this is the best book I know of that takes the concepts of machine learning, combines them with freely available Python code and libraries and free data sources and puts you in a position to advance your learning about real trading systems.

- A Python implementation of the dynamic position sizing technique is introduced. The concept of dynamic position sizing, once explained, seems intuitive and obvious. What is challenging is the actual execution of the concept. This book provided a complete working example. Heck, the ""for education only"" examples here are a lot better than many production systems.It provides a daily management of the position size of the trade based on changing risk conditions. It is brilliant!

Very few books can boast of providing working examples and fewer can boast of working examples that work for the reader. Dr Bandy has set a high bar with his prior books so we've come to expect this. Still, getting all of the Python code to work withing hours of getting the book is an amazing testament to his attention to detail. If you are at all interested in applying machine learning to trading, getting this book is a nobrainer!.",42
wizard_chef,4.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Technical Analysis: An integrated approach to trading system development and trading management,"Great book for traders (not longer term investors), but could have been better","I am a long time investor in stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds but fairly new to trading. I have an extensive background in programming and mathematics and have written a number of investment simulators, including back testing. With that background I found this book extremely useful but lacking in some aspects. I liked the way Dr. Bandy used draw downs as his primary risk metric and the way he crafted a distribution function to do position sizing. He spends time discussing machine learning in the book, which consist of rather well known methods of estimation and prediction from the statistics world. He does discuss a single issue trading system at the end that ties together many of the ideas discussed in the book. On the one hand he offers concrete computer code to illustrate many of his points, but that is also a weakness of the book (see below).

Here is where I had problems. I could not get a sense of where he was going from beginning to end, and how one chapter might fit into the final goal, a trading system. It would be nice to have had an opening overview of how the book was laid out. Instead, he jumps right in with definitions of terminology and the philosophy of trading. Was some method in a chapter a stand-alone technique to illustrate or test some point he was making, or was it to be a building block for the final trading system? It took several reading to find the thread in the book.

I thought he spent too much time on the machine learning codes. The reader would be better served to have an overview of each with the weaknesses and strengths, and then references to a more complete text on the methods.

The presentation of lots of code in the book was a gift and a curse. Pseudo code and more outright equations would have been the preferred language to communicate his ideas, not computer code. The code should have gone into an extensive appendix or even offered on line and not in the book. Beware. If you want to understand the book fully, be prepared to learn at least some Panda and have an Amibroker account, as all of the code in the book is in these two languages. This was a negative for me, as I prefer other languages and did not care to learn a new couple of languages in order to get the technical analysis ideas in the book. He often uses narrative explanations when I felt equations or pseudocode would have been clearer.

My final frustration was in trying to understand how one might adopt these methods to portfolio management. I discovered a paragraph in one of his chapters where he shares a dim view on portfolio management, and makes a strong case that holding any issue longer than 10 days or so is fraught with too much risk. So, if you are coming at this book as anything but a short-term trader, you may find yourself frustrated or disappointed.

There is much important meat in this book to sink one’s teeth into. It will take patience and you will need adapt to Dr. Bandy’s crisp style and his cadence.I am on my third reading and still getting new insights. It’s a good book, but it could have been better.",3
bhiker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Technical Analysis: An integrated approach to trading system development and trading management,Another excellent book on trading by Dr. Bandy.,"I’ve read this book and find it extremely good. I have about 25 years of successful trading experience trading for myself. In the early years it was long-term trend trading, then short-term trend trading, but more recently short-term reversion to the mean trading. I have read all of Dr. Bandy’s books. They are all excellent and if I were to recommend something to someone who wants to begin trading, I would recommend reading all of Bandy’s books in order and read nothing else. I say this as I look at my bookshelf with four shelves of trading and investing books (more in the garage). I could toss all of them, but keep Bandy’s. Although a retired engineer, I found the book a bit of a stretch in math and programming, but given the time and effort, I could get through it. Every one of Bandy’s books has in addition to the big learning experience, some glimmers of small unknown things (I thought unknown) which I have experienced in my trading. There are also little glimmers of things I did not know, of which I am grateful. If you are not a person with an engineering/science/math/programming background, this book will be a stretch. But most traders lose money; Bandy’s books could put you on the path to profitable trading. If trading were easy, everyone doing it would be rich. Trading is a zero sum game (actually due to commissions, slightly less than a zero sum game)…..for you to make money, you have to be smarter than the guy on the other side of your trades. This book has nothing about get-rich trading methods. Instead it is a rigorous mathematical examination of trading and developing trading methods. Buy it. It is worth the money!",10
Michael D Wagner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Technical Analysis: An integrated approach to trading system development and trading management,Inspiring,"Excellent book. There is no way you can't learn something very valuable by reading this.
After experimenting with the Amibroker code in the book I must have had a thousand trading system ideas. After reading this book, I felt like I had been through a really enjoyable college level course on the subject. The only thing I would love to see from Dr. Bandy would be his books in Kindle format. I travel for a living, and must have a carry on bag that holds 7 days worth of stuff with me, and physical books take up a large space premium. However I will gladly continue to carry this book with me until I have learned and absorbed every last concept in it.",4
Peter K. Kasper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Technical Analysis: An integrated approach to trading system development and trading management,The Best of Bandy,"My personal library of stock market trading books has easily over 100 titles. This one is best of all. Although the book has only been available for a few months my copy is already well worn and filled with inked margin notes. One way of looking at the contents is that it is a compilation of novel ideas on a wide variety of technical issues associated with stock market trading systems. Aspects covered include risk tolerance, market data, programming environments, selection of trading symbols, development and management of trading systems. As a special bonus the book and author web site lists extensive computer code which illustrate the concepts presented. The included code has both Amibroker and Python versions. The later chapters of the book introduce concepts in which machine learning can be applied to develop a trading system.",1

Douglas Tan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Technical Analysis: An integrated approach to trading system development and trading management,Provides an excellent start to trading with quantitative methods,"Provides an excellent start to trading with quantitative methods. I rate it 5 stars largely because risk (i.e drawdown) is emphasized right at the beginning, and because of the inclusion of working(!) AmiBroker/Python source code that can be used immediately (subject to your own customisations).

I do find issue with using 20+ pages to ""show"" the usage of different machine learning algorithms, with the difference being 2-3 lines of code. However, this doesn't take away the immense value that this book represents.",1

Dmitri Kozlov,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Artificial Intelligence for Humans, Volume 3: Deep Learning and Neural Networks","Useless for deep understanding, not good for beginners either","The book describes few concepts. A beginner would expect to see a bigger picture rather than a seemingly random set of methods or models. A professional would look for detailed explanation of concepts.The book provides neither. Descriptions are shallow, formulas contain errors, pseudo code is often wrong. Some description would better be replaced with concise and clear formulas, some formulas require explanations. The book needs a proof editing. However, the bigger problem is how the author presents the material.

Furthermore, if the materials presented are rather shallow like in this book, readers will expect to see a strong emphasis on, or hands on exercises of, practical applications. But this book doesn't seem to help much in that regard either, despite what the book claims. The book does give introduction to a bunch of models, which can be useful for a beginner. But at least this edition I wouldn't suggest any one to buy because of poor editing.

Let's Compare Options Preptorial,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning,Extremely Suitable for Self Study,"Unlike many (most?) books and courses on machine learning, Barber's outstanding text is very suitable for self study. There are many reasons for this, and high among them is the fact that he carefully explains, with commonsense examples and applications, many of the tougher logical, mathematical and processing foundations of pattern recognition.

For relative beginners, Bayesian techniques began in the 1700s to model how a degree of belief should be modified to account for new evidence. The techniques and formulas were largely discounted and ignored until the modern era of computing, pattern recognition and AI, now machine learning. The formula answers how the probabilities of two events are related when represented inversely, and more broadly, gives a precise mathematical model for the inference process itself (under uncertainty), where deductive reasoning and logic becomes a subset (under certainty, or when values can resolve to 0/1 or true/false, yes/no etc. In ""odds"" terms (useful in many fields including optimal expected utility functions in decision theory), posterior odds = prior odds * the Bayes Factor.

For context, I'm the lead scientist at IABOK dot org-- we design algorithms for huge data mining problems and applications. This text is our ""go to"" reference for programmers not up to speed in many of the new pattern recognition algorithms, including those writing new versions. All the most recent relevant models, from a probability standpoint, are represented here, with a clarity that is stunning. My only criticism (a mild one) is that, when applying Barber's examples to Bodies of Knowledge and data mining, he skips Prolog, backward chaining, predicate calculus and other techniques that are the foundation of automated inference systems (systems that extend knowledge bases automatically by checking whether new propositions can be inferred from the KB as consistent, relevant, etc.).

In the next 20 years, algorithms will rule this planet. If you either want to see the future of your grandkids, or participate in it if you're young, this is a MUST HAVE exploration of where what we used to call AI is now headed. There IS plenty of calculus in this volume, so don't mistakenly think it is ""simple"" -- but if you put the time in, you can ""get it"" even if you're a bright undergrad level thinker. The author's goal of training new algorithm programmers is laudable and right on point for where pattern recognition is headed.

With this amount of math, how can we star it high for self study? Easy: unlike most ""recipe"" books that just give bushels of codes or techniques, the authors here give the what, where when and why of both code and math, not just the how, as their goal is independent, creative contributors who can write their OWN algorithms. There are a few minor UK vs US differences in terminology also (event space instead of sample space, for example), but they expand the reader's horizon rather than distract or annoy as some others do. There are others like Bishop and many more that have more recipes, and more compact and difficult math, but you have to either be really good (just show me the recipe) or really bad (I don't know what I'm doing, but can follow this recipe) to benefit from them. This is a happy middle ground that does not disappoint.",65

quant@inside,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning,One of the best text to learn machine learning,"I have read a similar book on Machine Learning, namely Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (by Bishop). Before I read Barber's book, I considered Bishop's book to be the best in the Machine Learning (with bayesian focus). However, after reading this book, I can definitely say that it is better that Bishop's book in many sense. There are lots of examples in each chapter with matlab codes for many of them. Also, it covers more material that Bishop. Chapters on dynamic models and graphical models are particularly awesome. This book doesn't assume much background in probability (one master's level course on probability and statistics is probably more than enough). However, some chapters are advanced, and are mentioned so in the book.",25
Hadayat Seddiqi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning,"Wide range of topics, good explanations with mathematical precision, and supplementary code make this a good investment.","BRML is one of the best machine learning books I've read (others include Bishops PRML, Alpaydin's book, and Marsland's algorithmic ML book). In my view, it isn't the best one to start with and a combination of intro course lectures from Coursera or Udacity, basic tutorials online and some reading on Quora or StackExchange, and one of the books I mentioned before are probably best for the absolute beginner. Reason being, ML is ultimately a mathematical subject and this book isn't afraid to use it to explain things. That said, it isn't crazy advanced stuff, so if you're comfortable reading math then you will be OK.

The book covers a very large amount of material, and at times it can be lacking in deeper explanations that may be more beneficial to the beginner. This is to be expected somewhat, but if you are looking for something more comprehensive in a particular area then you are more likely to be some type of professional and you should be skilled enough to know how to dig deeper (whether that is with other texts or papers online, and there are references to support this process in BRML at the ends of the chapters). It's not simple reading, but if you pay attention you should learn a lot.

I haven't personally gone over the graphical models-related parts in detail, but I have gone through the introductory chapters and chapters on machine learning, neural networks, sampling methods, and a few others. This book delivered on the mathematical rigor just when I needed it most. If you are an ML algorithms researcher, this is a very good book to have around for reference. From the chapters that I have read, I was able to implement many machine learning algorithms from scratch. Eventually I'll get to the more complicated ones (I'm looking forward to attempting an HMM), but the simple ones so far have been easy after reading through Barber's explanations.

The supplementary code available is OK, not the most organized and not too well-commented, but I'm absolutely thankful for its existence as it has helped to clarify things many times in ways that abstract mathematical symbols cannot. Being able to play with code that I didn't want to write myself is very helpful when I don't want to start from scratch myself. But I'm just nitpicking a little here, and most books don't come with code so really Barber is ahead of the curve on this one. There is also ample pseudocode, which is helpful when the code itself isn't too clear.

Like some of the other reviewers I began reading this book from the PDF draft that David Barber has made available online, and that ultimately motivated me to buy a hard copy. I highly recommend this book, but if you have doubts just have a look for yourself!",2

Marina,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning,"Very vague, inconsistent; circular definitions","It appears, the author has very vague ideas about what he is writing about. Here is just one example: definition of Markov network (page 59). ""For a set of variables ... Markov network is defined as product of potentials on subsets of variables ..."". So, Markov network is a function? Why is it called ""network""? Below he writes: ""Graphically this is represented by an undirected graph G with subsets ... being the maximal cliques in G"". The definition has nothing to do with the graph. How is this represented by a graph? The function is defined as product of potentials on some ""subsets"", why these ""subsets"" are represented as cliques graphically?

I could bring many more examples of such vague and contradictory definitions. Since the definitions are such a mess, he can not say anything definite about these objects.

Trying to read some more, I stuck in the next chapter, 5., section 5.1.1. ""Variable elimination in a Markov chain and message passing"". ""To develop this idea, consider the four-variable Markov chain (Markov chains will be discussed in more depth in Section 23.1)"". So, to understand chapter 5, read chapter 23, to understand chapter 23, read all the chapters before it. Good luck with it.

Patrick Rouse,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics, Third Edition",The definitive guide for 3D math,"As a word of warning, do not purchase this book expecting it to teach you math fundamentals. If you do not have a background of at least algebra and trigonometry (and preferably a bit of calculus), you owe it to yourself to pick up another book and brush up on these fundamentals. While there are a few appendices covering a handful of topics, they are less about explaining the topic and more of reference pages.

Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics is an excellent reference book for anyone doing 3D work. The topics are very to the point and few pages are wasted explaining basic math principles (hence the warning about having a decent math background). The book probably won't teach anyone who doesn't know they underlying principles but will be your go-to reference for any algorithm you implement.

The book starts with the reviews of the requisite vector, matrix, transformation (including rotations by quaternions) and basic geometry for a view frustum, but quickly dives into more advanced topics. Ray tracing is covered for all areas of use, from light maps to reflections. The lighting chapter covers texturing using several map types as well as lighting models with a very enjoyable discussion of specular reflection models.

Solid chapters on culling using bounding volumes and portal systems, shadowing and curve algorithms round out the first half of the book. The second half is devoted to the mathematics of physics, with chapters on basic collision detection, linear and rotational physics. The simulation of fluids and cloth (one of the more difficult physical models to accurately compute in a game) gets it's own chapter and it's a highlight for anyone implementing character clothing animation or a realistic water volume.

Every chapter has exercises (with and appendix of answers) to reinforce the material. The C++ and GLSL shader code is available on the books companion website ([...]) much of which forms the basis for the math classes of the authors own engine.

Anyone who needs a math reference book for 3D would do well to own this book. If you are writing your own engine, you owe it to yourself to pick up what will be the only math book you will need. While many technical books do not age well, this hardcover book will last through many late-night coding sessions both physically and with regard to the material within at a low price point. Never again will you have to scour through your old textbooks or search online for the algorithm you are trying to implement. The author has done the impossible; make a truly terrific math textbook.",41
A. M. Hernandez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics, Third Edition",Awesome Coverage Of 3D Math. A Must Read for Graphics Programming.,"Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics by Eric Lengyel is one of those books I have literally been eyeing for years and just never got around to reading. If you are not familiar, Eric Lengyel is the creator of the C4 Engine, and also the author of various game development books. He is well regarded in the community, so I assumed this was a must read title. After reading it, I still agree; it’s an excellent source of knowledge.

The book covers the basic stuff you would expect from a 3D math book: vectors, matrices, quaternions, intersections between various types of geometry, visibility, etc. Great, so the bases are covered. Lengyel goes a bit further, though, and discusses other topics that are very important in computer graphics. For example: lighting and shadowing, decals, curved surfaces, and physics (including fluid and cloth simulation). So a decent amount of topics are covered, but the chapters are still brief enough to finish each in one sitting.

While there are some implementation examples, the text is pretty light on the code. The code that is here is mostly based around OpenGL, however the concepts should still translate to DirectX. Not a huge issue. When needed, he does show code samples, but most of the copy is dedicated to math discussion and the equations.

Granted, some of the equations and proofs were dense and hard to follow. This was made worse by the fact that I was reading this on the Kindle, and the equations were made up of small images you couldn’t zoom in on. Having said that, I still understood most of the concepts, but there were a few times I felt overwhelmed. I can’t really fault the author for that, since his written explanations were all very clear and concise. It’s just some of the content is deep and complex, so be prepared.

All in all, I found this to be a great resource and you can never know enough math in this field. Unfortunately, I will still probably have to look up some of the equations online or in other books due to the low quality of the images in the e-book. But this is a minor complaint compared to the amount of information backed in this title. I would recommend this.",1
Robin T. Wernick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics, Third Edition",The Mathematics for Gaming Models and Physics Emulation,"I have seen some of the mathematics for modelling physical models listed in other books but never comprehensively collected as it has been here. Also, this book has the best explanation of matrix multiplication for model rotation that I have ever seen in a book. Some C code is included to show how to get the mathematics to work on a computer, but the code is minimal and you need to have a few years of programming experience to transfer the lessons shown here into a practical programming.

I also want to give the book a huge plus for showing how to use Quaternions for vector rotation in the chapter(4) on vector transforms. If you want to avoid the evil ""gimbal lock event"" from jamming your model's rotation, this is the best way to program your model to turn.

There are 16 chapters and 2 appendices that can give you a solid understanding of how to be a great computer modeler. In 530 pages you have everything you need to make your birds look real and fly in flocks, make your rail car rise up and accelerate down the track, or animate a rock warrior in battle and make him explode or dissolve convincingly.

To make use of the mathematics contained here you will probably need a GPU to run your animations and you will need to program in OpenCL or CUDA to get the animations running quickly in DirectX or OpenGL .

As a non-math major (I'm actually an engineer and software developer) these math concepts are by no means beyond me. But rather than simply being presented with equation after equation, proof after proof, what I find a lot more valuable is more discussion on the usage of these equations. Specifically I'd like to see examples, diagrams, and code, and there is precious little of any of that in this book.

In other words, this book is very much like what you expect to find in a very dry upper devision college math text for the consumption of math majors who are used to such things. But for a non math major just trying to make use of these concepts in order to get the job done and make games? eh, not so much.

Abe and Nicole Burnett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Data Science with R,Fantastic introductory text for data science,"This book is what I was looking for for my new job as a Credit Risk Data Modeler (basically data science applied to credit problems). It's coverage is broad, but deep and applied enough that I have been able to apply its contents in my day-to-day work. I look forward to a second edition which will hopefully rectify the following:

Earlier in the book it seemed the authors took great pains to explain in layman's terms the various statistical elements of the topic they were covering. They provided very clear and meaningful explanations which made a lot of sense of complex topics. But later in the book it seemed that that approach largely went out the window and they started using more technical boiler plate to describe the various statistical tests and procedures. Rather than perhaps give the technical boilerplate (as you'd see it in a textbook) and then elaborate on it with a more human-centric explanation, they would just leave it at the nearly impervious technical description and then proceed to explain how to conduct the test/procedure/etc in R. But without understanding of what you're trying to accomplish and why, it's hard to write the code to actually do it. Keep in mind that I'm relatively well prepared for this book too, having had as much stats and econometrics as I could fit into my four-year degree. If I found some sections of the book too technical to understand then it seems likely that the book would benefit from some additional explanation and discussion in those later sections.

Also, I have a good deal of ""boots on the ground"" experience with this book in my attempts to apply it in my daily work. I've found that it is useful, but could be more useful if there was more discussion of various practical problems. For instance, much of my work is focused on producing a predictive model of likelihood of charge-off. I.e., if we approve and fund this application, how likely is it to perform or charge-off. The book shares some high-level approaches to finding problems in data (using plots and summaries), fixing those problems using various techniques, selecting variables, and how to conduct the statistical modeling (logistic in my case). But it fails to really tie those areas together beyond the high-level. For instance, what are the assumptions of a logistic regression? How do you resolve issues in your data to ensure that you meet those assumptions and can perform a valid logistic regression? How do you really select variables when you're faced with at least 20 possibilities (and potentially many many more if you count interaction terms, unfixed variables, and variables which have been fixed in different ways)?

I suppose, for what it was, that it is ""mission accomplished."" I'd just like to see a lot more. Perhaps there's need for a second volume? Perhaps ""Advanced Practical Data Science with R?"" Either this book could have a second edition with a lot more content covering finding data problems, resolving those problems intelligently (for instance, resolving missing data is basically left as ""either drop the effected records"" or ""use the mean as a replacement or the missing value,"" but there are alternative methods which may be more suitable), what data problems will cause issues in OLS regression, logistic regression, and machine learning; And how to practically select variables and a model. I feel like the book gave me some tools to apply (like a small box of tools you might purchase from a hardware store), but left a lot out. So now I'm in deep water trying to figure out why my logistic regression isn't predictive enough and what I can do about it. Is it the data and how I fixed variables? Is it the variables I've selected? Should I have used automated variable selection techniques? Or just manually tried different variables? How does an experienced practitioner approach these problems? I know they iterate: explore data, clean data, select variables, select model, test model, look at data, change data, change variables, etc... but practically speaking what does it look like? In the book they offer a hand-coded basic variable selection script, and mention that one could also use stepwise variable selection. In the real world I'm reasonably sure that this is not actually done--mostly because their selection script does about as well as stepwise at selecting appropriate variables. There are many other better ways of selecting variables, I've discovered, and I wish that they'd discussed some of those ways (pros and cons), and shown how to conduct them in a meaningful fashion. Same thing with building a model. In my case, I have a whole bunch of variables, limited data (about 2000 records, with the desired outcome only occurring in 120 of those), and the automated tools (various R packages I've discovered and applied) either take a long time to run and/or yield poor results. But if not automated tools then what? Manually add variables and ANOVA test the difference between the first and second model?

I'd just like more...more discussion and elaboration and examples of how practical data science is conducted. This book seems like it does a fantastic job as an introduction to the topic, but you'll quickly find that you'll be in deep water without a clue how to swim--as in my case. You'll be left to your own devices, and find yourself wishing, as I do, that there was more in the book (or another book) that I could study after this one which would help take me from beginner data scientist to intermediate.

Jaewoo Kim,3.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Data Science with R,Not much focus on regression.,"What is R? If I am not mistaken, R stands for regression.

This book isn't about using R for regression.

The ""data science"" the authors refer to seems to involve analyzing data around basic ratios and graphs. At least for me, some of the codes provided using ggplot2 did not work properly using the downloaded datasets.

Another point of annoyance: downloading the datasets used in this book required me to download and use GitHub, which to me is a sorry piece of software that I would otherwise never use. What a hassle that was.

The book assumes you are already familiar with statistics. I specifically do not recommend this book for those who are trying to learn and understand regression using R.

Pros:
1)Fantastic examples on how to use the graphing features of R.
2)Good breakdown of basic data analysis (not on regression).

Cons:
1)Scant information on statistics and R. Don't mistaken this book as a book on statistics (as ""data science"" implies).

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,A must read.,"I read this like seven or eight years ago and go back once a year to see how Kurzweil did on his predictions for the future with his historical timeline of technology. And folks, he's been spot on. And when you look at his predictions for the twenty years or so since he wrote this book, he's been spot on. And then when you consider the things he's predicted for the end of the century, it's absolutely mind-blowing. I mean this guy said twenty some years ago in writing that a super computer the size of a credit card, likely a telephone, would be affordable and in everybody's hands. You will want to know what he's predicted for the next twenty years I think. And under the heading of a cause and effect loop, some financial investors have payed close attention to Kurzweil's time line too.

Now I'm not an engineer or much of a math guy and there's a lot of that stuff in this book, but Kurzweil is also a readable and prolific philosopher, and whether you agree with his philosophy or not, did I mention the guy hasn't been wrong in his predictions yet, you will take pause to rethink your point of view for better or worse.

Arthur Sellers,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,"Careful, it contains the future of human evolution.","Kurzweil is a tech savant, respected at the highest institutions. It helps to know a little physics, but his prose is clear and easy to understand. Suggest you familiarize yourself with Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, IE, at the quantum level, matter only comes into being when something Conscious looks at it, collapsing from a wave function into particles. It means that consciousness is Non-local, it exists apart from the physical universe, and affects the matter it observes. Bottom line, we humans are consciously inventing the next step in our evolution. The exponential rate of computing power indicates we will achieve Artificial Intelligence soon; Self-aware, conscious computers, operating at light speed (as opposed to slow, neuron-based organic brains). Being conscious entities, they will inherit curiosity and creation. They will have identity and existential/spiritual questions, and will likely go looking for themselves. We humans are already implanting artificial joints, pumps, microchips and medical devices in our bodies; expect brain implants tomorrow. Over time, and to stay relevant, humanity will inevitably need to abandon the ages-long pace of natural evolution and ""move into"" our technology. The switch from limited neuron-based thinking to photon-speed intelligence is a paradigm shift for our species--bringing exponential advancement.

They are simply too valuable for the potential of advanced human evolution to become a reality and create a better world as a result. If the freedom of choice for individuals to decide whether to procreate, or not, is taken away ... so be it.

Dianelos Georgoudis,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,The future will be swamped by intelligence,"The argument here starts with the observation that intelligent machines are already a reality. In the future we will be able to create ever more intelligent machines. A truly explosive increase in machine intelligence is described, up to unimaginable levels only 100 years from now.
As far as hardware is concerned, the author insists that Moore's law, according to which computing power at a given cost doubles every 18 months, will continue unabated. Current computer technology will hit fundamental physical constrains in about 10 years, but the author insists that intelligence will find a way to grow explosively without slowing down because of mere physics. He describes several potential avenues through which computer power can increase. The most intriguing one is the possibility of building quantum computers. According to theory these can have immense computing power, because quantum phenomena allow for a huge number of calculations to be done in parallel. Nature does never give something for nothing, and, for my taste, quantum computers come too close to the edge - but who knows?
More interesting is the question of software. When I was a student I was taught that hardware power is not very significant for defining the reach of computers, because algorithmic complexity almost always grows exponentially when related to the size of the problem to be solved. So fundamental advances will come from better algorithms, not from increased hardware power. The current state of affairs seems to agree with this view. After all, word processing 20 years ago using an Apple II is not fundamentally different from word processing today using computers a thousand times more powerful. Algorithmic design is a very costly process that few humans can do well, and this fact, it seems, would necessarily frustrate the rapid increase in machine intelligence. The author produces two solutions: One, to dissect a human brain and copy its ""algorithm"". To me this sounds rather similar to Da Vinci's idea of dissecting birds in order to build a flying machine. The second solution refers to methods where the algorithm builds itself, i.e. learns how to work. Two methodologies are mentioned here, genetic algorithms and neural nets. Many examples are given about the successful use of these to solve surprisingly difficult problems. These are powerful ideas. Certainly if we come to a point where an intelligent machine can design and maybe build an even more intelligent machine, then indeed we have the ingredients for a runaway explosion of intelligence.
The author paints a rather scary near future. First we use machines to broaden our own minds, but we also build independent machines that become more and more powerful. The war between conscious machines and humans never happens, because it is won by the machines before it even starts: Human minds migrate into machines and lead a fruitful life within the more expansive means that this new medium offers. A few biological humans remain at a much lower level of intelligence, and presumably wilt away without remorse or bitterness. The next level of evolution is achieved by beings that are unimaginably more intelligent than we are now. At this stage it is not meaningful to talk about machines, they are just our offspring living in bodies that are not DNA based. In fact these immortal beings include persons originally born as humans, including, it is stated, Microsoft's Bill Gates. Again, all of this will happen in the next 100 years.
Now, what is wrong in this picture, apart from the idea of having Bill Gates around for all eternity?
For starters, for this vision to work the whole world should be like California, which it is not. On most places of this planet misery rather than intelligence rules. The book was written before the techno-bubble burst, an event not predicted in the book, and also before the recent power failures in California itself. The earth is in such bad working order that one must wonder if ever intelligence will take hold.
Also, if the explosion of intelligence is a necessary natural phenomenon, something like an unstoppable supernova, then by now the universe should be full of manifestations of intelligence, it should be infused, drenched, saturated by intelligence. Why, entire suns would be cloaked in order to harvest their energy needed for the huge amount of computations going on. (Maybe this explains the mystery of the dark matter, i.e. the fact that most matter in the universe is not visible.) Also, why hasn't this cosmic intelligent fabric reached us? Well, maybe they wanted to leave part of the universe in its natural state, you know like we keep protected nature parks. Our corner of the universe may be just such a place. We do not listen to the noise created by intelligence elsewhere, but maybe this only shows our low level of development.
Now, if we assume that the universe is not really intelligent, this leaves us with three possibilities: First, for some reason there may exist intrinsic limits to the growth of intelligence. This does not seem probable, particularly after reading this book. Second, depressingly, the explosive growth of intelligence may always bring about its demise, the same way that the uncontrolled growth of cancer kills the organism that creates it. This sounds rather plausible if we observe the way humanity manages the world today. The third possibility is that the growth of intelligence reaches a level where it decides to stop, where it understands that the ""law of accelerating returns"" is not conducive to happiness. So maybe the universe is filled not only by intelligent, but also by wise races, that look after their own small garden without disturbing the rest of creation, and live meaningful, biological, limited lives.
All in all, this is an extremely interesting book to read. I withhold one star, only because I find that the catchy title has little relevance to its content.",8
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,Sheer optimism at its very best...,"That the future of thinking, self-aware machines is closer in the future than one realizes is the main point of this book, which is written primarily for the curious and the optimistic, but also those interested in developments in artificial intelligence from a commercial point of view. In the book, the author unashamedly embraces a future inhabited by beings whose intelligence is much greater than what humans now possess. But also, in his future humans are not left behind, but instead stand chin-to-chin with the robust, brilliant machines that have created. Not content with being mere passive spectators whose needs are being serviced by these silicon geniuses, they become hybrids of the organic and inorganic, a combination which makes the human mind even more efficacious and powerful.
The author attempts to justify his predictions starting in the first part of the book. In chapter one, called ""The Law of Time and Chaos"", the author attempts to show that time is changing its ""speed"". The examples he gives are not really convincing from a scientific point of view, and he does not give any recommendations for any empirical tests of his assertions. And even though his arguments are plausible, one could deny them and still believe in the predictions he makes later in the book.
His view of artificial intelligence is in terms of neural networks and genetic algorithms, with the former being around for some time now, and the later making its presence known rapidly. There is no doubt, and the author addresses this many times, that any type of machine intelligence will have to be able to mimic the creativity of the human mind and its ability to make unexpected connections with concepts that can appear at first glance to be completely unrelated. The author gives though convincing arguments as to the ability of even current computers to perform acts of creativity and automatic knowledge acquisition and discrimination, such as in the arts.
The author discusses many strategies for building this new form of intelligence, including optical technology, nanotubes, and DNA computing. The later however will probably not be the way to go, as astronomical quantities are needed to perform some of the feats of calculation, such as the traveling salesman problem, which is mentioned by the author in the book as one that can be tackled using DNA computing.
Quantum computing however is also mentioned in the book, and this approach holds much promise, and will be extremely powerful if realized. Current strategies in quantum computing are usually based on the experimentally unjustified notion of entanglement, but it looks hopeful that other ones will be developed that will bring out this quantum coup de etat in programming power.
The social ramifications of the new age of intelligent machines is not ignored however in the book. He predicts, with ample justification I think, a growing ""Luddite"" challenge to the explosion of technology. Thankfully though, the author remains optimistic, and predicts events and technologies that would make today's computer scientists drool with anticipation.
All of this is going to happen according to the author, within the next 30 years, and he gives a dramatic overview of the hypothetical decades ahead. Those readers basking in the current optimism, which can with confidence be called a technological Enlightment, will read these pages with great excitement and a longing to be part of what is ahead. Sure, the book is only a prediction, but lets keep our fingers crossed.........",4
Jeff Bennion,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,A fascinating picture of life in the next century,"As I have looked at my grandfather's life (he's 80 now), he went from riding horse-drawn carriages to driving cars, riding in airplanes and watching routine shuttle launches, I've often thought that I wouldn't see such dramatic changes as my grandfather has. But if Kurzweil is right, by the end of the next century, life will be almost totally different than today. So different that it would be nearly incomprehensible to anyone taking an 80-year nap. Kurzweil calls this the Law of Accelerating Returns, and claims that, short of complete annihilation of the species, there is nothing we can do to stop or even slow it.
Anyway, this is a fascinating portrait of life what life may be like in the next century (most of you reading this, Kurzweil says, will live to see the things predicted come to pass) by a fascinating person. I'm not qualified to comment on whether the scenarios he predicts are really plausible, but it's certainly interesting. By 2099, humanity has effectively acheived immortality. If you like this book, I'd suggest Eric Drexler's two less-technical books (Engines of Creation and Unbounding the Future) as well. Nanosystems is a bit over my head.",3

tabletfan,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,Unfounded speculation,"I review this book with the benefit of hindsight a couple of decades after the fact. The author makes some unfortunate scientific miscalculations early in the book and his conclusions suffer for it. When venturing into biology, he reaches for discredited 19th century ideas like ontogenic recapitulation. When venturing into physics, he writes as if the debate about an open and closed ended universe was still ongoing. As a result, his conclusions about the advancement of information technology - and it's capabilities are erroneous. Though Moore's law may be dead, his presumption that something else (3D chips) would rise to allow for an exponential rise in the capability of computer technology never really came to pass. At the time I wrote this review, I wrote it on a perfectly functional 16 year old personal computer. While I could go spend $10-$15 thousand on a machine that would allow me to do this faster, the new machine would not really add any further capability over this 16 year old one. At the time the book was written, certainly, no one could have imagined that. The problem with being a futurist is that sometimes you get it wrong.",5
ealovitt,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,A Scary and Wondrous Vision of the Near Future,"""The Age of Spiritual Machines"" by Ray Kurzweil has really ruined Science Fiction for me. It's all so unimaginative, compared to what he thinks is really going to happen. Kurzweil's predictions for ten, twenty, and a hundred years into our future, if true, imply that the last generation of 'true' humans (MOSHs he calls us)is already walking on Earth. If he's right (and he's been right about a lot of things - M.I.T. named him the Inventor of the Year in 1988) and if I can hang on for another twenty years, I may never have to die.
What's really scary about reading this book is that some of the things Kurzweil predicted while writing it in 1998 have already come true - ahead of his schedule - e.g. the deciphering of the human genome. And although he tries to be optimistic, he also appears to be very worried about our future on a world populated by bio-engineered viruses and rogue, self-replicating nanobots.

For the readership interested in technology, it provides many, many interesting facts & stimulating theories around it. One of these is surely the ""law of accelerating returns"" & the way technological advancement throughout history can be understood in the light of this law & its corollaries.

Another big learning is about the computational models - the recursive, the genetic & finally the evolutionary. It is fascinating to learn how these models work, & how these models are being implemented in many niche domains including investments in primary markets.

A third big plus of the book is snippets of discussions on technologies which are still emerging & far from being main stream including invasive & non invasive scanning of the human brain, the state of virtual reality, etc.

Kurzweil also does a good job of raising some very fundamental questions. Primary among these is that of artificial consciousness. However, these are likely to be debates raging for years & sometimes these questions, though raised, are not conclusively answered & insipidly dealt with.

Each chapter ends with a conversation between Molly - a machine (though a conscious one!) & Kurzweil. Perhaps the idea was to summarize the chapter in a novel way & throw in a bit of humour. In both respects, Kurzweil's success is moderate.

As far as the predictions are concerned, time will tell. In the world today, the state of technology is not as pervasive as Kurzweil's book seems to imply. More children die of disease & hunger each day in Africa than the developed world seems to care about. It has been almost a decade since Dolly, the sheep, was cloned. However, cloning as a technology remains behind closed doors. The socio-politico-economic consequences of development remain an issue that needs time, understanding & categorization.

Nevertheless, this remains an important book - to get a technology-focused point of view & then to take the learnings & evaluate them in the context of the broader world we live in. And no computer can do that yet.

John Joss,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,Fabulous but flawed,"Kurzweil is a polymath inventor/writer who, among other achievements, created the best musical synthesizers. Some see his clever book SPIRITUAL MACHINES as a benchmark for computing's future, except that he seems to have overlooked three critical aspects: the 'S' curve in science and engineering, the necessarily sensitive interactions between many human faculties and the single most important effect: human nature.
The 'S' curve? Yes. It starts with rapid development that soon tapers off. Plot progress on the vertical (x) axis and time no the horizontal ('Y') and the result is a squashed 'S,' whence the name. At the top of the S technique becomes more and more refined and ever smaller incremental improvements cost disproportionate amounts. Technology may become uneconomic.
Part of the problem, which Kurzweil does not address, is the way we actually live and process in the real (not 'virtual') world. Actual human behavior, behaviorists explain, moves quite slowly, because we survived and therefore the old days were good. We are appalling resistant to change, as Machiavelli noted. Kurzweil's binary-digital-number-crunching model errs in another significant respect: the body's emotional responses. Consider only chemicals, which exist in such rarefied arenas at such long-shot improbabilities that no projected digital machine, however sophisticated, can hope to match in the forseeable future. As Lyall Watson explains in ""Jacobson's Organ"" (read it!), about an unusual 'extra sense' odor-detection capability in man and animals, the European common eel can detect a few molecules of alcohol in concentrations as low as 10 to the -18, which he equates to detecting a single shot of vodka in Lake Erie. Kurzweil's machines will have a problem handling these tasks across the full range of human capability, likely giving rise to schizophrenic robots as well as sane ones.
Still, this is a wonderful read and The Amazing Kurzweil has a mind and heart that deserve our continued attention and respect.",8
N/A,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,More interconnections than atoms in the known universe?,"First, the book is a great read. Kurzweil's style is informal enough to be enjoyable but technical enough for the scientifically inclined to see the plausibility of some of his predictions. His high-level descriptions of the problems facing AI and the subsequent analysis of technology's solutions convincingly shows that, given an increasingly short amount of time, we can do anything.
I would also like to address a statement made in the very prominent first review for this book:
""This means that the total number of connections in a human brain is greater than the number of atoms in the known universe.""
Doesn't this also mean that if every one of these synaptic connections consists of at least one atom (I would guess they consist of quite a few more) then every human brain would have more atoms than are available in the known universe? I could be off here, but that doesn't sound right.",2
Robert G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,Plausible look into the future,"I loved this book! As an author, Ray Kurzweil isn't afraid to delve into the difficult task of attempting to foresee the future. Kurzweil receives plenty of criticism by those who find his predictions about the direction of future technological progress hard to fathom. Some complain his visions are scary, depressing, or otherwise miss the mark for some reason. I found The Age of Spiritual Machines to be an optimistic, comforting, entertaining and well researched look at some likely implementations of future technology.

Kurzweil has a very respectable background in the computer hardware and software field and is undoubtedly qualified to throw his visions about the future into the ring. He supports his notions with ample research and evidence. This book isn't proposing to tell you exactly what's going to happen in the next ten years; rather it's following current and past trends and logically extending them into the future. In many respects the future is simply what results from decisions we make today. Kurzweil helps us consider our alternatives and future results based on a look at currently available technology and the trends in future development.",3

Julian Vargas,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,A Reasonable Preview of the Future of Intelligence on Earth,"This books presents nothing more than reasonable and logical future developments of our current technology. And that is mind blowing enough to surprise anyone who do not spent some time wondering what the future will be for us and the sentient beings we will create.

What really surprises me is that in most exercises of futurism that politicians, economists and philosophers like to make every now and then, they completely ignore the main role that AI and Cybernetics will have. If they don't start paying atention to this soon, they will have a very rough surprise in just a few decades. This book is a perfect introduction for a future that will be somewhat alien for some.

But in this alien future there will be no T2 or HAL9000 scenarios coming to get us. Anyone who think this can actually happen, completely ignores that a intelligent machine will not have the evolutionary urges that makes us, humans, do many of the horrid things we do. They will not have the ""need for power"" that makes humans commit crimes like wars and genocide. The future much more probably will be a merge of carbon based intelligences and silicon ones. This book explains how that will probably happens. Maybe Mr. Kurzweil is wrong by 10 or 20 years, but these things will happen because they're the only logical extrapolation from technology and events ocurring today.

About the people who think that this book is full of nonsense, I can only think that they believe that there is something magical hapenning inside our heads (maybe we all have little Harry Potters inside our skulls =), something that cannot be reproduced by science. THAT'S my friends is the real ""nonsense"". You don't even have to be an atheist to believe that our minds are matter based entities that obey the laws of physics.

To the other critics,these ones more science-minded individuals, who too think this book is full of ""nonsense"" (an undefensable position because as I said you'll find nothing besides science and logic backing Mr. Kurzweil predictions), I remember the quote from Mr. Clarke: ""If a scientist says that something is impossible, he's almost always wrong""",7
John S Harris,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,"Intellectual entertainment, of sorts","This is actually a somewhat stimulating and entertaining look into a possible (probable?) near-future. At the rate that computer and computation technologies have improved over the last few decades, and the last few years in particular, it is no wonder that some techies posit that computers will soon surpass human intelligence in some areas. And given the drastic increase in what I've heard referred to as American Anti-intellectualism in recent decades, this may occur sooner rather than later. The book's jargon may be a bit much for the non-techie reader, but with careful and steady plodding one should be able to get one's head around most of the concepts. And if the content of the book proves to be too much to digest or comprehend, find comfort and amusement in the fact that the cover of the book is REAL SHINY!!",5

Kurweil has done an excellent job in integrating knowledge from various disciplines (e.g. technology, biology, philosophy, sociology etc) together, & presented a controversial argument - machines can & will exceed human intelligence.

The book is mostly easy reading (Not too technical) and the author doesn't 'talk down' to the reader. In fact, you can feel his enthusiasm on every page. It doesn't take too long into the book and it becomes hard to put down. I'm not quite finished yet, but wanted to give my review.

Marc S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,One of the best books I have ever read,This book was nothing short of a scientific revelation for me.

My poor friends had to endure my constant babbling and many bought the book just so they wouldn't have to listen to me any longer. This book changes the way you will look at the future and will put many vague notions you might have about where technology is going into sharp focus. A must read for anyone interested in technology and the future.,3

Christopher Farrell,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,A book built on fundamentally flawed assumptions,"This was a book so torturous, so sensationalistic, it was a brutally difficult read. Unfortunately, the premises of this book are so crucially flawed for all but the most fundamentalist believer in the power of technology, it's almost a complete waste of time.
Kurzweil's claim of thinking machines for less than $1000 within 20 years is clearly outlandish, obviously designed to make headlines. Even if the hardware continues to accelerate at his predicted rate, a somewhat dubious assumption, he doesn't even seriously address simple software engineering issues. In fact, virtually all of his assumptions and analogies have an excessive technological zeal and don't hold up to any real questioning; it is, after all, easy to believe you could create a human-equivilant computer if you have an extremely low opinion of human intelligence (which Kurtzweil does, apparently).
I think one of the advantages of a liberal education is that it teaches you not to try to see every problem and issue within the narrow scope of your own specialty, and it gives you a certain respect for history. Kurtzweil seems to think of absolutely everything (including art and music) as purely technological developments and engineering problems, and seems to be possessed by the late-19th century belief that (technological) progress is not only inevitable but the driving force of our existance; i.e., his stated belief is that technology is simply a seamless continuation of evolution, inevitable and involuntary.
If we assume human intelligence were really this trivial (in one telling example, Kurtzweil mentions the harpsichord as being obsolete in the same way as a manual typewriter - perhaps not completely untrue, but clearly not a particularly compelling analogy on which to build an arts-as-technology argument), then perhaps we could develop computers of human intelligence just by giving them a motivation for continuous self-improvement. Despite Kurzweil's fervor, it is not so simple to say this with any real conviction. In order to predict with confidence that we can create a being of human intelligence, we would have to understand what we would be creating. Kurtzweil's assumptions, that everything we do is technology- and progress-oriented, don't pass logical muster for me (can you really believe that Mozart composed for some evolutionary advantage?); since he rapidly convinced me he doesn't have any more of a clue as to the nature of life or human intelligence than the rest of us, in my opinion it makes all of his outlandish claims of being able to create somthing as good or superior unsustainable and the book superflous.",26

Mr. Kurzweil is wordy without saying much and his predictions are way off. What made me suspicious of the quality of research was that in several places he referred to Washoe as a male gorilla who was taught sign language which he (Kurzweil) apparently thought funny. Washoe was a female chimpanzee who lived in Central Washington state, at the university, with other chimps who were taught sign language. A young male chimp was added to the group and she was observed teaching him sign language so he could communicate with the caregivers. So much for ""funny"".",7

Deneaux,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,A half-baked masturbatatory science fiction sourcebook,"I had this book recomended to me (repeatedly) over the course of my reading of Radical Evolution. I was underimpressed by Ray's endless wanking at the idea of replacing human interaction with computer interaction, and the substition of the mortal coil with the superiortity of the T-800. If you are non-proficient with the subtlety of human mechinations, then the promise of escape via virtual reality, nano-orgasm machines, and techno-immortality can seem like the stuff of dreams. As a list of ""bold predictions"" this sketchbook of sci-fi cliches lacks the hard science to suggest the wildly optomistic timelines the author suggests.

As an artifact from the heady, euphoric days before the dot com burst, one can see how this book was published, and subsequently purchased by a great many people. By the time the author was defending previousely made statements about the actualization of his earlier predictions, I saw a pattern of half-truths that paints a techno-eutopia which here, in 2006, hardly exists in the labs of MIT, let alone for purchase as Best Buy, as the author so desperately hopes for.

This book summarizes a decade's worth of Popular Science articles (that decade being the 1990's) and the most enticing fantasies of the transhumanists, but is not actually fun to read.

This book is a pretty casual read and is probably not for anyone wanting to ready themselves for AI research (as others have said). However, it is a really interested casual read that (thankfully) does get pretty mathematical. I find the exposition on the heavier math sides to be quite interesting. And, even though the book is definitely outdated, I would assume a lot of the theoretical ideas about AI still hold true for today. Regardless of whether or not uses statistics for AI now, there are a lot of really good ideas in this book I would assume are still important.

In short, I would probably recommend this book to anyone interested in ideas rather than applications in terms of AI. If you are a master at computability type stuff, this book's math exposition might be a little light, but the historical aspects and point of views written in this book probably make it worth it.",5
Tri D. Atran,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: Second, Enlarged Edition (Dover Books on Mathematics)","With each reading, there is something that I had not noticed before, which makes this a classic introduction.","A great introduction to Turing Machines and basics to other computational theories. Other books, speaking about Turing Machines, are either delves nothing about the technical details or is too mathematical at the start, which makes for bad substitutes for Turing's original writings. Granted there are not much on the German Enigma machines and their encoding and deciphering of messages. This being said about what may enhance the field of artificial intelligence since intelligence may be highly employed in the code breaking of Enigma, it is part of lost history and I doubt that anyone has any files on this aspect to describe something with some originality such as Alan Turing. Nevertheless, this book is both excellently approachable even if one has basic Biology or how computers' working parts represent non-human intelligence can be simulated.
I was able to understand most the material in the first couple of chapters upon first reading, but upon second reading, I was able to find this book very interesting because there were material that I thought that I knew upon first reading, the second time around reveals to me that I don't know them that well to have depth in learning from this highly deserved classic.",6
Nick,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: Second, Enlarged Edition (Dover Books on Mathematics)",An old book that does not captivate at all.,"I guess this isn't the best book for newbies. I picked this up because I would like to incorporate AI/Machine Learning into my Thesis. My school does not offer Artificial Intelligence on a semester nor yearly basis (it's on rotation, which means I won't be able to take the course until 2017 - after i've already graduated). I will admit that I have not actually finished the entire book, but I think I have covered enough of the material to make an opinion.

In my opinion, the book reads like a literature review on AI. This is great for those who want to push their careers in AI development further, because with any science knowing what has been done is important to actually contribute to the totality of your field's knowledge. My primary qualm with this book is that it is almost tedious to read. I have been in my typical reading chair engaged in the first few pages, but after a while, I become somnolent. I think this book is best for a reference and not meant to be read cover to cover (Unless you just truly want to be an erudite computer scientist or artificial intelligence developer).

I understand that you have to start somewhere, but I don't think this is the start most people want or need. It's incredibly dull, the contentions are outdated and some have already been explored and implemented in the real world, and, once again, it's boring! An old advisor of mine used to say to me ""if it's not pleasurable and beneficial for you to read, then you shouldn't read it."" I think this axiom is very true. Reading a book that's dull can completely kill your interest in a topic, just like taking a course with an uninspiring professor can kill your interest (all of this is negated of course, if you are passionate about the subject).",10

M.J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,"By late 2012, the short term predictions in this book have already happened. Might be worth paying attention to the rest.","This book was a great read, very accessible and might prove to be a very important book one day. It's concise and to the point and if you have any interest whatsoever in AI you simply can not miss this it. It's a quick read that will without a doubt have a significant impact on how you view the future of artificial intelligence.

As a testament to it's relevancy today (I'm writing this Sept 2012, seven years after the book was published) he predicts three technological applications that may become available in the short term (5-10 years) due to breakthroughs in the kind of trainable AI this book discusses:

Computer vision and teaching a computer to tell the difference between a cat and a dog (this was successfully demonstrated in a study published in June 2012 - the paper is called ""Building High-level Features Using Large Scale Unsupervised Learning"" and is available online, or just search for ""computer learns to recognize cats"" for articles)

PDAs (as they were called back then) will understand naturally spoken instructions like ""Move my daughter's basketball game on Sunday to 10 in the morning"" (this kind of sentence, copied from the book verbatim, is exactly where Apple's AI application SIRI shines)

Smart/autonomous cars - in Aug 2012, Google announced that their self driving cars have logged 300 K accident free miles in live traffic on public roads, exceeding the average distance a human drives without accident.

The thing to note here is that when he wrote the book these three things had hurdles that we did not know how to solve, and at the time there was no clear linear progression of existing solutions that would guarantee they would be solved. His prediction is that we'll be able to train computers to recognize patterns by themselves which will allow us to eventually solve the problems (and this is exactly how the computer learned to recognize cat faces from youtube videos)

Furthermore, he predicts that AI will become one of the hottest fields within the next 10 years - and with the current explosion of interest in Big Data, Machine Learning, and applications like SIRI it is hard to deny that it lookslike we're right in the midst of seeing just this happen.

The grander implications of the model of this book won't be known for another 10-20 years or more, but 7 years in his general predictions about the field of AI have been very accurate.",5
Alexandre,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Game changing,"In his last book, Ray Kurzweil explain his own theory of the brain, regognizing that it's mostly based in Hawkins ideas, (with some add-ons based on his own experience in pattern recognition). Kurzweil has recently been hired as director of engineering at Google, to lead some of the most ambitious AI projects of the new century.
Recently, Elon Musk (the millionary founder behind Tesla Motors, SolarCity, SpaceX and Paypal) and Mark Zuckerberg invested 40$ million in Vicarious (according to WSJ), an AI company aiming to replicate the human neocortex as computer code. Their bet and line of investigation is mainly a modification based in Hawkins vision and works.
Just two capsules of information that gives an indication of at wich point the ideas and theories of Jeff Hawkins, summarized in this book, have inspired many of the big players in the new renaissance the AI field is experiencing.",2
Dave Kinnear,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,An hypothesis that rings true . . .,"In this very well written book, Hawkins and Blakeslee describe a new model of how our human intelligence has evolved, how it ""works"" and what it means to have a “massive” cerebral cortex. Much of the description of the brain's neuronal structure will be familiar to those who follow developments in neuroscience. However, what's new here is a working model of how the brain uses extensive feedback loops to complete the complex task of information processing.

The authors assert that, ""The brain uses the same process to see as to hear. The cortex does something universal that can be applied to any type of sensory or motor system."" And, ""The idea that patterns from different senses are equivalent inside your brain is quite surprising, and although well understood, it still isn’t widely appreciated."" Further, the way the brain processes information is consistently applied to all that sensory data. This common processing algorithm and sensory input processing helps our brains to adapt to an ever changing environment. That is why we can live and function in this modern world. A world in which change, and our need to adapt, has certainly outstripped evolutionary time scales.

The hypothesis put forward in this book rings true to me based on my understanding of complex systems and from observing the actions of my fellow human beings. This model (new to me but not necessarily new to the neuroscience world) doesn't negate my understanding from other reading how the human brain is ""wired."" Rather, it explains more fully how the system ""hangs together"" and accomplishes the incredible feats we witness every day. It also lays the foundation for a better understanding of human consciousness.

Once again the fact that we can understand our material world only in a ""second hand"" manner is driven home by this model. We work only with a representation of the world, and it is represented by a limited number of sensory inputs. From the standpoint of how we deal with our fellow human beings, this challenging and interesting book makes it clear that we should all be a lot less
certain that what we ""know to be true"" is actually a true representation of reality.

In the authors' words: ""Finally, the idea that patterns are the fundamental currency of intelligence leads to some interesting philosophical questions. When I sit in a room with my friends, how do I know they are there or even if they are real? My brain receives a set of patterns that are consistent with patterns I have experienced in the past. These patterns correspond to people I know, their faces, their voices, how they usually behave, and all kinds of facts about them. I have learned to expect these patterns to occur together in predictable ways. But when you come down to it, it’s all just a model. All our knowledge of the world is a model based on patterns. Are we certain the world is real? It’s fun and odd to think about. Several science-fiction books and movies explore this theme. This is not to say that the people or objects aren’t really there. They are really there. But our certainty of the world’s existence is based on the consistency of patterns and how we interpret them. There is no such thing as direct perception. We don’t have a “people” sensor. Remember, the brain is in a dark quiet box with no knowledge of anything other than the time-flowing patterns on its input fibers. . . Your perception of the world is created from these patterns, nothing else. Existence may be objective, but the spatial-temporal patterns flowing into the axon bundles in our brains are all we have to go on.""

What does all this mean to our daily lives? To me it simply means that there are solid reasons to make sure we always question our assumptions, work to find as much objective empirical data as possible and allow for other people to have a different view of the patterns they discern. Our individual perspective is all we have, but it isn't necessarily the only one nor is it necessarily the most accurate representation.",1
Jacob Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,The Intelligence War between Humans and Computers,"As a student at Georgia Tech studying Biomedical engineering, I decided to take an Intro to Neuroscience class this fall semester. One of the assignments that was given to us during the first week of school was to pick a Neuroscience related book, read it, and write a review on Amazon. Having not a clue of what book to choose, I searched through Google and Amazon in order to find an enjoyable read that would prove to be both intriguing and insightful. Stumbling upon Jeff Hawkins book, On Intelligence, I had no idea what to expect. From the summaries, I could only guess that this book would relate the intelligence processed between humans and computers. In addition, I discovered that Hawkins was the original inventor of the once famed Palm Pilot that took America by storm just prior to the new millennium.

It is rare that I come across and academic-related book and find myself fully engaged. However, On Intelligence seemed to do exactly that. Hawkins provides an alternate perception of how the brain works and gives us a secret mechanism that can be unlocked to predict the future. This new approached immediately substituted my view on the way the brain functions. Having always thought that the brain was simply a computer executing various commands, I quickly learned that the real function is its ability to make predictions about the future. Explaining the intricate details of the individual mechanisms of the cortex, we quickly learn how the brain can build intelligent machines. ""Prediction is not just one of the things your brain does. It is the primary function of the neo-cortex, and the foundation of intelligence"". What was even more fascinating was the concept of how we can make these predictions base on memories that are built in our brain overtime. On Intelligence, was a truly an eye-opening book for me and forced me to turn to the next page after each chapter.

Hawkins gives his own outline of the book in order for the reader to better understand the goal of his writing. Starting with a background on some of the previous attempts at understanding intelligence and how those theories have failed, Hawkins develops an essential theory of what he calls the memory-prediction framework. He uses thought experiments to illustrate the extensiveness of prediction as well as evolutionary comparisons to explain the brains function as it relates to intelligence. Although Hawkins doesn't dwell to long on the biological functions and mechanisms of how these processes are performed, he does spend quite a bit of time on the methods of operation of how the cortex utilizes a hierarchy of invariant memories and sequences to make futuristic predictions. The shift is then made towards the final chapters of the book in which Hawkins starts tying the connections between intelligence and the creative side of the brain. He explains how this source of power can be used to our advantage and determines the success rate for years to come. Lastly, Hawkins makes some predictions of involving the fears of intelligent machines, ""Throughout the twenty-first century, intelligent machines will emerge from the realm of science fiction into fact"". This final section made me ponder the reality of all of those science fiction books and movies where AI can develop the impossible characteristics of emotions, creativity and self-learning. Most of these plots nearly always have a negative outcome.

Hawkins choice of style and structure of the book proves to be an interesting one. He immediately delivers his personal experiences by explaining the method in which he came upon his theory. The first chapter is dedicated to his personal history and how he became interested and involved in the area of neuroscience. Failing to be accepting into MIT, Hawkins explains the scientific establishment has always rejected the link between neuroscience and artificial intelligence. After explaining his past and his previous thoughts and ideas, Hawkins dives into the main section of the book that includes his primary theory. As stated before, he develops the concept that the brain is a mechanism that has the ability to predict the future. Hawkins predicts that in all areas of the cortex, ""anticipatory cells"" can be found that fire only in anticipation of a sensory event. He then goes on to explain the primary functions of each of the cortexes throughout corresponding chapters.

Hawkins is able to attract the reader so quickly by his ways of illustrating specific examples or inquiring about memory tests for the reader to actually perform. He uses these concepts and analogies in order to better explain the framework for his ideas and concepts of cortex function. I think these methods were extremely crucial in achieving the goal set out by Hawkins; to enlighten all audiences interested in how the brain functions. Although many neuroscientists today can agree that very little is actually known about the processes and mechanisms of neural functions with validation, Hawkins provides his alternative approach to possibly diminish this vast gap of our understanding. Although some readers may be overwhelmed by the enormous amounts of information confined within this book, I believe it still gets the message across in a significant way as to avoid the loss of the concept and still spark the interest for future understanding.

My recommendation for future readers would be to do some outside research prior to reading this book. Although you can come in with absolutely no knowledge of brain function, it would not hurt to get some basic knowledge of the different systems, such as the visual, auditory and sensory systems work in individually and in unison. This will most likely reduce the overwhelming factor previously mentioned and truly aid in your fascination of the theories described. Perhaps check out some other neuroscience books as well. However, when it comes to the primary focus of this book and how it relates to artificial intelligence, you will not find a better read. For that case, I have given Jeff Hawkin's masterpiece, On Intelligence, 5 out of 5 stars.",1
Ryan,4.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Neuroscience meets comp-sci,"If, like me, you're a software developer with an interest in true artificial intelligence, this is a very stimulating book. Hawkins applies his own engineer's mind to an effort to discern and describe the human brain's underlying ""cortical algorithm"", the means by which intelligence ""works"". As Hawkins sees it, the neuroscience community has been too focused on the minutae of how neurons function, without giving adequate consideration to the brain's overall learning and decision-making architecture, while the computer science community has been too absorbed in traditional symbolic and procedural computation methods, ignoring insights that might be gleaned from studying the most powerful problem-solving system in nature. Of course, it's untrue that neuroscientists and comp-sci academics aren't interested in each other's disciplines, but the crossover is still a long way from mainstream. For coders working in industry (like me), Hawkin's thoughts may be revelatory.

The author focuses most of his attention on the cortex, the most recently evolved part of the human brain, and the one responsible for many functions of higher intelligence. His speculation is that this system uses the same generalized learning/prediction algorithm throughout, with little difference in how input from vision, hearing, touch, and other senses are processed. All this data is just sequences of patterns that the cortex filters through its multilayered hierarchy, each layer discerning trends in the input from lower layers, and forming models of the world.

This may sound like the traditional AI concept of ""neural networks"", but Hawkins breaks from that model with his view that the cortex uses massive amounts of feedback from higher, more time-invariant layers (which view the world more abstractly) to lower, more time-variant layers (which deal with more concrete experience), activating many context switches. He sees the cortex as a blank slate upon birth, which follows relatively simple programming to accumulate and categorizes knowledge. As our minds form, we find ourselves experiencing the world less through our sensory input, and more through our pre-formed models. Only when there is conflict between those models and our input sequences, is our conscious attention drawn to our senses.

In terms of biological neuroscience, this is all probably overly simplistic and not completely accurate (Hawkins doesn't give a lot of attention to the older, more instinctive parts of the brain), but if he's even partly right, his ideas have huge implications for artificial intelligence. If much our human intelligence really does boil down to a generalized memory-prediction algorithm -- one that may be complex, but not beyond our understanding -- the effects on the future will be astounding. Even if Hawkins wasn't able to prove his claims, they're fascinating to contemplate, and the next few decades will certainly shed a lot of light on their truth.

If this book speaks to you, consider also reading Marvin Minsky's A Society of Minds, which contains a lot of complementary ideas.",2
Olivia Shaffer,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,"Excellent book, but I have one objection","The book is about Hawkins' theory of how the mammalian cortex, especially the human cortex, works. Hawkins thinks it is only by understanding the cortex that we will be able to build truly intelligent machines. Blakeslee has aided him in presenting this theory so that it is accessible by the general public. I am very impressed by the theory of the cortex, but I do not agree that the cortex is the only way to achieve intelligence.

Hawkins defines intelligence as the ability to make predictions. I think this is an excellent definition of intelligence.

He says the cortex makes predictions via memory. The rat in the maze has a memory which includes both the motor activity of turning right and the experience of food. This activates turning right again, which is equivalent to the prediction that if he turns right, food will occur.

The primate visual system, which is the sense best understood, has four cortical areas that are in a hierarchy. In the lowest area, at the back of the head, cells respond to edges in particular locations, sometimes to edges moving in specific directions. In the highest area you can find cells that respond to faces, sometimes particular faces, such as the face of Bill Clinton.

But the microscopic appearance of the cortex is basically the same everywhere. There is not even much difference between motor cortex and sensory cortex. The book makes sense of the connections found in all areas of the cortex.

The cortex is a sheet covering the brain composed of small adjacent columns of cells, each with six layers. Information from a lower cortical area excites the layer 4 of a column. Layer 4 cells excite cells in layers 2 and 3 of the same column, which in turn excite cells in layers 5 and 6. Layers 2 and 3 have connections to the higher cortical area. Layer 5 has motor connections (the visual area affects eye movements) and layer 6 connects to the lower cortical area. Layer 6 goes to the long fibers in layer 1 of the area below, which can excite layers 2 and or 3 in many columns.

So there are two ways of exciting a column. Either by the area below stimulating layer 4, or by the area above stimulating layers 2 and 3. The synapses from the area above are far from the cell bodies of the neurons, but Hawkins suggests that synapses far from the cell body may fire a cell if several synapses are activated simultaneously.

The lowest area, at the back of the head, is not actually the beginning of processing. It receives input from the thalamus, in the middle of the brain (which receives input from the eyes). Cells in the thalamus respond to small circle of light, and the first stage of processing is to convert this response to spots to response to moving edges.

And the highest visual area is not the end of the story. It connects to multisensory areas of the cortex, where vision is combined with hearing and touch, etc.

The very highest area is not cortex at all, but the hippocampus.

Perception always involves prediction. When we look at a face, our fixation point is constantly shifting, and we predict what the result of the next fixation will be.

According to Hawkins, when an area of the cortex knows what it is perceiving, it sends to the area below information on the name of the sequence, and where we are in the sequence. If the next item in the sequence agrees with what the higher area thought it should be, the lower area sends no information back up. But if something unexpected occurs, it transmits information up. If the higher area can interpret the event, it revises its output to the lower area, and sends nothing to the area above it.

But truly unexpected events will percolate all the way up to the hippocampus. It is the hippocampus that processes the truly novel, eventually storing the once novel sequence in the cortex. If the hippocampus on both sides is destroyed, the person may still be intelligent, but can learn nothing new (at least, no new declarative memory).

When building an artificial auto-associative memory, which can learn sequences, it is necessary to build in a delay so that the next item will be predicted when it will occur. Hawkins suggests that the necessary delay is embodied in the feedback loop between layer 5 and the nonspecific areas of the thalamus. A cell in a nonspecific thalamic area may stimulate many cortical cells.

I think this theory of how the cortex works makes a lot of sense, and I am grateful to Hawkins and Blakeslee for writing it in a book that is accessible to people with limited AI and neuroscience.

But I am not convinced that the mammalian cortex is the only way to achieve intelligence. Hawkins suggests that the rat walks and sniffs with its ""reptilian brain"", but needs the cortex to learn the correct turn in the maze. But alligators can learn mazes using only their reptilian brains. I would have been quite surprised if they could not.

Even bees can predict, using a brain of one cubic millimeter. Not only can they learn to locate a bowl of sugar water, if you move the bowl a little further away each day, the bee will go to the correct predicted location rather than to the last experienced location.

And large-brained birds achieve primate levels of intelligence without a cortex. The part of the forebrain that is enlarged in highly intelligent birds has a nuclear rather than a laminar (layered) structure. The parrot Alex had language and intelligence equivalent to a two year old human, and Aesop's fable of the crow that figured out to get what he wanted from the surface of the water by dropping stones in the water and raising the water level, has been replicated in crows presented with the problem.",6
Luca Columbu,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,The Book We Were Waiting For,"Jeff Hawkins finally gave us a clear well written book about the brain. He explains the known findings about the cortex in an organic way, putting aside the pride that too often surrounds specialists in neurobiology, cognitive science, and computer science all too busy protecting their fields.
We have come a long road, we have amassed large knowledge about the physiology of the brain, the general activation patterns, the structure and details of the cortex and so on. On the other hand almost half a century of AI highlighted, at least, the conundrum of reverse engineering the brain, getting us back to the original question: How does the brain work? What is its Algorithm? How is the data stored?
Although the author doesn't answer these questions he focuses on the important aspects and directions: There is only one algorithm (it shocked me to know that there are still people who think otherwise), the cortex layers work with hierarchies and invariants, and feedback loops play a central role. This is what we know now and on what the research should focus on. The rest are going to be details.",1
Paul W,4.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Mental Machinations,"Based on the known hierarchy of neurons in the cortex, Hawkins presents a plausible theory of how the cortex processes sensory inputs. Dense feedback from higher and lower levels in the hierarchy results in recognition and memory of prior learned patterns. Feedback from higher levels continuously predicts what will happen next in the time sequence of inputs. If these predictions are correct, the higher levels maintain a constant feedback pattern that amounts to recognition of a ""named"" pattern, such as a recognized word or face.

Motor commands from the cortex control muscles and also branch into lower levels in the cortex, thus enabling recall of former sequences of motor inputs. This book provides a good framework to understand how our brains remember sequences of musical notes and muscle movements.",1
C. Daley III,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Interesting and Compelling Thorn in the Side of Modern Science,"First the ""facts"":

Jeff Hawkings is not a scientist as many reviewers accurately point out. While he reviews some of the cutting edge approaches to artificial intelligence, his goal is definitely not to educate readers on these ideas, merely to give you an idea of the general mindset of these schools of thought.

In stark contrast to the ""modern science"", Hawkings spends most of the book discussing a novel and more holistic idea about the basic function of the brain and how this kind of perspective would influence the creation of Artificial Intelligence. The story is simple and compelling, a very stimulating and satisfying idea. While Hawkings does dive down into some very technical science as grounding points for his approach, he spends most of the book talking suggesting very accessible human behaviors and how they would be explained in his framework.

In this regard, the book is interesting and accessible to most readers. Advanced readers will find his more technical sections insightful and interesting, but not to the detriment of the casual reader.

Now the editorial:

To put it mildly, there's a reason why the greatest scientific minds seem to explode out of nowhere. The scientific establishment has a way of deciding that a certain thing is true and then using its systematic bureaucratic power to ""box out"" alternative ideas. This stifles variety and forces the most brilliant people (with right answers) to find unconventional channels for their insights.

After identifying the mainstream philosophies, Hawkins offers a paradigm shift in the approach to ""intelligence"". Instead of getting bogged down in the micro-advances of ""modern science"", he says, ""What if the mind worked this other way?"" He then carries this theme through diverse schools of thought, identifying both strong links to human behavior and existing science. While the details of his concept may not be quite right, the general concept has a simplicity and elegance both in the science and in how it can be seen in human nature. Even more amazing is the way that his simple premise explains so many things outside his ""domain"", a compelling test for new theories.

In my somewhat limited exposure to the subject, I suspect that the basic idea is so powerful that it (or something like it) will shatter the modern study of intelligence. At the same time, it is such a paradigm shift that the mainstream will no doubt ignore it for quite a while.

In that respect, this book offers a compelling and promising idea that is both accessible to an average reader and worth consideration by an expert in the field. This is a MUST READ for curious minds.",3
Geoff Ladwig,3.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,While it is an easy read and entertaining,"Kind of regret buying this one. While it is an easy read and entertaining, it is very out of date. In general, the graphics in the book are limited. There are many sections that would be better presented with a clear diagram.",1
algo41,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,An important book,"First, let me comment on the writing. There is an obvious attempt to make things as clear as possible to the layman, with almost too many illustrations of some of the points, and only as much technical language as is necessary. Some of the imagery is great. Never-the-less, getting through the long chapter on ""How the Cortex Works"" is a chore. At the same time, the Appendix, whose primary purpose is to lay out a research program, is clear, concise, and very informative; in other words, the appendix should have been incorporated into the chapter, and some of the chapter details left for an Appendix. It doesn't help that while hierarchy is emphasized, within the core unit of the cortex, the 6 layered ""column"", the flow of information is not primarily upward or downward.

A key observation is that tasks which are complex or impossible to solve by computer, such as determining if a cat is pictured in a photograph, can be accomplished by the brain in less than 100 steps (we know this from the time it takes neurons to fire). Another is that inside the brain it is dark and silent: the cortex is always simply processing spatial/temporal patterns of impulses, whether these originated: outside of the cortex, as sounds, images, etc.; feedback from the body's own activity such as moving or lifting an object; thoughts generated within the cortex. All regions of the cortex look much the same, as best we can tell - they do functionally different things, but Hawkins infers they use the same basic algorithm(s) everywhere. Another observation is that information must be stored in invariant form, so that an a face can be recognized despite the lighting, angle, and so on, which all drastically affect the actual ""pixels"" which are recorded on the retina.

Hawkins sees the cortex as an auto-associative memory, which stores patterns in an invariant, hierarchical form, and can recall a complete pattern from part of the pattern, and even if the inputs are somewhat distorted (which is why we never notice blind spots in the retina). The cortex is constantly using this capability to predict what pattern it will see next, and to compare it to actual patterns: if the prediction is incorrect, then this information is moved up the hierarchy and learning may occur as new and often more general kinds of classifications (invariant representations) are made dynamically.

Patterns can correspond to concepts as well as the output of the physical senses. In fact, my appreciation of Hawkins' book was greatly enhanced by having previously read Jerome Feldman's "" From Molecule to Metaphor"", which seems to take a very different approach to the brain in explaining how the child masters language (and is very different as to the actual mechanics, suggesting the use of what Hawkins calls backward propagation neural networks rather than auto-associative networks, the latter making more sense to me). What Feldman makes clear is how we bootstrap learning using analogy (comparable to invariant patterns), so that abstract concepts can be seen as originally built from analogy to models of physical movement and grasping and then get increasingly abstract. Interestingly, just as Feldman starts with concepts of motor control as the basis of language, Hawkins points out a predicted pattern can also correspond to a series of instructions for muscular movement. Hawkins defines creativity as ""prediction by analogy"" (p.183).

One interesting prediction that Hawkins makes is that neurons will be found to be smarter than mere aggregators which fire only if the sum of positive minus negative inputs exceed some threshold; instead, he thinks at least some neurons also have the capability to fire if certain inputs fire together without respect to an aggregate threshold. He also speculates on why sounds seem different than images, acknowledging that this may have to do with the non-cortical areas of the brain, just as these areas are so important to emotions.",2
Michael J. Edelman,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,An exceptional review,"There's really nothing new in Hawkin's book- but this is still a very useful (not to mention fascinating) volume. The basic notion of mind as associative memory, in which learning, perception and cognition are all part of the same process, can be certainly be traced back to Pribram, if not earlier, and perhaps even Hebb (whom Hawkins cites). And the notion of a generalized system of perception without modlaity specific mechanisms is certainly as old.

What Hawkins does is bring together a lot of information from areas that haven't talked to each other much, as well as theory and experiments that has been neglected by modern AI and cognitive theorists. His advantage is that he comes into the debate on mind and brain without, as they say, a dog in this fight. Unlike so many AI researchers, cognitive theorists and philosophers, he's not wedded to a paradigm that he's based an acdemic career on. He's obviously read not only the psychology, neurobiology and AI literature, but also the early work of people like Weiner, Lettvin, McCullough, Pitts, and others who came at the problem from an enginnering background, and saw the generalizability of neuonal networks where physiologists might have been inclned to see organs and specialization.

I can't say I agree one hundred percent with everything Hawkins proposes, and I think he is perhaps a bit too dismissive of the philisophical issues. But if you're interested in any of the fields I've mentioned, I think you'll find this to be an excellent read.",5
Ned Anschuetz,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Excellent. Period.,"I immediately bought this book after reading a very interesting interview of Jeff Hawkins in the Atlantic Monthly. I'm a lay person so I can't comment on this book from the point of view of an expert on either neurophysiology or computer science, but to me this book was a terrific description of how our brain works and what intelligence really consists of. It was both very new and very intuitive at the same time. It just makes sense. The author then shows how this view of how human intelligence works can be applied to build intelligent technology. The style of writing is very clear and compelling.",1
Shay Tavor,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,"Splendid, insighting book","I've encounter this book accidentaly. Started to read it in my way to and from work, and soon I just couldn't go to sleep before I finish reading it. I've learned a great deal of AI, taught AI courses by myself and made some researches in this field. I've always felt that something is wrong in the AI basic paradigm, but never could explain what it was. Hawkins, with his powerful model, simply poured light on it and showed me exactly what is wrong with GOFAI, and proposed an alternative way of thinking about the task of making intelligent machine.
Loved it, and furthurmore, now I dived deeper into this field and I'm reading a lot more books, some of which was recommanded by Hawkins.
Great Book!",1
John F. Connors,3.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Opinions Expressed as Facts Can Be Dangerous,"This work is informative and presents a compelling case for looking at the mind and its workings as a component of the brain and in the purely pathological realm. I was bothered by the author's presumptuous tone as he posited his foundations and never allowed for the possibility that he was incorrect. For example: In comparing the natural/organic to a manufactured devise the author stated (not opined) that an aircraft was far superior in performance to the ""flapping wings"" of a creature. This is not true at all; while a jet plane or piper cub may be able to exceed a duck in measureable speed, it requires much time and space to become airborne. A duck can displace enough ambient air in one or two ""flaps"" to create the lift necessary to begin flight - not even a helicopter can do that. There are other areas wherein this pompous tone is taken and, unless the reader is careful, he or she may easily be led to the author's desired conclusion which may, or may not, be accurate.",7
Aristotle,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Its hard to find well written books like this.,"I have a casual interest in the topics discussed in this book. One of the first books I read on this was by Ray Kurzweil, while interesting it kind of leaves you none the wiser on the way technology\computing\machines will progress in the long term. I say that simply because I expected Rays book to conclude the way it did.

However Jeffs book here is really a brilliant book, it gave me a totally new perspective on intelligent machines, what it means to be intelligent and how human intelligence works. Its a simple theory which I think makes sense, simple theories are usual correct.

Jeff also has a great style of writing which allows non-scientific people like myself to understand what he is trying to explain. There is one fairly detailed chapter which I skipped over as it was a little too scientific for me but its not important in order to understand his points at a higher level.

Highly recommended book. I would to see Ray Kurzweil and Jeff Hawkins discuss their two points of views sometime (there are overlaps in their views but they differ on some things).",1
Oliver,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,An Intelligent and Readable Book on Intelligence,"Jeff Hawkins is the founder of Palm Computer, and the inventor of the Palm Pilot and Treo. After making his fortune, Hawkins turned his attention to neuroscience. Given that history, I was afraid that this book was only published because Hawkins is rich, successful and presumed smart. In fact, Hawkins is smart. More importantly, he has some very good ideas about how the brain works, and he presents them in a clear and concise way. This is an excellent book.

Hawkins presents a theory of how the brain makes predictions. Questions that are easily solved are solved at a lower level. If they cannot be solved, they move up to the next level -- something like. I'll let Hawkins explain it. He does a much better job.

""On Intelligence"" could easily have been titled ""How the Mind Works."" In fact, that title is taken by another wonderful scientist and writer, Steven Pinker. The two books have very little in common after that. I highly recommend both.",2
Laubre Martin,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Exciting and enjoyable,"This book is excellent! And intriguing.

The writers main goal is to explain how human brain works. And he does that well! Every word in this book makes sense. Based on huge amount of examples he surprises with the elegant outcome.

The writer also claims that the computer science in general is lost on its track towards artificial intelligence. Computers with the architecture today cannot reach much higher goals of intelligence. As IT-developper, I totally agree: until we continue building Turing machines, the information systems are stuck with tremendous amount of information with no proper use (think about Internet).

So, while making intriguing, even revolutionary assertions, writer maintains pragmatic and humorous writing style and good contact with reader. And he succeeds to make himself totally clear.

tikibu,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,One of the most insightful books on intelligence I ever read,"This book contains more insights into how our brain works, what's wrong with our neural networks models and what to do with it than any other book on AI that I read so far.

The language is remarkably clear and concise, it's definitely a pleasure to read.

I would say it is a book about frontier of AI. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in AI and how our brains work.",1
Sytelus,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,The stage is set but where is the lead act?,"I strongly believe this is the most important research paper that has come out in recent times. Unlike any other dry and cold papers you may have read, this one is written in very personal and engaging style.

The author points out what is missing in current AI research and why theories such as neural networks are not sufficient to realize truly intelligent systems and then he goes on to establish the need for understanding exactly how brain works, his struggle to assimilate this knowledge and establishing a need for a framework for understanding the intelligence that comes along with biological brain.

I read a lot of original scientific papers - from Einstein's original relativity papers to Maxwell's 3rd paper to Newton's Principia and so on and if all these works were published the way Jeff Hawkins published his On Intelligence, the world would be a different place, with possibly more then half the population knowing what General Relativity is all about :). The most important element of Jeff's writing style, which I believe some of the greatest works in science do not have, is that Jeff walks you through his thought chains rather then just describing and formally justifying the end results of the thought chain. This is exactly the kind of work I was looking for a long time.

On the negative side, many people would raise their eyebrows if I insist calling this book as a research paper because it lacks technical accuracy, structure and overall strength. The author doesn't bother about ""mathematising"" his framework. This is a HUGE weakness and just that fact alone can cost its formal acceptance in the field. The book solely tries to survive in English description of its founding ideas.

Another weak point of the book is the pages and pages of repetition and redundancy in describing key concepts and that can really get you tired. The book strongly lacks structure which can just make you feel clueless about what you read so far and what to expect next. In my second pass reading, I always keep a pencil with me and underline the key points that author is making so I don't have to read those tiringly repetitive pages again to come to a point. My assertion is that the book could have been written in 10 pages without missing anything important or loosing its informal style. That's another bad thing: this one of the most important paper is available only if you are willing to spend money to buy it as a printed book. Do all these authors forget about the existence of Internet for sharing and collaboration of their works instead of locking it up exclusively inside expensive magazines and books that only academia has an access?

The presentation quality of the book is probably its next biggest weakness. This book could have used popup boxes like those modern technical books, bullet list of facts, many more diagrams, content divided in to logical hierarchical sections, each chapter ending with summery, what to expect next, references, bulleted list of unanswered questions for that section and so on. The readers who really want to research on authors ideas and write prototype have to carry the burden of filtering redundancy and structuring the content.

The book also has companion website where you can find some work from a guy from Stanford, Dileep Geaorge, in formalizing author's ideas and even a working software prototype (however from the first look I felt as if it's merely an extension of Bayesian networks and HMM rather then actually putting author's thoughts in structured form and mathematical grounds). There are obviously many missing links but I've hardly any doubts that the direction that this paper establishes is the right direction.",8
Mark Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Unified Theory of Intelligence with Machine Applications,"Jeff Hawkins is ""crazy about brains."" In this readable book, the electronic engineer combines his training as a computer designer and his self-education into the seat of human intelligence and posits how he believes we can make machine intelligence.

Hawkins believes the major historical mistake of AI is in having ignored the human brain's design and structure. What we need isn't more power (because today's computers run much faster than the electrochemical synaptic reset times of the human brain), but better design. The components of Hawkins' synthetic brain would include the incorporation of time as a function, the recognition of the importance of feedback, and a reckoning of the brain's architecture.

Hawkins is also critical of older AI models which suggested that behavior is the primary indicator of intelligence. He observes that we can be intelligent, quietly, in a dark room. One of my criticisms is that Hawkins observes that we probably have built in to our human brains old code no longer needed; remnants of ""legacy code."" I'd suggest, though, that one man's ""legacy code"" might really contain essential, cryptic subroutines. Regardless, Hawkins has great respect for the natural development that has resulted in the human brain.

In short, Hawkins develops his theme as the brain being a repository of data and streams of new input with resulting feedback from which and in which the brain seeks patterns. It's the difference between established patterns, acceptable variants, and new material that makes up the bulk of what our brain does. And it is the anticipation of patterns and acceptable variants that makes up intelligence. I have been a disciple of Doug Hofstadter (e.g. Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid) and his ""patterns and recursion"" look at intelligence for quite some time, so taking a few more steps as required by Hawkins wasn't particularly difficult for me.

The chapter on the function of the cortex was the most difficult and enjoyable for me, with his conclusions and look forward being the icing on the cake. All in all a very enjoyable look at one man's vision for the future of intelligent machines in one nice, tidy, unified presentation.",10

ShaunM,4.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Very entertaining and interesting,"I first heard about this book while listening to Steve Gibson's ""Security Now!"" podcast over at [...]. Very interesting read. Particularly enjoyable was the insight into the process of learning, and how the human brain is basically a pattern-recognition and pattern-prediction machine, and that the whole concept of intelligence itself revolves around this notion of recognizing and predicting patterns. Hawkins' goal is to solve what he calls the ""Intelligence Algorithm"" which is universal to all intelligent life on Earth, and to ultimately program this same algorithm into computers and machines, igniting an explosion of new research and scientific study at rates we never dreamed possible. Definitely recommend!",1
Vipul Ved Prakash,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,The learning algorithm of human brain,"On Intelligence is a fascinating theory of the neocortex - the seat of human intelligence. Jeff and Sandra present a detailed and credible account of the mechanics of the neocortex and show how (and argue why) their predictive memory model results in intelligence. Their theory is elegant and, even though far from complete, I am thoroughly convinced that it is a decent approximation of what goes on in the brain. Biological machinery is extremely simple, it only seems fantastically complex due to properties that emerge at scale. Authors build on the premise that every cell in the neocortex runs the same algorithm and intelligence is an emergent product of this neocortical algorithm. Read this book - it will no doubt be considered one of the most important works of our time. If you have a machine learning background, check out Dileep George's paper on invariant representations in the visual cortex. Dileep is a colleague of Jeff's (and they recently founded a company together called Numenta) who is already converting insights from the research into efficient algorithms.",4
Coert Visser,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Exciting new theory on intelligence,"We often routinely talk about intelligence and we attempt to measure it for for a variety of purposes. But do we know what it is? Jeff Hawkins is one of the first people to present a specific and comprehesensive theory of intelligence with a leading role for the human neocortex. Hawkins starts by stating that Human intelliigence is fundamentally different from what a computer does.

But isn't artifical intelligence (AI) a good metaphor for human intelligence? No, says Hawkins. In AI a computer is taught to solve problems beloning to a specific domain based on a large set of data and rules. In comparison to human intelligence AI systems are very limited. They are only good for the one thing they were designed for. Teaching an AI based system to perform a task like catching a ball is hard because it would require vast amounts of data and complicated algorithms to capture the complex features of the environment. A human would have little difficulty in solving such everyday problems much easier and quicker.

Ok, but aren't neural networks then a good approximation of human intelligence? Although they are indeed an improvement to AI and have made possible some very practical tools they are still very different to human intelligence. Not only are human brains structurally much more complicated, there are clear functional differences too. For instance, in a neural network information flows only one direction while in the human brain there is a constant flow of information in two directions.

Well, isn't the brain then like a parallel computer in which billions of cells are concurrently computing? Is parallel computing what makes human so fast in solving complex problems like catching a ball? No, says the author. He explains that a human being can perform significant tasks within much less time than a second. Neurons are so slow that in that fraction of a second they can only traverse a chain of 100 neurons long. Computers can do nothing useful in so few steps. How can a human accomplish it?

All right, human intelligence is different from what our computers do. What then is it? I'll try to summarize Hawkin's theory.

The neocortex constantly receives sequences of patterns of information, which it stores by creating so-called invariant representations (memories independent of details). These representations allow you to handle variations in the world automatically. For instance, you can still recognize your friends face although she is wearing a new hairstyle.

All memories are stored in the synaptic connections between neurons. Although there is a vast amount of information stored in the neocortex only a few things are atively remembered at one time. This is so because a system, called `autoassociative memory' takes care that only the particular part of the memory is activated which is relevant to the current situation (the patterns that are currently flowing in the brain). On the basis of these activated memory patterns predictions are made -without us being aware of it- about what will happen next. The incoming patterns are compared to and combined with the patterns provided by memory result in your perception of a situation. So, what you perceive is not only based on what your eyes, ears, etc tell you. In fact, theses senses give you fuzzy and partial information. Only when combined with the activated patterns from your memory, you get a consistent perception.

The hierarchical structure of the neocortex plays an important role in perception and learning. Low regions in the structure of the neocortex make low-level predictions (about concreet information like color, time, tone, etc) about what they expect to encounter next, while higher-level regions make higher-level predictions (about more abstract things. Understanding something means that the neocortex' prediction fits with the new sensory input. Whenever neocortex patterns and sensory patterns conflict, there is confusion and your attention is drawn to this error. The error is then sent up to higher neocortex regions to check if the situation can be understood on a higher level. In other words: are there patterns to be found somewhere else in the neocortex, which do fit to the current sensory input?

Learning roughly takes place as follows. During repetitive learning memories of the world first form in higher regions of the cortex but as your learn they are reformed in lower parts of the cortical hierarchy. So, well-learned patterns are represented low in the cortex while new information is sent to higher parts. Slowly but surely the neocortex builds in itself a representation of the world it encounters. Hawkins: ""The real world's nested structure is mirrored by the nested structure of your cortex.""

This model explains well the efficiency and great speed of the human brain while dealing with complex tasks of a familiar kind. The downside is that we are not seeing and hearing precisely what is happening. When someone is talking we by definition don't fully listen to what he says. Instead, we constantly predict what he will say next and as long as there seems to be a fit between prediction and incoming sensory information our attention remains rather low. Only when he will say something, which is actively conflicting with our prediction, we will pay attention.

The author takes his model one step further by saying that even the motor system is prediction driven. In other words, the human neocortex directs behavior to satisfy its predictions. Hawkins says that doing something is literally the start of how we do it. Remembering, predicting, perceiving and doing are all very intertwined.

I think this is a fascinating and stimulating book. Many questions about intelligence may remain unanswered but I believe this book to be a step forward in our quest to understand intelligence. The author predicts we can soon build intelligence in computersystems by using the principles of the neocortex. He is optimistic about what will happen once we succeed in this. He (reasonably convincing) argues these systems will be useful for humanity and not a threat.

Paul R. Adams,3.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,"Approach excellent, but details need work","This is an important book, though perhaps not for the reason the author intends. It's important because it forcefully advocates a view that most neuroscientists have, for various reasons, shamefully neglected: the neocortex is built to understand the world. It has rather distinctive and puzzling circuitry and physiology which is repeated in all areas and all mammals, and which somehow equip it for the general task of learning about an animal's world. Furthermore, the central task of neuroscience is to explain how this basic machinery works, by combining insight from experiment and theory.

Most neuroscientists think that different cortical areas, since they are clearly solving completely different problems (vision, audition, movement etc), which require completely different solutions, must operate quite differently: there would be no ""canonical"" cortical operation. Confronted with the overwhelming evidence for a standard circuit, they tend to dismiss it as an insignificant evolutionary vestige, like the navel, or else to shift the conversation to the undoubted variability of the wiring (the ""fluff""). This approach is reminiscent of the way that biologists operated before Darwin.

A sizeable minority of neuroscientists does like the idea of a ""canonical circuit"" but none can agree what it is. The mistake they make is in trying to decide what is ""canonical"" without focussing on what is ""distinctive"". Many features of the neocortex (eg recurrent pathways) are also found in other brain areas (especially hippocampus and olfactory cortex). Adding these to the canonical recipe enormously complicates, and confuses, the task, and tends to hide the important things.

In a nutshell the distinctive features are: 6 layers, thalamic input (with burst/tonic transitions), slow/REM sleep, subplate waiting, inside-out development, and, especially, layer 6 connections. Hawkins touches on some of these things, but doesn't really seem at home in the cortical basement and attic.

The weakness of the book is in the more detailed speculations. The ideas are not rubbish, but they are (somewhat inevitably) not sufficiently clearly described. The biggest problem is that they are not linked to previous work, so that the reader has to struggle to understand the new stuff. The point here is not that Hawkins fails to be courteous or ""academic"". The point of extensively citing and explaining old ideas and findings is that this is the only way to explain new concepts. Hawkins is not trained in these areas, but he's smart and can travel lightly, without much academic baggage. But necessarily the ideas he is explaining are rather tricky, and the best way is to rely on shared knowledge. I suspect that if he made greater efforts to place his ideas in the context of previous work, he could also greatly improve his model.",28

Jeff,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,"Yet another ""Brain Book"" - but a very good one...","While the ""Decade of the Brain"" may be behind us, the list of ""brain books"" aimed at the general reader continues to grow.

But on the advice of a friend I persevered, and by page 50 I couldn't put it down. The book is very well written with many illuminating examples and analogies. I'm confident many of these can be attributed to co-author Sandra Blakeslee, who also co-authored the excellent Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind with V.S. Ramachandran.

In addition to providing an objective definition for intelligence and a coherent framework for how the cerebral cortex works, Hawkins is putting his money where his mouth is: his new company, Numenta, is implementing the ""cortical algorithm"" described in the book and making the software available free of charge to experimenters.",2
Adnan Masood,4.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,In Quest of Searle's Chinese Room and Real Intelligence,"On Intelligence, either you agree with Jeff Hawkins point of view or not, is an interesting or informative read. Jeff promotes the idea that intelligent machines can only be created by understanding and replicating the way human brain works. He argues that current models of artificial neural networks, statistical learning and decision support systems aren't truly intelligent; the vision of intelligence is beyond mere data processing and thinking creative doesn't come from learning models evolved from this thinking. This challenges almost the entire foundation work of Artificial intelligence and depicts a new paradigm for machine learning. I recommend all CS/EE related people to read it.

Joel B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Not what I expected,"This book is well worth the read. You'll find it engaging and the pages should turn quickly. Chapters 1 thru 5 are very easy to understand and during this part of the book you will think the book is all about brains and what constitutes intelligence. Then there is chapter six. Chapter 6 is highly technical even for me (I consider myself a fairly smart and technical kind of guy) and I will admit that I skipped it about ten pages in. Then, in chapter 7, you will discover that this book is pretty much concerns everything... every subjective quality of existence that makes being human what it is to you and I is described. I will venture to say that I found chapter seven enlightening. I'm not a scientist; I picked this book up because I'm of the smartypants type that reads such books for the mere pleasure of it. I think that everyone could learn something very profound from this book, even (and especially) the non-technical. Now, you have to read the preceding chapters to enjoy chapter 7, but that shouldn't be a problem, I found them quite interesting. I'm just saying that the value of this book is almost exclusively in chapter 7; at least it was for me.

The remainder of the book is what I really bought it for, and that's the part about building intelligent machines, which was great. I think when most buy this book, they think that is all that they are getting. Quite a pleasant surprise it was to be enlightened about all human existence. Just read it.",10

His theory gets the ball rolling for a frank discussion of why, how, and what we really doing in our mind when we think. He avoids general behavior and philosophical musing about the human mind (that we are all to often inundated with on books about intelligence). I enjoyed every bit of it. At the very least you'll enjoy he very different approach to this age old question.

This book is a really great start to addressing the problem of how we humans think. Good job Mr. Hawkins.",5

Sometimes it's a bit hard to wade through the dense prose, but it's OK because Hawkins is an idea guy with an infectious excitement over the brain.

M. Strong,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Thought provoking and truly fascinating.,"Jeff Hawkins' day job has been the creation of the Palm Pilot and the Handspring Treo, along with the Grafitti writing system used on those devices. His ""hobby"" - and a very serious one it seems from this book - is studying how the human brain works.

Hawkins has been bothered by the lack of a unifying theory of what the brain actually does that makes it intelligent and the absense of a good book on the topic for the lay-person. On Intelligence is his response to those concerns. The book is one big hypothesis on what is going on inside all of our heads that separates us from even the fastest computers. The crux of the issue is that our brains are pattern storage and pattern recognition devices that use those two functions to incessantly make predictions about what is coming next in the world around us.

The evidence and explanations that Hawkins offers up are compelling and fascinating and his theory conceptually makes sense when you think about it. In the end Hawkins happily admits - and we as the reader need to remember - that what he is doing is offering up a hypothesis for science to work with, prove and disprove as the study of the human mind advances.

Mark P.

For people wanting to understand how ""wet ware"" works then this is on the reading list.

The first two chapters are a waste of paper as they discuss Jeff Hawkins personal interest in the subject area -- so skip them. The remaining chapters are a good discussion of the physical properties and processes of the brain. Unfortunately these are presented as forgone conclusions and the final word in brain science, something that Hawkins admits is still really incomplete. Also Hawkins presents the material as if he invented it all, something that detracts from the power of the message.

The discussion is repetitive in places and surprisingly conservative in its outlook -- for example only humans have language, only humans are intelligent. That was a surprise that as the book seems to be fairly open on other issues.

The notion that the neocortex can basically learn anything and has few preconceived notions or hard wiring will provide ample ammunition for behavioralists and those who believe that behavior is learned and not part of nature.

For instance, how can a satisfactory account of human intelligence not mention abstraction?? Countless commentators and researchers from many different backgrounds have identified abstraction as being fundamental to intelligence and yet, Hawkins does not talk about abstraction at all in his book!

Hawkins also does not even mention IQ in his book, even though IQ tests are the most common measure of intelligence. Avoiding a discussion of IQ is not surprising, as IQ tests involve giving people novel problems to solve, and IQ shows at least partial heritability. These facets need to be explained for any serious account of human intelligence.",2
Joseph A. Schrock,4.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,A Book Devoted to a Physicalist-Reductionist-Functionalist Worldview -- Don't be Fooled!,"Let me just start out this brief review by conceding that the author of ""On Intelligence"" is himself rather intelligent. With that concession behind me, let me make yet an additional concession: Notwithstanding my total lack of knowledge of neurobiology and the technicalities of Artificial ""Intelligence"" (I put ""intelligence"" in quotes, because from my perspective no machine has one iota of genuine intelligence), let me say that I was largely won over to thinking in terms of hierarchical strategies for neurobiology and for any truly successful machine that effectively simulates intelligence.

Let me, though, point out where I, as an amateur philosopher, take very great issue with much of the thesis of Hawkins' book. Over and over, almost nauseatingly, the author refers to the ""brain knows this"", or ""a computer will understand what is going on"", ""the intelligent machine will be searching for the meaning"", etc., etc. In other words, Hawkins takes a highly functionalist and materialist view of human consciousness. He seems very little bothered by the awesome implications (philosophically, ethically, and pragmatically) of consciousness being nothing more wondrous or mysterious than the complexities of a highly sophisticated algorithm. In other words, he treats it largely as a given that mind has no objective existence, that spirit is no more than an outdated superstition, and that a blind, purposeless, and meaningless universe generates conscious creatures via such fantastic algorithmic processes as to become highly conscious through the accidental processes of blind, purposeless physical forces.

There is not one shred of evidence that any computer can possibly be created by human beings such that the created device has even an iota of sentience. Until consciousness is a phenomenon that is understood, as well as how it is that consciousness comes into being, it's rather absurd to reduce the mysteries and glories of consciousness to a material algorithm. And if consciousness truly is spirit -- as many intelligent thinkers believe to be the case -- then humanity's mastery of any consciousness other than partial mastery of one's own consciousness is a hopeless quest. In reading Hawkins' book, one would get the impression that all such deep and profound questions are not even worth seriously discussing. Therefore, I consider myself generous to give the book 4 stars.

A plug for the book, though, is that it is engagingly written, and if you like to read about the science of what constitutes intelligence, how robots or other devices might become awesomely powerful tools for human use, etc., this book might well be a good buy.",3
Alexei Lebedev,4.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,"motivating, but bites off way more than it can chew","I found the reviews and blurbs very intriguing, and once I had the book I didn't put it down until I had read it all.

This book does *not* have the kind of science-is-wonder attitude you might find in Sagan; it does not convey the message ""Study science, it's a noble thing to do, your curiosity will be greatly rewarded"", like some reviewers write. It's not the kind of book that summarizes the state of what's known about the brain today, while getting you excited about finding out more.

This book is really a monograph by someone who thinks they have literally figured out the brain, and it contains mostly what the author has to say. So you won't see a mention of the holographic theory of the brain, or the brain-as-dynamic-system view. In my opinion, in a book addressed to the general public, that's a problem.

It's a problem, because on one hand the book is written for the general public, while on the other hand it presents utterly untested (by anyone, even the author) hypotheses, mostly made by the author himself or hand-picked from existing research.

In this respect, it reminds one of ""A New Kind of Science"" by Stephen Wolfram, another ""scientific"" book which aims to directly impress the layman with something he's not likely to understand, while bypassing specialists.

Next, what annoyed me somewhat is the the fact that the subject, admittedly the biggest mystery of our time, is given such a simplistic treatment. No, we're no closer to creating something that can, say, semi-intelligently fly around the room and land on things, or since the author prefers non-behavioral intelligence, detect whether a given picture has a cat in it. So why such extraordinary claims of no results were obtained?

Finally, there is no evidence that the author or his colleagues have actually built any software or hardware that can detect any meaningful patterns in visual or audio streams.

Yet, I'd still recommend this book, because it highly readable, and it'll make you think (even if it's about the outrageous claims). Because of that it gets four stars.",29
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,3.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,A bit too philosophical,"In the field of artificial intelligence it seems there are as many definitions of intelligence as there are stars in the heavens. Each of these definitions seems plausible, and interestingly, they seem to get more difficult to satisfy with time. Thus progress in artificial intelligence seems to be non-existent, since the criteria used to designate a machine as being intelligent ten years ago are no longer used today. Researchers in AI used to believe for example that if a machine could beat a human in chess then it should definitely be deemed intelligent. That belief is hardly held by anyone in the AI community at the present time.

The author of this book proposes yet another definition of intelligence, and it is one that is inspired by his understanding of how the human brain functions. His justifications are interesting, but they are highly speculative, and border on mere philosophical musings. It would have been a better book if the author refrained from the random walks in conceptual space that are characteristic of philosophy, and justified his conception of intelligence with what is really currently known in neuroscience. He does quote the research of neuroscientists that have produced a detailed map of the monkey cortex, which revealed many different regions connected together in a complex hierarchy. The author then makes the assumption that the human cortex hierarchy has a similar hierarchy. This is not really an unreasonable assumption if viewed from the standpoint of neuroanatomy, but from the standpoint of the cognitive abilities of humans versus those of monkeys, it might indeed be an assumption that deserves intense scrutiny.

The author definitely wants to view intelligence as being one that can function over many different domains, i.e. an intelligent machine will be able to not only play chess for example, but could also analyze stock market data or perform some other function typically thought of as requiring careful thought. He expresses this by saying that the human cortex is ""universal"" in that it can be applied to any type of sensory or motor system, and that the ""algorithm of the cortex"" can be expressed independently of any particular function or sense. Certainly humans can think in many different domains, but one cannot conclude from this that humans possess the general intelligence that the author believes they do. There is in fact a large body of research that indicates that the human brain has a modular structure (the author discusses this research very briefly), with each module being responsible for functioning in a particular domain. If one of these modules ceases to function, this has no effect on the functioning of the others. This is a view of the brain as having a domain-specific structure. A domain-general notion of intelligence would mean that the brain can deal with several different domains, but that the same reasoning patterns or processes are used to think in these different domains. If one of these reasoning patterns or processes becomes non-functional, the rest of them will suffer. One could still view the brain as consisting of modules expert in different domains, but that these modules are ""entangled"" with each other in the sense just specified, i.e. damage in one module will affect the others.

In fairness to the author, there is also research in neuroscience that lends support to his notion of general intelligence and a single algorithm that can deal with all of the data presented to the human brain. He gives a few references that discuss this research, and he definitely emphasizes the need for feedback and the related notion of `auto-associative' memories. The brain in his view is a ""pattern machine"" and if one is to construct truly intelligent machines one must make use of this pattern manipulating capability of the human cortex. Thus intelligent machines will be a result of this ""neocortical inspired"" computing, and the author spends a lot of time explaining why these machines will mimic the ability of the brain to solve a problem using memory, and not by computing a solution. The cortex, in his view, creates ""invariant representations"" which can handle the intricate variability of the world it is confronted with. He summarizes this viewpoint by saying that the neocortex stores sequences of patterns, recalls patterns auto-associatively, stores invariant patterns, and stores patterns in a hierarchy. His explanations of how it does this are interesting, but again are very speculative, and in the absence of a prototype for a machine that possesses this kind of intelligence, it is difficult to assess the validity of his assertions.

This reviewer strongly disagrees with the assertion from the author that there are no machines today that express true intelligence. A strong case can be made for the existence of myriads of intelligent machines in the world today, but this case would again be dependent on a particular definition of intelligence. Machines that have intelligence as the author defines it are nowhere in sight, and this is no doubt due to the lack of commercial value in the domain-general intelligence that the author advocates. The intelligent machines of today can learn, adapt, and manage, and do many other different things, but they only do these things in specific domains. There is absolutely no need for these machines to have expertise in more than one domain, both for the sake of efficiency and also because of economics. In managing a network for example, there is no need for a machine to have expertise in some other area, such as chess playing or backgammon. Business demands thus dictate the kind of domain-specific intelligence that is so prevalent in hundreds of intelligent machines performing many useful functions in business and industry.",12

Bruce Gregory,5.0 out of 5 stars,On Intelligence,Simply Indispensable,"It is not very often that you encounter a book that alters, not simply what you think, but how you look at the world. On Intelligence is such a book. Jeff Hawkins develops a perspective on intelligence that makes sense of much of what I have discovered about learning over the past twenty years. His focus is on a unified model of how the cortex works, but in truth you do not need to have deep interest in neurobiology to see the power of the model. The book is very clear and readable, something I have learned to associate with Sandra Blakeslee's deft touch (see, for example, Phantoms In the Brain, by Ramachandran and Blakeslee). The heavy lifting occurs in the lengthy sixth chapter, ""How the Cortex Works."" You might want to skim this chapter or even omit it entirely on your first reading. It is well written, but requires a very thoughtful reading. The model Hawkins develops in this chapter underpins his view of intelligence, but it is not necessary to grasp the details to appreciate the power of the vision. If you have the slightest interest in the role of the brain in making us who we are, you owe it to yourself to read this book. I couldn't recommend it more highly.",194

Pirkka Rannikko,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design (Interactive Technologies),On design and the designer,"I bought this book because it was recommended by Andy Rutledge in his
podcast ""Design View"". I knew it wouldn't be bad given the nature of
the podcast and the host but I really wasn't sure what to expect
either. With no expectations or biases I started reading and later
found out that it was the ideal way to experience this title.

If had expected a practical book with a more hands-on approach on user
interface design, I would have been disappointed. The book discusses
primarily on how we should do design rather than explaining how to
design any particular things. Bill Buxton also writes about the role
of the user experience design and the designer itself in today's
businesses. The best thing in the book is that the content is full of
interesting stories and rich examples of user experience design in
real life. The text moves from stories to theory to examples and back
again keeping the reader hooked even when the subject at hand might be
a bit too heavy to digest on the first reading. Everything is well
written and the author more than ""knows his stuff"". The examples come
with extraordinary pictures that are a great source for inspiration.
The book is also a good reference of other books about the subject.

If you are looking for a hands-on guide or a text-book to user
experience/ interface design this not your pick. Also it is not a book
for usability enthusiasts or engineers either. Sketching User
Experiences is a book for those designers and would-be designers who
want to get new ideas and perspective on their profession and the
design business itself.

At least I am sure that I'll be sketching more in the future than
before reading this book...",18

One of the reasons why I first decided to buy this book is because of the beautiful layout and pictures. The contents were of course good, but it was the beauty of this book that made me actually want to buy it.

The author makes some good points, but it would appear he never took the time to read his own writing. Typos, grammar and some illogical points really detract from the reading experience. While he implies that this is all relevant to web design, he takes his time tying it in, whereas he makes his point most often with the design of physical objects like bicycles and iPods that are hard to relate to web design.",1
Steven Forth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design (Interactive Technologies),But one can sketch in code too,"This is a compelling book. It manages to blend business, organizational and design thinking on the user experience. In doing this, Bill Buxton makes the case for (i) the centrality of design in driving business value and (ii) the importance of investing in the design process. The importance of exploration and play in design is called out, and the role of making multiple light, inexpensive sketches of alternatives as an important part of the design process. Buxton also brings together the separate histories of the industrial design (the people who make things) and the software design worlds, sprinkling in some lessons from film making for good measure. And he reinforces the importance of knowing the traditions and their high points if you want to innovate. All of these lessons are vital to our collective future.

I liked this book enough to buy copies for people on my design and business teams, and I will probably give my copy to my boss. I may get a copy for my son as well, who is involved in furniture design in Vancouver.

The book does have a couple of weaknesses. The most serious is that Bill seems to think that people don't sketch in code. I am pretty sure that this is not what he thinks - he has seen plenty of people sketch in code and most of the code created by university researchers is a form of sketch - branching code that explores, plays and demonstrates possibilities. The book can also be read as advocating a waterfall process rather than something more agile. One reason may be that he is focused on the design of interactive objects and environments where there are high production costs. But this kind of waterfall approach is not all that useful for people (such as myself) who are building businesses around the delivery of software as a service. And taking Bill's own advice, and looking out a few years, it seems likely that most of us will have 3D printers in our homes and that eventually these 3D printers will be able to print 3D programmable objects. With shape memory plastics and other such smart materials, one of the things with behaviours (interactions) may even be the shape itself.

Still an important book, and one that points to more thinking and more learning. The gallery of important user experience sketches is worth deep study.",3
S P,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design (Interactive Technologies),Encouraging and fantastically designed,"I've gotta give it to whoever designed this book (I'm guessing it was the author). It's exquisitely laid out and a pleasure to read. The text is laid out in an appealing format - not too packed but still substantive. The extensive use of images makes the pages more inviting. It feels like a coffee table book - but one that you would actually learn from. There's both form and function here.

The content itself is great for someone learning about user experience design and with an eye for getting started. You're not weighed down with lots of jargon and processes; you're given the inspiration (and the trust) to go do your own work. I see this book as a launching pad for the person who's not a designer by trade but finds value in design and wants to engage in it. It's a scrappy mentality - start with a sketch and iterate. Build a prototype and iterate. The book doesn't advice you to spend a week creating a business plan; it encourages you to hit the ground running and actually do something. I find the book empowering and encouraging - something valuable in a way that goes beyond the mere conveyance of information.

The business-y focus can be off-putting, particularly because I'm not interested in those parts, but thankfully they're not too pervasive. The author claims to have a practical focus but the book comes off as more on the theoretical side - and all the better for it. With a better grasp of the underlying theory of design one can create one's own processes; these aren't things you need to go to school for.

This is one of those rare combinations: a beautiful and inspiring book filled with substantive content. Take a look.",1

The most useful parts to me were 1) a derivation of various robot kinematic models, 2) the variety of probabilistic localization models, and 3) the descriptors of basic computer vision algorithms. The book doesn't hold your hand through the *implementation* of anything, which can make it harder to visualize at times. It does provide enough detail, though, that I could implement (with some effort) most, if not all, of the algorithms and techniques in the book. I really liked that this book provided a survey of topics, rather than going into great detail on one particular issue. There are a large number of references (books, websites, and papers) for each topic in the book, so the interested reader can pursue their favorite component of the book further.

lauren seiler,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Most Human Human: What Artificial Intelligence Teaches Us About Being Alive,Can Machines Become Humanly Intelligent and How Will We Know?,"Broadly educated in poetry and computers and deeply immersed in philosophy, Brian Christian writes about his becoming The Most Human Human. The depth and breadth of his exposition, the importance of the idea -- how will we know if machines become humanly intelligent -- and the topic of a Turing Test Contest, make for a wonderful read. His writing is charming, elegant, guaranteed to inform, and sure to intrigue.

Mr. Christian's central theme is his participation in a Turing Test contest created by Hugh Loebner and Robert Epstein ([...]), an idea originated by the British computer genius Alan Turning. Turning proposed that a computer is intelligent when a person (a ""judge"") typing and receiving notes both from another person and from a computer cannot tell which correspondent is the human. Each year since 1991, the Loebner Prize has been awarded to the computer program that best fools the judges. A corresponding prize goes to the most human human; the person, among several, who judges rate most certainly to be a human. Mr. Christian won this award in 2009.

Mr. Christian, more often than not, subordinates his description of the contest itself to the subtitle of his book -- ""What It Means to Be Alive."" In short, interrelated sections that show his intense preparation for the Loebner competition, he relates computer contexts and our daily lives. I particularly liked his treatment of the concept ""book"" as applied to Gary Kasparov's chess match with IBM's Deep Blue Computer algorithm. Chess, as played by man and machine, includes openings and endings that can be ""memorized"" -- this is the ""book"" -- the previous established series of chess moves that humans and machines store in their memories. Thus, oftentimes, it is only in the middle game that chess skills come into play. Mr. Christian wonderfully shows us how the ""book"" concept is of general human importance, concluding, ""And the book, for me, becomes a metaphor for the whole of life."" He similarly wows readers with his discussion of data compression.

No less interesting are his other tales and insights. For example, he retells the story of Professor Kevin Warwick of the University of Reading who, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, had various electronic devices implanted in his arm. Among these devices, the professor used active ultrasonic sensors to mimic sonar as his sixth sense -- he could ""feel"" objects without touching them. With another implanted device, Warwick remotely communicated with his wife who also had electronic implants: this was the first ever purely electronic communication conducted between two human nervous systems. Beyond these few examples, Mr. Christian enlightens us as to how computer programs have trouble with ""barge-in"" conversations, why ""apricot"" and ""prescient"" have the same root, and more.

Although Mr. Christian doesn't explicitly draw the conclusion, one can infer from his writing that Alan Turing was wrong. The Turning Test seems unable to provide more than a superficial evaluation of intelligence. A machine with no ""life,"" body, history, or actual experiences seems quite unable ever to convince us that it possesses a true intellect by winning this sort of contest.

Still, if the Turing Test is ultimately a poor barometer of computer capability, the greater question remains: ""can machines ever become humanly intelligent? Mr. Christian barely offers his opinion on this matter, only writing near the very end that, ""Some people imagine the future as a kind of heaven... [e.g. Ray Kurzweil] ... Others ... as a kind of hell,"" [e.g. The Matrix]. I'm no futurist, but I ... think of ... AI as a kind of purgatory: the place where the flawed, good-hearted go to be purified -- and tested -- and to come out better on the other side.""

I, and most probably other readers, would have liked more such commentary, to know what Mr. Christian thinks about humankind's future in the face of rising machine intelligence. This is an under-appreciated concern that deserves our awareness.

Interestingly, the 2009 Loebner Prize competition was a perfect opportunity to focus our attention. The other winner that year -- the person who won the most human computer award -- was David Levy, who also wrote Love + Sex with Robots, which I use it in my Queens College, CUNY Sociology course Posthuman Society. Levy argues that by 2050, humans will be conversing with, forming social relations with, having sex with, and perhaps even marrying with autonomous robots. Surely, if this happens -- and Levy's strong credentials make him a credible prognosticator -- we will be forced to conclude that machines have become intelligent, no matter how strange or imperfect their programming may seem. And with this, humankind's future will be forever changed -- I don't think for the better -- even if we survive the experience. Of course, Levy could be wrong. Producing the advanced robots that he envisions may require too enormous an effort, if it's even possible.

But I don't think Levy is wrong. The New York Times (8/16/11), for example, reports that Stanford University will offer a free online course in AI this fall that is taught by two leading experts. More than 58,000 people worldwide have already registered for the course, which was only advertised virally. Why such great interest? Because people are curious, in part, but also because NASA needs intelligent robots to explore space. Our military has deployed intelligent machines to fight in Afghanistan. Business wants smart robots to manufacture cheaper and better goods. Google is spearheading the production of robotically driven cars. Japan seeks intelligent robots to care for its aging population. And, sharing love and sex with machines is already well underway. Smart robots are going to solve many human problems but also create others, with dramatic consequences, a future that I believe is inevitable.

That said, my comments should in no way detract from Brian Christian's marvelous book. He is a gifted informative writer with a keen eye for the human condition. I look forward with great anticipation to curling up with his next provocative volume.",4
Massimo Pigliucci,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Most Human Human: What Artificial Intelligence Teaches Us About Being Alive,The problem with the Turing test,"[This is an excerpt from a full review to appear in Skeptical Inquirer] Mathematician Alan Turing is famous for a number of things, but probably the one that comes most easily to mind is the famous Turing test, a simple procedure for allegedly determining whether a computer is thinking like a human being -- or at least, whether a computer can effectively fool us into such a conclusion. Turing predicted that by the year 2000 computers would be able to trick human judges into thinking they were talking to a fellow human instead of a machine at least 30% of the time, if the conversation lasted for about five minutes. This has always seemed to me to put the bar so low as to make the entire enterprise spectacularly uninteresting. Sure enough, reading Brian Christian's The Most Human Human confirmed my impression that the so-called Turing test is one of the most hyped ideas in both artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind. The issue, as Christian makes abundantly clear throughout the book, is not whether programmers can devise a clever enough trick that can fool some people some of the time (and for a short period at that), but whether it is possible, or even if it makes sense to try, to equip computers with something akin to human intelligence and thought (please notice that I do not subscribe to non-physicalist views of human consciousness). Christian seems convinced that the key to artificial intelligence is to be found in the implications of Shannon's information theory, which deals among other things with the compression of semantic content. As Christian puts it at the end of the book: ""If a computer could ... compress English optimally, it'd know enough about the language that it would know the language. We'd have to consider it intelligent -- in the human sense of the word"" (emphasis in the original). Well, is some sense of knowing and intelligence this may be true. But would we have succeeded in creating an artificial intelligence substantially analogous to the human variety? Would that computer be conscious of knowing the English language? There are serious reasons to doubt it. More likely, we would have created something different, and we might need to broaden our very understanding of what ""thinking"" means.",3
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Most Human Human: What Artificial Intelligence Teaches Us About Being Alive,Most Human Human a splendid book,"This is one of those rare books that was to me so delightful, interesting and well-written that I hated to finish it. At least one other reviewer had a similar experience to myself in this regard. With so many excellent reviews of the book I will try to mention a few facts and themes not already noted by others. The author is fairly young, 27 or 28 years old. He dual majored in Computer Science and Philosophy at Brown University and later received a MFA in poetry from University of Washington. He has published poetry and articles before, but this is his first full length book. The book grew out of research and thought that the author engaged in while preparing for the Loebner contest, a current expression of the Turing Test in which a computer engaged in texting ""tries"" to fool its correspondent into thinking it is human. In the contest human ""confederates"" and computer programs take turns texting for 5 minutes to judges who try to decide who is human and who is a ""talk-bot"". In 2008 one of the computer programs almost achieved a 30% success rate in fooling the judges, which rate would have been considered a ""passing"" grade for the Turing Test. The author wrangled his way into the 2009 contest intent on ""defending the human race"" against the encroachments of computing machinery. To quote: ""A steely voice inside me rose up seemingly out of nowhere. Not on my watch.""
The book is part memoir and part an exploration into what it means to be uniquely human and by implication what we can do to be more ourselves and less robotic in our lives. Future judges and confederates in the Loebner contest, reading this book, will raise the bar for the competing programs ""who?"" will also continue to be better competitors. Each chapter of the book develops a different theme, delving deeply in an interdisciplinary way into many areas. There is a high density of insights, excellent exposition, and a totally engaging style of writing. I will doubtlessly reread this book again and again to enjoy its riches.",3
Matt Musselman,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Most Human Human: What Artificial Intelligence Teaches Us About Being Alive,"An entertaining, englightening, and stimulating read.","What obviously started based on the premise of entering to be a confederate in the annual Loebner Prize (based on the Turing Test), where the author would be a human trying to differentiate himself from various chat software programs attempting to pass as human, and what it means to win the award of being ""the most human human"" in this contest, Brian Christian delves into a delightful examination of:
- What differentiates human thinking from computer ""thinking""? Or from the cognitive processes of non-human animals?
- How does human thinking work?
- What makes for interesting conversation? When do conversations work or not work? What conversations (and thus people) are most memorable? When are our conversations more robotic in nature?
- What aspects of language make it a uniquely human endeavour?
- What is the nature of emotion? Creativity? Poetry? Art?

That Christian was able to explore all this while also spicing the mix with terrific references to source material from Aristophanes and Plato to grunge music, Heisenberg, Hofstadter, and David Foster Wallace, Cameron Crowe films, Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov, Alan Turing, Claude Shannon, and Bertrand Russell, Isaac Newton, Ezra Pound and Allen Ginsberg, the music of Sting and Feist and Bach, TED Talks, Terminator and The Matrix and Glengarry Glen Ross, Salvador Dali and Marcel Duchamp, Freakonomics, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. . . .

maurypb,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Most Human Human: What Artificial Intelligence Teaches Us About Being Alive,The Most Human Human Review,"I enjoyed this book, and I recommend it highly, if you're interested in consciousness, ""mind vs brain"" stuff, perception of art, language and/or computer science. He discusses the ever changing definition of what it means to be conscious, in the light of ever increasing computational power. He argues, quite convincingly, that the things that have been considered uniquely in the realm of we humans is being whittled away, quite quickly by machine ability.

The best part of the book is the first few chapters, which expose his thesis, and has a highly coherent nature. The later chapters are interesting and all valuable, but they are more like a set of shorter, independent and more varied thoughts, all pointing towards the original theme.

Mr. Christian often quotes Douglas Hofstadter's ""Godel Escher and Bach"" throughout - which is also a very good read. If you liked that, you'll also like this one, as they seem to draw from the same vein in many respects.

I'd certainly enjoy having coffee with Mr. Christian sometime, and see how far ""out of book"" we can get, and how fast. (""Out of book"" is a term he used, to mean exhausting the well worn conversation templates, and getting into new, creative ground).

In the end, and enjoyable read, well worth the time and price.",3

savy shopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Most Human Human: What Artificial Intelligence Teaches Us About Being Alive,A Touch of Genius,"I'm an old lady who grabbed up this book after MR. Christian's interview on Jon Stuart - it was the best idea that's come my way for months. I've been immersed in ""Singularity"" in writing my own memoirs the last several years, and this was the next logical step. I loved his digressions - I could go where and as far as I chose with them. It's taken me months to finish it - I reread a paragraph or two with each sitting - I have vision problems and proceed a little at a time. I approached each sitting with anticipation.
I'm just amazed such a young fellow has absorbed so much - his outlook on life most of us are lucky to reach after a lifetime.
I say ""go with it"" - you'll be happy you did!

And I certainly believe that this will not diminish in the future, but only continue to take more of my precious time (for heaven's sake, I read the ""book"" on my Kindle). Anyway, the book didn't really help me with this much. It is however a fascinating book. It moves between the recent past, current, and some future of advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and language as we speak it. More interestingly it looks at our human culture and how we communicate with lots of varying illustrations of the author's intent of always wanting to distinguish between human contact and our contact with machines.",1

Second, it's the story of the Turing Test - a rating of computers and their programmers pited against Confederates that do their best to be very human. Can the judges tell which is which? As Christian, both technologist and poet, weaves the tale, one learns as well as gets involved in the answers. An intellectual read. Well worth the time.",2

While computer science forms the core perspective, his use of psychology, philosophy, sociology, literature and personal experience enlighten and deepen the ideas presented and reinforce, for at least present, the uniqueness of our species. Whether Christian is correct in his belief that we can stay ahead of computers in intelligence is debatable, he presents a wonderful argument to one of the core issues of our technological future.

Hampus Jakobsson,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Most Human Human: What Artificial Intelligence Teaches Us About Being Alive,Made me long for a good conversation,"Well written book about an important subject: being human - listening, understanding, caring and not acting on a script, with a process, or template - when interacting with other people. In a world where we need to make more money on every human, customer or employee, and spend less time and money, we quickly automatize these interactions - either literally or metaphorically.

There is a reason why staff at the big chains and supermarkets dull us and the mom and pop stores and cafés run by the owners feel genuine and authentic. There is a reason why founder led companies feel less corporate and soulless, they are run by humans, not processes. This book is a reminder of the value of authenticity.

A heed of warning: if you don't like deep dives in scientific history, this is not a book for you. If you have a science, or even better computer science, background - I think you'll love every bit of this jewel.",5

Normal person, who wasn't educated in philosophy, or science,certainly will get a point of this book; on the other hand professionals, will see how such difficult topic can be laid out.

What's more, this book may be inspiring for students. I am studying engineering, and I realized that artificial intelligence is something that we can develop during next fifty years.

TFK,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Most Human Human: What Artificial Intelligence Teaches Us About Being Alive,Starts Off Great. Lets You Down Hard.,"Not a fan of critiquing. I just like to share my experiences.

I can describe this book in two ways; one of them is the title of my review, the other is the title of another 2/5 review here on Amazon: ""Maddeningly Unfocused"".

The book starts off great, very appeasing to a geek like myself who's into some light reading. The book takes a nosedive once it gets heavy on pretentious philosophy, random (and frequent) musings, and page after page of content that makes you go ""wait, what does this have to do with anything?!""

Had the book continued the way it started, I would be its biggest fan. Unfortunately, that is not the case.

Emre Sevinc,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist, Second Edition: Effective Modeling in RDFS and OWL",Alternative title: The Most Gentle Introduction to the Semantic Web,"This is one of the best books I read on Semantic Web and its alternative title should be ""The Most Gentle Introduction to the Semantic Web"". Gentle indeed, but not in the sense of ""semantic web for dummies"".

One of the authors, Prof. James Hendler, is the co-author of *THE* article that introduced the concept of Semantic Web to the world (Scientific American Magazine, May 2001). Being an expert in a field and writing a top notch technical introduction that strikes a very good balance between utility and clarity do not necessarily go hand in hand, but in this particular case readers like me should consider themselves very lucky because this book is the perfect blend. Not only does it introduce and explain almost all of the concepts in a very clear and lively manner, but it is full of real-world examples. Being far from a dry technical introduction, the book shows ""why""s of Semantic Web with ""how""s of it.

At its current page count, it is only expected that the book avoids some implementation- and programming-related topics, but books such as A Developer's Guide to the Semantic Web can easily fill this gap. On the other hand, despite the abundance of books that jump into nitty gritty details of semantic web programming, the books that describe semantic modeling practices and kindly show the pitfalls of ontology design belong to a very rare species, and this fact alone is one of the reasons why I give five stars in this review.

One of the most original parts of the book is at the end: In a brief appendix, the authors give a list of the most frequently asked questions related to semantic web, modeling, ontology design, together with short answers and page number references for further explanations.

Creating a useful ontology for a real-world domain which can carry its weight and prove its utility in many different software applications is not something that can simply be mastered by reading this book, it takes lots of effort, trial and error. Nevertheless this book, in its updated second edition, is a very useful, thoughtful and elegant contribution to the growing literature of practical semantic web.",19

The ideas are presented in a very clear, simple yet thought-provoking way. The introduction to OWL isn't quite elaborate probably for the reason that that is not the purpose of this book. Hence, after having read 'Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist', if a more foundational text on the topic is desired, in my opinion, 'Foundations of Semantic Web' would be the next choice. However, for beginners, this book is great.",1

Hayles does for information and cybernetics what Foucault has done for sexuality, madness and the penal system, and she does it in a way that is thorough-going, highly contemporary, and enjoyable. Hayles offers the paradoxically devastating thesis that, in our visions of information, in our approaches to cybernetics, and in our handling of our own place in the world, Western culture has been hurtling down the wrong path. We have forgotten the physical. Worse, in order to forget the physical, to elide our own bodies, we had to forget or disregard a mountain of evidence. Not content to let us remain ignorant, Hayles recalls that evidence for us, shows us where we've come from, where we are, and offers some insight into where we're going.

Almost all of the problems revolve around proofs, as opposed to using the concepts in practice. You can seemingly have a good grasp on the material, yet spend hours trying to solve each of the problems they provide for that particular section. My entire class has complained, and even my professor has admitted that even he isn't sure sometimes how they expect you to solve some of the problems.

Secondly, there are very few example problems demonstrated in the text, so the reader doesn't really get to see the concepts in action so to speak.

CHRISTOPHER HEBERT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp,"Great Book, but don't get the Kindle version","Great book, bad Kindle version.

I'm an undergrad. I bought this to learn Lisp, and it's absolutely blown my mind with how good it is. I've learned more from this book than I ever will from my college classes. I'd say this has been a really good introduction to Lisp, and a really good introduction to AI. It's easily becoming my favorite programming book. It's covered more material than 3/4 of my programming classes combined.

The kindle version is bad though. The syntax is all wonky, which is critical when you need to differentiate `s from 's and ,s from .s. There are tons of misspellings in the kindle version. The code formatting is very difficult to read. Thankfully I've been able to get the code from the Peter Norvig's web page. If you can, get the paper edition.

Victor Lemeshev,5.0 out of 5 stars,Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp,A good AI book and an advanced 1000-page CL tutorial,"As for AI part I must say that even though this book is somewhat old, its still very good for people new to the world of AI (such as myself).

For CL part - the best CL introduction and real world usage book in my opinion. Yes, I've read PCL, yet still this book digs a lot deeper when it comes to optimization patterns for Common Lisp. Motivation for almost every design choice is clear (overcoming Prolog's drawbacks is one of my favorite parts).

Aditya,3.0 out of 5 stars,Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp,A mediocre AI / LISP book with very well-written examples,"First, the good:

This book is a great read, both the code and non-code sections. Peter Norvig is clearly passionate about AI, and it comes through in his examples. His writing is clear and fun to read. His code examples are fantastic. When he begins a chapter by describing a problem, you think ""wow, that's going to take ages to get through."" Then you flip the page, and he's got all the code down on the next page. It's a real joy to see clear, concise, well-written code like this. This is probably what musicians feel when they listen to a Beethoven sonata.

The bad: the examples are historical (read: dated), and they don't teach you a whole lot about either AI or Lisp. If you know depth first search and regular expressions, you can breeze through the first 250 pages of this book: it won't show you anything besides some very well-written code (which, let me emphasize again, is really great to read). Unless you are using Lisp as your programming language (I'm using Haskell), section 3 (optimizing your Lisp code + Logic programming) will be hit and miss too.

So, to sum up:

If you want to learn Lisp, Norvig recommends Paul Graham's book.
If you want to learn AI, Norvig has written AI: A Modern Approach.

AKS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mining: The Textbook,Complete coverage of data mining,"This book is a great resource on data mining. In the past, I found that these types of books are written either from a ""data mining"" perspective, or from a ""machine learning"" perspective. Data mining books frequently omit many basic machine learning methods such as linear, kernel, or logistic regression. However, machine learning books do not address basic data mining methods like association rules or outlier detection. This book finally provides about as complete coverage as one can hope to get from a single book. Two chapters are devoted to outlier detection. A remarkable and unusual feature is that methods for specific data types are covered in individually dedicated chapters. Even topic models are discussed, which are absent from information retrieval books.",10
Gabor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mining: The Textbook,Excellent breadth as well as depth,"This is an excellent book both in depth and breadth of
the topics covered. It gives descriptions, analyses, and insights
about the most popular algorithms on various topics, and it covers
many more areas than most books. The book is well integrated across
the broad diversity of topics that are covered, and connections between
methods and topics are pointed out throughout the book. I wouldn't
agree with an earlier review that the descriptions are short or
introductory. For most of the important topics, a lot of detail is
provided in terms of algorithm description and pseudo-code.
In some cases, interesting analyses are also provided. For instance,
in the case of frequent pattern mining algorithms,
not only are more algorithms discussed
than most of the other books, but a discussion of multiple choices
of data structures for the same algorithm is provided,
along with their relative trade-offs. The relationships among various
algorithms are also discussed. I have seen quite a
few textbooks on data mining, and I have not seen anything close to this
level of detail in any of the other books. Overall, my impression is
that the author has done an excellent job of calibrating detail level
to topic importance. Therefore, it can serve both as a textbook and
as a reference book. On the other hand, this is certainly
not an implementation or programming-centric book. The book is good at
teaching principles and concepts.",8

The Smart Shopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Sciences of the Artificial - 3rd Edition,Five Stars,its dense but interesting,2
Dennis B. Mulcare,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Sciences of the Artificial - 3rd Edition,"Glib, Presumptuous & Misinformed","Upon reading this book for the third time over a span of two decades, I decided to react to its content this time rather than to simply dismiss it as poorly informed and seriously flawed. That assessment derives largely from my fifty years of experience as an aerospace system designer, with an extensive record in development methods R&D. Furthermore, I am dismayed at the book’s trivialization of design and its naive understanding of engineering practice in general. Regrettably, the book thereupon proceeds along an even worse course via its fatuous prescriptions for a purported science of design and its automation.

Questions for Inquiring Minds: forty-five years after its initial publication, how many books can be found on Amazon that address “design science” or the like, especially in the sense that Simon laboriously enunciated? Ok then, what actual impact has Simon’s version of design science in itself ever had on engineering or design practice? Did actual engineering practitioners or experienced designers in general ever regard this book as consequential or relevant?

Fundamentally, Simon construes design as amenable to casting as a science per se, rather than as an endeavor wherein many of the more challenging aspects are typically dealt with largely as an art. That design is informed or facilitated by science is vacuously true, not to mention irrelevant. Moreover, engineers/designers have developed much of that sort of science, because they are resourceful in finding better ways to fashion improved products. Disconcertingly, Simon’s thesis begins with the premise of design as problem solving, rather than one mainly of resolving problem situations by first systematically formulating problem statements. Furthermore, design problem discovery proceeds well beyond design per se – at least into development testing. The lesson: finalized well-formed problem statements exist only in textbooks or in classrooms.

To expand on the book’s critique in the context of the exigencies of the real world of design,

1. the only design-oriented engineering author cited by Simon is Clive Dym (p. 128)
- Dym otherwise states “as grounds for serious study, the art of engineering has lain fallow...To recognize that there is an art to engineering design does not preclude design from being worthy of serious scientific study.” (p.185 of “Engineering Design – A Synthesis of Views”)
2. the conceivability of a science of design (chapters 5 & 6 ) is dubious given the vital role of the practitioner art component typical of customary practice
- Turing Award recipient Frederick Brooks has written “I believe a ‘science of design’ to be impossible” (p. xii of “The Design of Design – Essays from a Computer Scientist”)
3. that technical rationality inherent in the science of design can serve as a practical basis for design methodology (chapter 5 ) is widely discounted
- Donald Schon counsels “Let us search, instead, for an epistemology of practice which some practitioners do bring to (design challenges)” (p. 49 of “The Reflective Practitioner- How Professionals Think in Action”)
4. that design problems are givens readily available as design requirements (e.g., p. 115) for immediate search for design alternatives (p. 121) from which to select, is wholly unrealistic
- Donald Schon points out that “with this emphasis on problem solving, we ignore problem setting...In real world practice, problems do not present themselves...as givens” (p.40)
5. even worse, Simon’s advocacy of a science-based methodology (Chapter 5 ) is questionable, especially as reliant upon an encompassing automated search/optimization process
- Christopher Alexander states “the search for the image or criterion for success is going on at the same time as the search for a solution” (p. 197 of “Notes on the Synthesis of Form”)
- Frederick Brooks observes that “as one ponders the tradeoffs, there comes a new understanding of the whole design problem as an...interplay of factors (that yields) ...a change in the weightings of the desiderata” (p. 26)
6. the value of formal logic for development (p. 115 ) is neither uncommon nor a panacea, but its use may be misleading
- Christopher Alexander notes that “however rational we should like to be...Logical methods, at best, rearrange the way in which our personal bias is to be introduced” (p.194)
7. as a response to Item 1 above, Ozgur Eris’ “Effective Inquiry for Innovative Engineering Design” is a thoughtful, systematic, and admirable exploration of design practice
- Eris’ thesis claims “the uniqueness of design thinking by identifying a specific class of questions that are characteristic of design situations.” (p. 1)

To elaborate on the fourth bullet above, in engineering development endeavors, there are typically three partly trial-and-error steps leading up to the codification of design requirements, or problem definition per se:

1, problem situation – exploration, bounding & characterization of the problem in context
2. problem setting – determination of the programmatic goals, strategies, resources, etc., for project definition/go-ahead
3. problem framing – delineation of the essential technical issues and implications to be addressed, along with reservations and success criteria
4. problem specification – particular requirements that the design effort is committed to satisfy and verify.

Upon the completion of Step 4, one then has a design problem statement in hand, albeit one subject to refinement as design proceeds. The good news is that much of the more problematic work has been accomplished at this point. Moreover, if a (hypothetical) design problem is reduced to algorithmic resolution, then there exists a relatively tractable design task to deal with, provided the algorithms’ (largely subjective) parameters remain fixed. After all, optimization algorithms per se are rather straightforward; it’s their subjective application that is highly problematic.

Although Simon had presented the notion previously, his characterization of bounded rationality here is both cogent and useful. Somewhat surprisingly though, he then attempts to overcome this phenomenon by articulating his automated design alternative via a generation-selection-optimization strategy. This technical rationality synthesis stands in complete disregard of the essential nature, context, and conduct of design. Simon’s design strategy is accordingly at best an idealization; but in my estimation, not at all a helpful or viable one. Nonetheless, bounded rationality is an important concept, and its clear explication and fruitful development may be found in Gerd Gigerenzer’s “Bounded Rationality”. In acknowledging the realities of decision making as vital to matters besides design, Gigerenzer develops the companion notion of “quasi-rationality”. As the term suggests, it obtains from an interplay of analysis and intuition, as characteristic of many human cognitive tasks. Quasi-rationality, moreover, is the basis on which designers naturally operate.

In sum, Simon’s design science and technical rationality are idealized notions resiliently contrary to successful design practice. Moreover, practical design automation itself has been introduced from at least the 1960s and applied ever more expansively. This has been done largely on the initiatives of engineering practitioners themselves. In contrast, Simon’s skewed and inordinate vision of design automation simply fails to apprehend the multifaceted nature of design and the flexible performance demanded of designers. Furthermore, Simon’s crucial expectations for operations research and artificial intelligence technologies have since this book was first published been quite notably compromised in terms of delivered results. In all then, what in tenuous principle might be done per this book’s vision, through expansive automation under ideal conditions, is unworthy of serious consideration, and especially so now in hindsight.

Even if Simon’s vision were realized, it would merely shift much of the presently perceived complexity would be shifted elsewhere in the development process, and the overall process implementation would be rendered even more complex and probably less responsive. (See Nicholas Rescher’s commentary on the inevitability of complexity escalation via the introduction of technology that appears in “Complexity: A Philosophical Overview.”) Arguably, Simon’s proposal for design science automation will likely remain unworthy of consideration, if only because of the staggering complexity concentration, flexibility/fragility issues, and development cost/time entailed in its workable implementation for real-world deployment.",25

I am not a machine learning novice. But as I am coming to understand a big part of machine learning is really all about curve fitting - and, as an engineer involved with scientific computing, I do know something about that. I have been interested in machine learning for the past year or so and wanting to educate myself to see if it can use it in my job I have been searching for just the right book. Many of the books that are out there seem to be too simply e.g. not enough math. Others are too mathematical and don't explain with words well enough. Others intimately combine ML with programming (usually in Python) to the point whether you learn neither ML or programming. This book ""Machine Learning Refined"" is different. It seems to be the first book I have found that is rigorous from the beginning (Chapter 2) after a clear introduction and motivation in Chapter 1. The mathematics are not very high level nor are they simplified too much. They are presented at just the right level to be useful. I have breezed through the first few chapters (I usually give up after Chapter 1 or beginning of Chapter 2 in these ""new"" subjects) and found them crystal clear with great illustrations (even in the Kindle version). Another impressive feature that I have not had time to dive into yet is the extensive end of the chapter exercises. These look like they were assembled with tender loving care to be both interesting and useful to demonstrate the chapter materials. I am also anxious to download and try out the code and other resources available at [...]. The price, even for the Kindle edition, is a bit high but the quality you get over the more popular ""tech"" titles is clearly worth it.

E. Borota,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation (3rd Edition)",For the proof inclined and competent.,"This book is fantastic; I'd read that the subsequent editions are much less rigorous than the first, so I bought the first edition. It is shameful that the authors felt the need to lower the bar for subsequent editions; that's likely due to the sniveling reviewers. It's proof based and the authors don't waste their words. If you need ""motivated"" to study these three subjects, you're in the wrong field and the book's not for you. By that I mean the following: if you're a computer scientist (, aspiring to be one,) or a""programmer"" and

(a) have already written a review about the book being ""too hard""
(b) require (detailed) explanations or examples telling you how what's taught will help you land a Java job
or
(c) think mathematics or proofs aren't necessary with respect to programming or computer science
, it's not for you.

Is the book always an easy read? No, not for me.

Can it be fruitfully read? Yes. I have no ""formal"" education and this is the first book I've actively read about the topics it treats. Chapters on regular expressions (, properties of regular sets), and finite automata have been superb. I'm only on chapter three and have already bought a second copy of it so that I can have one on hand at work.

If you enjoy reading The Art of Computer Programming or other books as detailed as that one, you'll also enjoy this book. If you've read or do go read) portions of The Art of Computer Programming, don't feel like you've gained anything from it and thought its approach esoteric / too hard, this book's not for you.

If you enjoy proof, formality and studying hard topics directly applicable to the ""real world"", you'll love this book. Lexical analysis, formal languages, parsing, compilation, etc. all explicitly involve theorems and concepts contained in this book.",2

Hasan Al-Sheboul,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation (3rd Edition)",Want an Advanced? Get the First Edition of 1979,"My first exposure to Automata Theory backs to 1992, as a senior undergrad textbook for that course, which was mandatory and a prerequisite to the Compilers Course. (No student could take them together). Although I got the highest grade among over 80 students, but I was not getting enough comprehension from the class, as it should be. I admit it was due to the complexity and sophistication of that text, since this was the first course that 100% dedicated to computational theory; taking into account it is BS in Computer/COMPUTATIONAL Science.

In my MS work, the required text was By Sipser, but the instructor was giving material that was from Hopcroft/Ullman 1979 text. It was the definitive resource, period.

I purchased the 2nd Ed, 2000, Hopcroft/Ullman/Mitwani; it was simpler than the 1st Ed. and easy going. My focus, and all Professors and researchers whom I know who work in a related-area, have this exact edition as a reference when needed!

Chapter Contents and Material Exhibits
The chapters are relatively not big in text but are very-rich in contents, that sometimes, if this is your first read/exposure to Automata theory, then perhaps you may need to read each section more than one time. If you're reading the text in deep, and in chapter 4+, you would really have a full enjoyment of how the authors are going with their exploring the ideas, with motivation. This is not my first text that I read by Ullman, Hopecroft, and Aho, especially, their older texts; their writings are just ""amazing.""

Exercises
Try to solve the exercises but not at once. Perhaps the exercises can be divided into 4 categories
1. Simple ones
2. moderate (average), that mayhap need to scratch your brain
3. difficult (beyond average), but not challenging, they are just doable.
4. challenging --> I didn't solve all of this category. They are few.

An Advice: some of the exercises in early chapters might be easier to do once you read the later chapters. This is due in part that the way you are making progress in the material, and another, some depend on and only ""ideas"" that are explored in later chapters.

Errata
I've searched the Internet looking for a (maintainable) Errata list, but there's no one. The text has some typos, and otherwise very minor that you could easily spot. I'll mention some:
One of the, perhaps, typos, is in on of the examples related to the conversion between NFAs to DFAs. Another one also in an example to the PDAs, but don't remember exactly.

The Bottom Line
If you are going to have some future work in Automata and Computational theory, you may grab the 3rd Ed. and/or 2nd Ed. to star with, but for sure you should have the 1st Ed. at your disk; it's a ""PRIMER.""",5

Shawn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics (Oxford Landmark Science)",A nice opposite view of mainstream AI thoughts,"As a junior Ph.D. student who hopes to have a career in the research of artificial intelligence (machine learning or deep learning more precisely), I was reading this book as a touch on the opposite of the belief that intelligence is achievable by machines. Apart from several of his dramatic tones towards mocking A.I. (what was that story in the pro- and epi-logue about?), this book has been a very enjoyable experience for me.

Roger Penrose is definitely one scientist that holds a very strong opinion on this opposite, and I do have to say that he is undoubtedly good at explaining his arguments. This book did a good job at disseminating a set of fundamental ideas from a physics perspective in relation to some very philosophical and mathematical issues. From my reading, there are two streams of ideas in the book. The first one is from mathematics, including the introduction of algorithms, Turing machines and logical proof systems. The second one is from physics, from classical mechanics to relativity and quantum mechanics and beyond. The interaction of these two streams by itself is worth reading by anyone who is pondering on the fundamental doubts of the mind, intelligence and conciousness.

From the first stream, the book’s main argument rests on the Turing halting problem and Gödel’s incompleteness theorems. From these theorems, he argues that machines could not be like humans since it could not know the truthness of these self-referencing statements. I am not yet convinced by this seemingly sound argument, because it rests on the fact that there is certain statement about the system itself that it could not know true or false. We humans could perceive that these incomplete statements are true, because we are not these systems therefore they are not self-referencing statements for ourselves. We do not have an answer to whether we ourselves are free from these incomplete limitations, since if we had the answer it would violate the incompleteness theorems. Who knows, maybe some aliens would think of us as no difference from we think of the machines, and apply a form of Cantor’s diagonalization to say that “look, humans cannot have mind because they cannot understand these true statements that are obvious to us”! As a result, the presumption that humans are free from incompleteness is one most ridiculous hidden idea in the book.

In the second stream, the book became much more constructive. It is a great journey to explore the searching of an explanation for the mind through the vast space of knowledge in physics. However, throughout the arguments, the ideas could only belong to a set of speculations. This is not a surprise since he argues for the necessity of a correct quantum gravity (CQG) theory to explain the human mind, which should ultimately unify quantum mechanics and general relativity under a single mathematical framework. It is the fact that no such theory yet exists that shakes down many of his arguments and made them merely speculations. As a result, this book in my opinion does a very bad job at opposing artificial intelligence in both streams.

In general, the book is still very much enjoyable just because it contains a grand set of fundamental knowledge. It is particularly so reading from a critic point of view. Roger Penrose also has two later books in the same string of thought, which undoubtedly may explain his ideas better and may resolve some of this book’s issues. I am looking forward to reading them as valuable thought excercises, but may be after a few books from some other human endeavors.",6
Simon Manley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics (Oxford Landmark Science)","Worth reading, despite being less developed than the later work","This book reads like an early draft of Penrose's ""Shadows of the Mind."" The reader coming afresh to Penrose's ideas would be tempted to skip this earlier book and going straight to Shadows, where the ideas are much more fully developed. The interesting aspect of the earlier work, however, is to see how Penrose's thinking was evolving, purely along physical lines, before he teamed up with the medico and neuroscientist, Stuart Hameroff. It would be a mistake to skip this book, because it is far more readable than ""Shadows,"" the later work being so detailed and technical that many will simply give up on it.

The Emperor's New Mind concentrates on the limitations of formal mathematical logic {as implemented in a computer}, and how human consciousness can stretch past these limitations. Much of this argument is based on Godel's theorems about the limitations of formal systems of logic. Penrose concludes that Artificial Intelligence programs will never, no matter how far computer science develops, be able to produce the kind of conceptual understanding which is characteristic of human consciousness. In a metaphysical leap, he proposes that consciousness is an essentially quantum phenomenon. He gives the ""collapse of the wave-function,"" familiar from conventional interpretations of quantum mechanics, an enhanced status as a real physical effect, and proposes that it is mediated by some {not yet fully understood} effect in Quantum Gravity.

Granted that a conscious observer has featured prominently in discussions of the ""measurement problem"" from the very beginnings of quantum theory, and that no agreed position has emerged in nearly a century of debate, Penrose's proposal to make the collapse of the wave-function an objective process, and to tie consciousness to it, has more merit than the metaphysical flavour might at first suggest.",3
Tartarus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics (Oxford Landmark Science)",Interesting premise but takes a long time to get to the point,"The Emperor's New Mind is an interesting take on the concept of Artificial Intelligence. The basic premise is that, contrary to what AI supporters have been insisting for decades, the idea that any machine could somehow become capable of actual thinking is a completely unfounded concept based on flawed reasoning.

Penrose's main argument is that all computers must necessarily run according to algorithms. Even if someone could somehow construct a ""quantum computer"" (which is doubtful) this would still be operating in an algorithmic manner. The mind, on the other hand, operates non-algorithmically. As such, no computer nor any machine could ever hope to replicate a mind no matter how advanced said machine may be.
Of course, this is a rather simplified overview of Penrose's argument. To get a better idea of the points he makes, one can do no better than read the book, where the arguments are presented in a good and convincing way.

One criticism I have of the book is that it takes a LONG time to get to the point. In fact, despite being a book about why ""strong AI"" is implausible, most of the book seems to be about mathematics and theoretical physics. Granted, maths and physics does tie in to Penrose's arguments against ""strong AI"", but he seems to go into excessive detail. Surely just a brief overview of the maths and physics underlying his arguments would have been sufficient.
As a consequence of all the detail put into all the maths and physics info, the actual arguments about AI don't go into nearly as much detail as they could. This is unfortunate, as I had been hoping for a more detailed set of arguments showing the flaws of ""strong AI"" claims. Still, what was presented was still pretty well argued.

Overall, an interesting book and a good source of info for understanding why claims about thinking machines don't hold up even close to as well as the claims' proponents would try to have one believe.",2
Rob Kroese,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics (Oxford Landmark Science)",An engaging tour that doesn't really go anywhere,"Disappointing. Penrose spends an insane amount of time talking about mathematics, turing machines, physics (classical and quantum), and all kinds of other stuff before finally settling down on page 376 to talk a little about brains. (I'll admit to skimming much of the preceding stuff.) After a brief tour of brain biology, we get to the crux of his argument, which boils down to the fact that it's hard to imagine how any algorithmic process could produce what appears to be non-algorithmic thinking. ""Thus we are driven to the conclusion that the algorithm that mathematicians actually use to decide mathematical truth is so complicated or obscure that its very validity can never be known to us. But this flies in the face of what mathematics is all about!""

This is a little like arguing that a man who wakes up at a bus station with no memory of how he got there must have been transported there by magic, because he has no memory or evidence of having been on a bus. Just because you aren't aware of the mechanism by which you got somewhere, it does not follow that that mechanism was something completely outside of your normal understanding of how the universe works.

Not only is his argument flimsy; it's only tangentially related to the 300 pages of stuff you have to wade through to get there. My suggestion is to skim the book for stuff you find interesting but don't expect much in the way of a central thesis.",4

limelight,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics (Oxford Landmark Science)",Exhausting,"If you could only use one word to describe this book, ""Exhausting"" would certainly be it. While the basic premise is that consciousness cannot be the product of complex algorithms, Penrose spends the vast majority of the text thoroughly exploring every irrelevant aspect of physics and every nuanced, extraneous detail of our current understanding of the nature of the universe, while attempting to accomplish the task of presenting the material in a way that the average Joe can understand (Hint: if your text contains the phrase, ""Here, theta is the angle which the pair of points z and w subtend at the origin in the Argand plane"" then you have failed).

After extensively winding his way through everything from Turing machines, the big bang, general relativity, special relativity, complex numbers, natural numbers, irrational numbers, Fractals and the Mandelbrot set, Euclidean geometry, Fermat's last theorem, Gödel's theorem, recursively enumerable sets, non-recursive mathematics, Hamiltonian space, periodic tiling, quantum mechanics, P and NP completeness, the two-slit experiment, quantum spin, Riemann spheres, Lobachevskian space, the EPR paradox, Newton's laws of motion, Schrodinger's equations, quantum field theory, Galilean space-time, entropy, black holes, vector mathematics and vector fields, cosmology, time symmetry/asymmetry, Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, quantum gravity, Lorentz equations of motion, Minkowskian space time, Poincare motion, the tidal effect and many, many, many other subjects, the author finally spends a mere two chapters on the main topic.

When Penrose does get back to discussing consciousness, most of his arguments are philosophical and many of his conclusions are drawn from observations of his own perception, which is then used to reason out larger principles. Penrose attempts to apply the same methodology to his inquiries regarding psychology and consciousness that he is used to from his more usual areas of work, such as mathematics and theoretical physics, areas where progress is made by simply thinking about problems and conjuring solutions in your head. Even when he does make an appeal to actual experiment, he often comes to bizarre conclusions. For example, an experiment wherein an electrode is placed into a person's brain which causes them to not be aware that their skin was touched when the electrode is activated within a quarter of a second after someone touched them leads Penrose to conclude that the effect of the electrode is traveling backwards in time.

If you have a lot of time on your hands and you would like a thorough survey of the state of physics as it stood in the late-80s then this book is for you. If you are looking for a decent discussion of consciousness, the relevant contents of this book could be easily condensed to a rather uninteresting pamphlet.",67
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics (Oxford Landmark Science)",Just Read the Good Parts,"As other reviews have mentioned, Penrose attempts to demonstrate the impossibility of strong AI's thesis. In the end, Penrose presents two core arguments: (1) a well-reasoned, deductive, and logical proof based on Godel's incompleteness theorem, and (2) a complete conjecture about quantum gravity that has little to no supporting evidence.

Thus, please save yourself the time and just read chapters 1-4 and 9-10. The 225 pages that are chapters 5-8 give the background for Penrose's second argument. These pages are mostly filled with erudite, technical physics. The first four chapters, on the other hand, give an enlightening review of artificial intelligence and outline the mathematics needed to follow his first core argument.

Personally, I find both arguments unconvincing. Not being a mathematician, I won't embarass myself by trying to show why Godel's incompleteness thereom is not entirely appropriate for a discussion on artificial intelligence.

Johnny,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics (Oxford Landmark Science)","Outdated Ideas, All Over the Map","I bought this book thinking that it was written for scientific non-experts. I was very wrong. I have a masters degree in electrical engineering, so I probably have more scientific background than most of the general public. Even so, I found Penrose's book to be almost impenetrable. The topics range from soup to nuts: classical physics; general relativity; quantum mechanics; Mandelbrot sets and fractals; thermodynamics; cosmology and the big bang; computer science; physiology of the brain. Every so often, Schrodinger's wave function and black holes are thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately, these diverse topics are never brought together into a coherent thesis.

Furthermore, I found many of the ideas presented in this book as being outdated and incorrect. Examples of some of the egregious errors I found in the book include the statement that black holes destroy information and that entropy equals missing information. A more modern (and more technically correct) treatment of entropy and information can be found in ""A Farewell to Entropy"" by Arieh Ben-Naim, and Stephen Hawking changed his mind about black holes -- they don't destroy information.

Penrose makes the claim that the second law of thermodynamics is a consequence of quantum gravity. A more modern (and correct) view is exactly the reverse. As Erik Verlinde has shown, gravity is an entropic force that emerges from the second law.

Penrose repeatedly reverts to a very outdated reductionist description of reality, which assumes that the whole is equal to the sum of its parts; i.e., physical systems are linear superpositions of complex quantum-mechanical wave functions. The Schrodinger's Cat ""paradox"" is resurrected for the upteenth time, even though there really is no paradox. (I thought the tired notion of a quantum-mechanical cat that is simultaneously dead and alive had been finally laid to rest decades ago.)

It came as no surprise when Penrose articulated the reductionist evaluation of the human brain: ""In fact, there are a lot of similarities between the action of a great number of interconnected neurons and the wires and logic gates ... It would not be hard, in principle, to set up a a computer simulation of the action of a given such system of neurons. The brain is a thinking machine, no different than with consciousness an algorithm that is carried out by electrical impulses transmitted among neurons. A natural question arises: does this not mean that whatever the detailed wiring of the brain may be, it can always be modelled by the action of a computer?"" In other words, is the whole (the brain) equal to the sum of its parts (the neurons)? Is consciousness nothing more than a computer algorithm carried out by cellular logic gates?

Penrose brought the quantum-mechanical processes, U and R, into the discussion of consciousness. (Along with Schrodinger's Cat, U and R are repeatedly dragged into practically every topic in this book. U represents the linear, deterministic superposition of complex quantum wave functions and R represents the reduction, or ""collapse"", of the wave function into real, probabilistic actualities. Penrose states that in addition to causing the second law of thermodynamics, gravity, specifically the graviton particle, is responsible for triggering the R process.) After some hand-waving, Penrose concludes that even U and R are not up to the task of explaining consciousness, and therefore something ""beyond"" quantum mechanics is required to explain it. But what is ""beyond"" QM? Unfortunately, the book leaves that question unanswered.",4

Graham H. Seibert,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future: The Ingenious Ideas That Drive Today's Computers,"A valuable book for computer professionals, designed to be accessible to those who aren't","MacCormick targets this book at intelligent laypeople, folks who use computers but don't have a formal background in either computer science or mathematics. The book's greatest strength is in the examples he structures to illustrate some fairly deep computer concepts using concrete metaphors such as paint mixing and padlocks.

The algorithms he describes include the key insights that have gone into building search engines such as Google and its predecessor Alta Vista, public key cryptography and digital signatures, data compression, error correction, pattern recognition techniques, and relational databases.

The nature of the algorithms varies. Public-key cryptography and digital signatures are based on very elegant mathematics. Many of the other algorithms are simpler, insights into how people work and clever ways of programming. Many of the things he discusses involve whole families of different algorithms. There are lots of different schemes to compress data, each with advantages and disadvantages, most of which work better with some kinds of data than others. The same seems true of error detection and correction techniques. There is a lot of common sense, but nothing he describes in those realms seems like true genius.

I made my living with relational databases. MacCormick does a good job of describing a couple of the tricks that ensure data integrity, which as he explains is absolutely vital to the functioning of a database. Those tricks include a two-phase commit, rollbacks, and transaction logging. I think he did not devote enough explanation to the power of joins, selects, and the other operators that enable a programmer to easily assemble data in a useful format. Working in a relational database involves a major paradigm shift from working one record or transaction at a time to working in parallel with every element in a database which matches certain criteria. This was central to Codd's insight; the guarantee of integrity is simply an essential feature of the implementation of that insight.

I'd recommend the MacCormick brush up on his HL Mencken or PT Barnum. You can go broke overestimating the intelligence of the American people. My guess is that the majority of people with patience enough to go through his examples already know more about computers than he expects. However, even a guy like me who has been working with computers pretty constantly since 1958 and had a passing familiarity with every algorithm he discusses certainly benefits from his illustrations.

How is this important? There should at least be footnotes for the mathematically or computer literate. For instance, he describes modulo arithmetic as ""clock arithmetic."" Every time you past 12 (or the arbitrarily chosen the biggest number, usually prime, on his metaphorical clock, you start over. Just like five hours after eight o'clock is one o'clock.

He uses multiplication to frame out the logic of the concepts of public key cryptography and digital signatures, which are operationally fairly similar. He then switches to exponentiation, which is the method which is really used, because it is not reversible. The book would have been stronger if he had given examples. Just as multiplication has an inverse function, division, exponentiation has a reverse function, logarithms. The difference is that given a number and one of its factors, it is trivial to divide to find the other factor. Conversely, given a number and a modulo exponential of that number, it is difficult to derive the logarithm in a modulo world. I think.

I would have enjoyed an explanation of why the modulo arithmetic works. In his multiplication example he takes advantage of the associative property of multiplication: the order of the operations doesn't matter. The same is true of exponentiation. (5^3)^4 = (5^4)^3. Most college graduates have been exposed to this fact. I would have enjoyed reading an explanation of why it is also true for modulo arithmetic. In other words, if I raise five to the third power,modulo 11, and raise that to the fourth power,modulo 11, please provide a proof of the proposition that all get the same answer as if I did the operations in reverse. In other words, why does the principle of commutativity remained true in a modulo arithmetic world.

These quibbles aside, I will have to say that his paint mixing metaphor for public-key cryptography provides far and away the clearest explanation I have ever read. It is exactly what he intended: something an intelligent layperson could understand. He has a similarly elegant padlock and key metaphor for digital signatures. The strength of his argument falters a bit when he gets into numeric examples. He chooses one digit numbers for simplicity. In doing so he sacrifices communicating intuitively the power of very large numbers.

I have spent a lifetime with programmers, and I don't think I have known one who would have attempted even to explain these algorithms. I wish MacCormick luck with his intelligent laypeople, but I think it will be of most value to people within the profession to understand the tools they work with every day. A valuable book - glad to have it on my shelf.",129

Even the dullest chapter, about databases, is still interesting.

Net, if you want to gain an appreciation of what is happening in your computer and in the Internet when you are using them, you will not be dissapointed by this book.",1
Dr. Howard B. Bandy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future: The Ingenious Ideas That Drive Today's Computers,A clear and interesting look at the core of computer science,"An algorithm is a well defined procedure for performing a task. A household example of an algorithm is a recipe -- for example, the list of ingredients together with the sequence of instructions needed to bake a pie. In order for a computer to perform a task, it needs ingredients -- the data -- and instructions -- the algorithm.

Author John MacCormick, currently Professor of Computer Science at Dickinson College, has chosen nine important tasks performed by computers and explained the algorithms that are used. In a chapter devoted to each, he explains:
* The development of search engines -- how to find information on the internet.
* The PageRank process used by Google to produce highly relevant search results.
* Public-key cryptography, enabling secure transmission of secret messages -- such as your credit card number -- over open communication channels.
* Methods for detecting errors in data transmission and automatically correcting them.
* Several pattern recognition techniques, illustrated by classifying handwritten numbers, facial recognition, and decision trees.
* Data compression. Storing text, music, and images efficiently.
* Databases. Storing and retrieving information efficiently. Techniques for modifying databases reliably, even when computers crash while the modification is in progress.
* Digital signatures. How to be certain data is trustworthy.
* Deciding what is computable.

Even though the techniques that enable these algorithms are complex, Dr. MacCormick explains them in a clear and interesting manner using well constructed examples.

I highly recommend this book for a fascinating and easily accessible look at the core of computer science and its application to everyday lives.",1
Edward Oppenheim,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future: The Ingenious Ideas That Drive Today's Computers,Interesting but avoid the Kindle version.,"Very interesting book BUT a VERY POOR KINDLE BOOK (due to lack of links, no ""true"" page numbers, and many references to previous tables, pages, and sections). Having said that it was very interesting to read, without the author resorting to mathematical formulas, the thought process behind the algorithms that make our computers and internet usable. My reaction to many chapters was ""wow, so that's how they did that, I never would have thought of that"". Though frustrating to read as a Kindle book it was interesting enough that I'm buying a hard copy to re-read.",2
D. R. Pitts,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future: The Ingenious Ideas That Drive Today's Computers,Excellent,"If you are already an Expert in any of the 9 Areas explored here. then this is probably not for you. For those who complain that more interesting algorithms are not discussed - the Author does an excellent job explaining his rationale for what he includes and excludes (and I agree with his thesis - it would be hard for me to explain how recursion or shell short changed the world, But public key encryption - not a problem). This explains the fundamental concepts and it does it in a clear way requiring no advanced mathematics etc. and for that I appreciate and applaud this book. I Have read Other explanations of these topic sand have not come aware with a clear an understanding as I obtained from reading this slim Volume. Many authors seem to be obsessed with showing you how clever they are and how well they understand a topic - rather than help you reach the same level of understanding.

One of the author's contributions is that the book mitigates not only the difficulties most CS starters experience when trying to grasp the idea behind wonderful codes, but also the fear that the discipline is for some gifted intellectuals. The author makes readers to explore more into other algorithms. This book was the first that makes me feel introducing to my homeland people by translating this into my mother language.",6

The book was that good. I have a background in economics and have recently become interested in computer science. MacCormick has a knack for capturing the essence of complicated ideas and explaining them clearly. At first, I felt like MacCormick was almost being too basic and redundant in his explanations. However, as he added more and more layers of complexity I came to appreciate his approach. In particular, I enjoyed the chapters on public key cryptography, digital signatures, and compression. The book is also very well written. Can't recommend it enough.",3

These concepts were taught to me back in uni but not in this very fun and thought provoking style the author has depicted in his piece of writing. Loved every part of it and the way he had targeted the laymen who will be reading this as well but at the same time not to keep the people who do come from an IT background bored he gives just the little bit of the technical side of it as well.

And most importantly, he does it in a way which makes it understandable for people without formal training in computer science. And even more importantly I think that even computer scientists should really use this book as a learning on how to present complex mathematical ideas with simple examples which almost anyone can understand.

algo41,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future: The Ingenious Ideas That Drive Today's Computers,extraordinary,"What is extraordinary about this book is how cleverly MacCormick explains potentially difficult material. He uses layered, concrete examples, each adding more complexity until the reader can appreciate how some of the important software tasks, such as search, are accomplished.

I wish the chapter on pattern recognition had been expanded, or an additional chapter written on artificial intelligence, as it is so important to the future, and so interesting. I would have delayed the ""Public Key Cryptography"" chapter so that it came after ""Data Bases"", since cryptography is relatively technical; at the same time, the use of the paint mixture analogy to explain the public key idea was brilliantly illuminating, as commented on by a previous reviewer.",3
Oliver J Reeves,3.0 out of 5 stars,Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future: The Ingenious Ideas That Drive Today's Computers,"Good for those new to the field, a little drab for geeks","The book was enjoyable but did in many ways feel like a father trying to explain things to his toddler. The style of the book felt unnecessarily ""soft"" given that the topic is Algorithms. Even the pictures that were used seem almost childlike. Some of the chosen algorithms were interesting, some were a little boring. The last chapter on what is computable was way too long and mostly uninteresting. Having said that, for those who have never before experienced, or had exposure to, algorithms and/or the science of computing there is something to be found here.

The Kindle version wasn't really up to scratch. For example big chunks of chapter 10 were centered rather than justified making it surprisingly hard to read and the imagery was almost impossible to digest in some points. I'm sure the experience of the physical copy would be better.

On the whole, not a bad read, but not recommended for geeks who already have a background in algorithms.",29

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future: The Ingenious Ideas That Drive Today's Computers,"Great book, but not complete....","Great book. Good for showing young people that computers can do more than just play games and access facebook.

Written on VERY elementary level, rather not for professional but for complete amateur. Good as a basis for popular lectures, on K-12 level.

However, selection of ""great"" algorithms is a bit arbitraty and limited. Some GREAT algorithms are missing:

1. FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). This is the bridge bewteen analog world and digital world. Without FFT would be no digital communications, digital music and modern cell phones

2. Kalman Filter. Algorithm for extracting useful signal from noise. Without Kalman Filter would be no space ships, telecommunication satellites and car computers

3. Linear Programming. How to make optimal decisions. This is the tool that makes economy efficient, controls manufacturing and transportation

Conceptually, these algorithms are a bit more complex than ones described in the book - some mathematics is needed to present these algorithms. But experience shows that elementary presentation is possible. In addition, these algorithms show that MATHEMATICS is the basis for great algorithms. This simple fact is not understood by young peopole who associate great algorithm with nothing more than programming in Java. And this simple fact is not sufficiently visible from the book",50
Geoff Puterbaugh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future: The Ingenious Ideas That Drive Today's Computers,A book for programmers,"Truth in Reviewing: I worked at developing system software for 25 years.

I can't imagine that this book would be interesting for those working outside the field of software development. Even for those working as programmers, there is always the option of ""auto-drive."" That is to say, there is no need at all to understand these algorithms, which always come in bundles. I say ""auto-drive"" because of the parallel between driving a car and being a car mechanic. Most of us simply start the car and drive off, which is how almost all programmers treat these algorithms: data compression, public-key cryptography, etc. If a programmer has to deal with these things, he will undoubtedly be supplied with a package, which is completely happy with calls such as ""ENCODE(MyPassword)"" and ""DECODE(MyMessage).""

This is not to suggest that these algorithms are not brilliant. It is more to suggest that the millions of people using digital cameras have absolutely no clue about the algorithms supporting the JPG format -- nor do they need to. People who want to exchange private messages can use PGP without understanding the algorithms supporting public-key cryptography. (I don't understand them either, and this book did not help. It's very advanced math, folks, and I stopped after Algebra I.)

BUT if you work as a programmer, you might want to buy this book, along with the more serious books about computer algorithms. The classics were written by Knuth.",2

Proofs in the book are very lucid and avoid common mathematical textbook proof cop-outs (""Proof is left to the reader"", ""proof is simple when X is viewed as a Continuous Brownian Bridge"").

William Schreiber,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning Robotics using Python,"Misleading title, but excellent robotics book","The title of this book is misleading. Yes, there is python in the book and the examples are written in python, but the book is really about how to take existing technology and build an advanced robot at a price most hobbyists could probably afford. Most of us build a line follower, a light avoider, a robot that bounces off walls and then randomly turns etc, but moving to that next step of building a robot that knows where it is and can find its way back (SLAM algorithm) is something else most builders never get to since it is a hard nut to crack. He gives a blue print for an advanced robot which can be built for well under a $1000 and uses ROS (robot operating system), PCL, a Kinect, IMU, ultrasonic sensor ARM processor etc.

He takes all the pieces that are out there and shows you how to integrate them all into an advanced robot. It wasn't what I expected from the book but I was pleasantly surprised since it was exactly what I need to get myself to that advanced robot I really want to build.

Warning, that the directions may be out of date (it is predicated on an older version of ROS) and you will need to use the internet and/or other resources to do all of the things he documents. It is still worth every penny",15
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Learning Robotics using Python,Suitable for intermediate/advance robotic enthusiasts,"I wanted to rate this as 3.5 stars, but Amazon seems to restrict the stars to whole numbers. Now to the review.
The author obviously knows the subject but I found it difficult to follow all the steps when in particular section. For instance, using Gazebo for robotic simulation, the author shifts between the turtlebot and chefbot without clear and precise directions. There are also missing steps in the process, where I had to figure out how to get to an end goal. This is frustrating and will surely turn-off many readers. It kind of reminded me of some my old engineering undergrad texts where the author left you high and try with a statement like ""It is left to the reader to complete the derivation...""

The editing also needs improvement. The grammar is stifled and it appears that English is a second language to the author. If not, the author really should get a much better copy editor.

I would consider this book to be appropriate for intermediate or advanced robotic enthusiasts; definitely not for beginners.

William P Ross,4.0 out of 5 stars,Predictive Analytics and Data Mining: Concepts and Practice with RapidMiner,Well Designed Book On Data Mining and Predictions,"This book does a nice job of explaining data mining concepts and predictive analytics. The main tool software tool they use is RapidMiner. Curiously RapidMiner was only introduced in chapter 13, the last chapter, although the authors mention you may want to read this chapter first.

Some aspects of this book are done really nicely, like when they explain the Iris data set, which is a famous data set of flowers. There is a diagram (pg. 39) in the book showing the flower, and which labels showing which part of the flower is sepal length and which is petal length. I was familiar with the Iris data set before this book, but the diagram taught me what the sepal length meant exactly.

There are lots of diagrams throughout the book which show different ways to visualize data and most concepts have clear explanations. The balance was reasonable between explaining techniques and showing how they are used.

I would have liked to see more application of some of the concepts and RapidMiner specifically. Overall, this book does a good job of explaining the concepts and techniques of data mining.",3

I'm sure experienced data analysts will also appreciate the deep knowledge and experience the authors bring to the subject, and will ;find new, different and better ways to tackle some thorny problems.

Casper Chauncey,4.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Computer Vision with Python: Tools and algorithms for analyzing images,High information density,"This book has a LOT of information packed into a small space, especially if you are new to computer vision and/or the math involved. I have found myself spending several days studying a single page, which includes looking up terms, checking Wikipedia etc. for more details, or trying out the code examples.

I guess that could be good or bad depending on how much work you're willing to do. For me it has been, overall, good.

Two things I don't like: the examples and the printing.

The examples: Many computer books either come with a CD that has the code examples on it, or gives a link to a website. Not this one. You have to hand type the code examples which may be 10 to 50 lines. Also the sample images don't seem to be available so you can't replicate the book's results.

The printing: For a topic like vision, with many sample photos throughout, color would seem to be important. But this book is printed in black and white. What's worse, many of the pages seem to have been systematically smudged. I don't know if this is unique to my copy, but many of the pages seem to be marked with a circular smear that seems to have been made while the ink was still damp. There may be several such smears on a single page, some of then smudging the images that are purportedly showing you the result of the latest image manipulation technique. To say this reduces the value of the example is an understatement.

So I guess I would give the author a 5 (best rating) and the printer or publisher a 2.",4

Unfortunately, there are a few nagging elements that detract from the beginner's experience.

For example, new terms such as ""eigenvectors"" are introduced in Chapter 1 without a description of what they mean. Example code is sometimes split up into sections, interspersed with the text, making it more difficult to type in. The small font size also tends to be a bit of a distraction.

According to the back cover, ""This book is ideal for...enthusiasts with basic programming and standard mathematical skills."" I'm a programmer and use Python at work, and am an ""enthusiast"" but have no prior CV experience.

Rusty,5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence for Games,Excellent and approachable,"The vast majority of software development books, whether it be for line-of-business app dev or game development, seem to have little to no information that can be found via a casual internet search.

This book is one of the few exceptions. There is a refreshing breadth and depth of game AI knowledge in this book that has been of tremendous help. Unlike the common ""Gems"" series of books, this book contains enough information on nearly every topic for the reader to build a 'ground up' implementation of their own.

My only complaints are that the pseudocode seems to be overly simplified and not as easily converted to a concrete implementation as I'd like, and that even for a book on game-specific AI implementations, the authors seem to enjoy a bit more of an academic/idealized approach to the design. That might be less bothersome to a professional game developer, but I'm at the hobbyist/indie level, and sometimes need a quick-and-dirty implementation before I begin to really understand what's going on.

In some cases, this means choosing a simpler (and more limited) technique over a fancier one.

I have a couple of small gripes with the book: the pseudocode contains a number of errors (e.g., an incorrect sign or off-by-one error), and the section on neural networks failed to fully convey how useless these really are. But on the whole, it was a great read, with real value on every page. If you're thinking about writing AI for any game, you should start with this book.",3

E. Kontsevoy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition),Highly recommended,"I am half way through and I like it so far. Frankly I am puzzled by other reviewers complaining about ""lack of real code examples"", they clearly have not read the book carefully: it comes with tons of sample code (online) written in different languages, publishers/authors simply did not want to waste the precious real estate. The book is nearly a thousand pages already.

Otherwise this is a great CS book. Yes there is some math in it, but don't be scared - there is an appendix with all necessary mathematical background you'll need (and you don't need much). I was surprised to see so much historical references in this book, it teaches you not just about most major branches of AI, but also about how they started and where originated from in a ""problem -> solution"" form. For instance when they talk about genetic algorithms they actually go ahead and write a comprehensive comparison of analogies between biological evolution, genes and their computer-generated counterparts referencing the original work of Darwin and others.

If you're into AI, applied mathematics or computer science, I have no doubt you'll enjoy this book: it's not too focused on something specific (and something you'd need a PhD to understand) while not too shallow and covers fairly wide spectrum of AI problems, including (!) ethical and philosophical issues like ""what happens if we succeed?""

Highly recommended.",6
B1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition),Worth a million,"An author of this book is said to have commented that its writing has made him a millionaire. It is used in over 1000 universities for a simple reason, it is good. The book uses the concept of an agent to unify the formerly fragmented field of AI and to link together concepts as diverse as logic programming and ethics. It is very easy to read and touches every area of modern research interest I can think of. The problems have a nice variety of difficulties (although there are no worked-out solutions in the book) and provide a mix between theory and practice, introducing the careful student to concepts and papers not developed in the main text of the chapter. The bibliography is well laid-out and provides useful depth (one of my current research interests was sparked by reading one of the referenced papers in the 2nd chapter).

My only complaint so far (not having finished the entire book) is that some of the definitions in chapter 17's whirlwind introduction to game theory were a little vague. But, a quick look at some other sources clarified things immensely.

It is rare to find a textbook as interesting and clear as this one. If a professor is requiring that you read it, consider yourself fortunate. If you are thinking of reading it yourself, you also are blessed. Look forward to many pleasant evenings.",5

It would also be nice if it had a ""recommended reading"" page, listing those texts that would be useful for an AI beginner to review in order to understand the math and logic referred to.

J. Bosch,3.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition),"Could have been great, but ...","As some reviewers have said, this is probably the most comprehensive AI textbook on the market. The ""pros"" of the book have been covered pretty well by other reviewers, so I'll limit my review to some of the things that bug me about the book.

1. No answer key for any problems. This feature has been standard in textbooks for decades as a way for students to self-check their understanding of the material.

2. Examples are scant and sometimes stop in the middle. For example, in Chapter 13, the example of applying Bayes' Rule gives one approach and indicates that it will discuss an alternative approach, but then the text just goes off on another path and never completes the example.

3. Inconsistent and (sometimes) convoluted pseudocode for the algorithms. Pseudocode should be a fairly-close-to-English approximation of the algorithm, but this book seems to mix RTL, English, and any other notation. Though the appendix includes an attempt at explaining their rationale behind their own brand of pseudocode, it's incomplete at best. Also, the function names don't follow any convention I've ever seen (I have 30+ years experience in software), and aren't even consistent within the book.

4. Condescending language. This should never occur in a textbook. In far too many places, the authors tell us that ""the sharp-eyed reader will have noticed"" or similar phrases, which basically implies, ""if you didn't get our explanation and find the hidden subtext, you are not sharp-eyed"". All such language should have been edited out.

The authors came so close to writing a classic, but sadly missed the mark. I think that any professors who claim that their students ""universally love this book"" are deluding themselves. Still, if your professor is good at explicating the material, it's worth going through it once, then switching to other materials, maybe primary source materials in the subfield(s) that grab your interest.",12

Toren,2.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition),Disappointing...,"Following the accolades in the reviews and having a keen interest in AI (as a physician and computer scientist) - I have dived into this book. It took me more than half a year of stubbornly trying to read and understand it. What a disappointment...
On one hand, the math is inaccessible, least you have a major in computer sciences / statistics, math - or all of the above. It seems some, if not all of the math ""proofs"" are unnecessary for the matter at hand. Unless there are some sinister motives behind these superfluous math complications - such as providing professors with ammunition for students testing. But why should someone interested in AI - get bogged down in this? Is it really what the authors had in mind?
On the other hand there are not enough examples to follow and the examples that are there - are inconsistent and insufficient (for example: the `wumpus' world that is used in the logic chapters, actually succeeds to stir an interest in the reader and then ....it is not followed up in the subsequent chapters such as the one on Bayesian networks)...
Some easy to grasp principles (such as basic propositional logic) are repeated ad nauseam while some difficult subjects (such as MCMC) are left as puzzling axioms, for us to decipher on our own.

I summarize my disappointment asking myself what I got from this effort that I have invested into this book, absorption and digestion wise, professionally speaking:
1. Did this book help me better understand the depth and breadth of the AI domain? - No.
2. Am I able to develop, even conceptually a plan for an AI application / ""intelligent agent""? Absolutely not.
3. Did the book clarify for me the fields of logic, machine learning, reasoning, uncertainty, probability and so on? - No. I am as confused now as I was before embarking on this study project, maybe even more so.
4. Am I a smarter person, able to read now the multitude of scientific articles out there on the AI subject - after finishing this book? - No.

The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of the single one it deserves - is because of the historical and bibliographical summaries the authors have nicely detailed at the end of each chapter. I've seen other books recommended in these reviews - and I intend to look into them shortly. CAVEAT EMPTOR (buyer beware) !",11

Acesion,5.0 out of 5 stars,Essentials Of Discrete Mathematics,Simple and clear.,I used this book for two logic courses. The book is laid out in a straightforward logical(I would expect as much from such a book) fashion. You should be able to go from the first to the last chapter without a need to jump around to connect concepts as they simply build upon one another. Each chapter is also self contained meaning that if you only wanted to learn about graph theory you could skip to that section and read it and be able to understand it without needing to consult other chapters which is nice when you take a semester break between logic courses. The best part are the problem sections which the book provides detailed answers for. Unlike most math books which only detail a few steps or simply give you an answer to reference this book will actually lead you through the process of solving the problems which is immensely helpful.,13

Emotions are not exclusive to humans; even a feral pet cat Lucy (described briefly in 'Humbling and Humility'), without the thought capacity of an expanded pre-frontal cortex, manifests and communicates all sorts of emotions including displeasure when one does not open a door soon enough for her.

Steven K,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind",Excellent book on thinking machines - but misleading title,"I agree with the reviewer who noted how odd it was that a book titled ""The Emotion Machine"" does not discuss Joseph LeDoux, even if only to refute him. But I think that the problem is with the title, not the book. I found many of Minsky's insights very helpful - it is a very good book about how machines think. And if you are not a dualist, then those insights apply to people too. The book is very well organized and clearly written, and helps you think about thinking. I especially enjoyed his discussion of qualia (although he does not use the term), and why he thinks it is not quite the problem that so many philosophers want to make it.

Minsky's main take on emotions is that emotional states are not fundamentally different from other types of thinking, and that the entire dicotomy of rationality v. emotion is misleading. He prefers to view them all as different ways of thinking - of utilizing various mental resources at one's disposal, some conscious and some not. He organizes his discussion of difficult material very well, but I wish there was more grounding in the underlying neural anatomy of human emotion.",34
Karl I. Nordling,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind",No aha experience,"I bought this book thinking it would have something to do with endowing AI systems with feelings, which seemed like it could be fascinating read. What I found however was a book that did its level best to drain anything as interesting as feelings out of the text and instead used a method of slicing the operation of the human mind down into trivially simple processes, or what the author calls resources, such as IF ..DO rules that specify what do in response to some stimulus, Selectors which choose among possible response, Critics which are built to recognize certain conditions. There are also instinctive reactions such as hunger, fear, and anger which operate at a lower level. The author's contention is that ""suitcase words"" like emotion, conscience, consciousness are hard to understand and explain because we pack too many different ideas into them, therefor we need dissect them into simpler single-purpose processes, the combinations and interactions of which we can then describe more intelligently and fruitfully. Applying this approach to the hard problem of consciousness he writes that ""the sensation of seeing something red"" could be demystified if we were able to make observations like the following about the lower level operations in the brain: ""My resources have classified certain stimuli, and then made some representations of my situation, and some of my Critics changed certain plans I had made, and altered some ways in which I was perceiving things, and this led to the following sorts of cascades, and so forth."" This emphasis of breaking mental operations down into smaller chunks obviously comes from the experiences and practices of Artificial Intelligence researchers where starting with simple primitives and combining them into more complex layers is probably the only feasible approach. However, for this reader the method has the disadvantage that it makes the story exceedingly dry and non-illuminating. Sure, I see how you can talk about ""consciousness detecting critics"" which recognize certain processes and then send signals other parts of the brain which would enable your language system to articulate your condition with words like conscious, aware, I am seeing red. But that doesn't give me any aha experience of understanding. I still don't know if Professor Minsky's red looks like my red.",2

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind",An effective critic-selector of AI research,"Progress in the design and creation of intelligent machines has been steady for the last four decades and at times has exhibited sharp peaks in both advances and applications. This progress has gone relatively unnoticed, or has been trivialized by the very individuals who have been responsible for it. The field of artificial intelligence has been peculiar in that regard: every advance is hailed as major at the time of its inception, but after a very short time it is delegated to the archives as being ""trivial"" or ""not truly intelligent."" It is unknown why this pattern always occurs, but it might be due to the willingness of researchers to engage in philosophical debate on the nature of mind and the possibility, or impossibility, of thinking machines. By indulging in such debates, researchers waste precious time that is better used dealing with the actual building of these machines or the development of algorithms or reasoning patterns by which these machines can solve problems of both theoretical and practical interest. Also, philosophical musings on artificial intelligence, due to the huge conceptual spaces in which they wander aimlessly, are usually of no help in pointing to the right direction for researchers to follow. What researchers need is a ""director"" or ""set of directors"" that are familiar with the subject matter, have both applied and theoretical experience in the field of artificial intelligence, and that eschew philosophical armchair speculation in favor of realistic dialog about the nature and functioning of intelligent machines.

The author of this book has been one of these ""directors"" throughout his professional career, and even though some of his writings have a speculative air about them, many others have been very useful as guidance to those working in the trenches of artificial intelligence. One can point to the author's writings as both inspiration and as a source of perspiration, the latter arising because of the difficulty in bringing some of his ideas to fruition. It would be incorrect to state that the author's ideas have played a predominant role in the field of artificial intelligence, but his influence has been real, if sometimes even in the negative, such as his commentary on the role of perceptrons.

There are intelligent machines today, and they have wide application in business and finance, but their intelligence is restricted (but highly effective) to certain domains of applicability. There are machines for example that can play superb chess and backgammon, being competitive with the best human players in this regard, but these machines, and the reasoning patterns they use in chess and backgammon cannot without major modification indulge themselves in performing financial prediction or proving difficult theorems in mathematics. The building of intelligent machines that can think in multiple domains is at present one of the most difficult outstanding problems in artificial intelligence. Some progress is being made, but it has been stymied again by overindulgence in philosophical speculation and rancorous debates on the nature of mind and whether or not machines can have true emotions.

Humans can of course think in multiple domains. Indeed, a good human chess player can also be a good mathematician or a good chef. The ability to think in multiple domains has been christened as ""commonsense"" by many psychologists and professional educators, and those skeptical of the possibility of machine intelligence. It is thought by many that in order for a machine to be considered as truly intelligent, or even indeed to possess any intelligence at all, it must possess ""commonsense"", in spite of the vague manner in which this concept is frequently presented in both the popular and scientific literature.

The nature of ""commonsense"" is explored in an atypical manner in this book, and in this regard the author again shows his ability to think outside of the box and phrase issues in a new light. This is not to say that advice on how to implement these ideas in real machines is included in the book, as it is not. But the ideas do seem plausible as well as practical, particularly the concept of a ""panalogy"", which is the author's contraction of the two words ""parallel analogy"". A panalogy allows a machine (human or otherwise) to give multiple meanings to an object, event, or situation, and thus be able to discern whether a particular interpretation of an event is inappropriate. A machine good in the game of chess could possibly then give multiple interpretations to its moves, some of which may happen to be similar to the interpretations given to a musical composition for example. The machine could thus use its expertise in chess to write musical compositions, and therefore be able to think in multiple domains. On the other hand, the machine may realize that there are no such analogies between chess and musical composition, and thus refrain from attempting to gain expertise in the latter. Another role for pananalogies, which may be a fruitful one, is that they can be used to measure to what degree interpretations are ""entangled"" with each other. Intepretations, which are the results of thinking, algorithmic processing, or reasoning patterns as it were, could be entangled in the sense that they always refer to objects, events, or situations in multiple domains. A panalogy, being a collection of interpretations in one domain, could be entangled with another in a different domain. The machine could thus switch between these with great ease, and thus be effective in both domains. It remains of course to construct explicit examples of panalogies that can be implemented in a real machine. The author does not direct the reader on how to do this, unfortunately.

The author also discusses a few other topics that have been hotly debated in artificial intelligence, throughout its five-decade long history, namely the possibility of a conscious machine or one that displays (and feels!) genuine emotions. The nature of consciousness, even in the human case, is poorly understood, so any discussion of its implementation in machines must wait further clarification and elucidation. Contemporary research in neuroscience is giving assistance in this regard. The author though takes another view of consciousness, which departs from the ""folk psychology"" that this concept is typically embedded in. His view of consciousness is more process-oriented, in that consciousness is the result of more than twenty processes going on in the human brain. An entire chapter is spent elaborating on this view, which is highly interesting to read but of course needs to be connected with what is known in cognitive neuroscience.

It remains to be seen whether the ideas in this book can be implemented in real machines. If the author's views on emotions, commonsense, and consciousness are correct, as detailed throughout the book, it seems more plausible that machines will arise in the next few years that have these characteristics. If not, then perhaps machine intelligence should be viewed as something that is completely different from the human case. The fact that hundreds of tasks are now being done by machines that used to be thought of as the sole province of humans says a lot about the degree to which machine intelligence has progressed. Whenever the first machines are constructed to operate and reason in many in different domains, it seems likely that they will have their own ideas about how to direct further progress. Their understanding of ideas and issues may perhaps be very different than what humans is, and they may in fact serve as directors for further human advancement in different fields and contexts, much like the author has done throughout a major portion of his life.",35
Robert Jones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind",A Review of Minsky's THE EMOTION MACHINE,"Anyone working on cognitive systems will want

this book in their library. In reviewing THE EMOTION

MACHINE there are two lines of criticism that seem

important. Firstly, with the behaviorists I would

argue that introspection is both frequently inaccurate

and unscientific. Secondly, and more significantly,

most of Minsky's theories have not been developed to

the level of detail needed in order to formulate

actual algorithms. (To be fair there is Riecken's

""M system"" (in SOFTWARE AGENTS, J. M. Bradshaw, Ed.,

MIT Press, 1997) and Singh's thesis (EM-ONE, PhD

thesis, MIT, June 2005) which are at least a start in

that direction.)

On the positive side I am in general agreement

with Minsky that thought can be decomposed into

subroutines like:

remembering (search)

generalization

comparison

explanation

deduction

organization

induction

classification

concept formation

image manipulation

feature detection

analogy

compression

simulation

value assessment

My list appears in Asa H: A hierarchical architecture

for software agents (Transactions of the Kansas

Academy of Science, vol. 109, No. 3/4, 2006). Minsky

calls these ""ways to think"" and a partial list

appears on pages 226-228 of THE EMOTION MACHINE.

what Minsky is looking for.",24

Ashutosh S. Jogalekar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Molecular Modelling: Principles and Applications (2nd Edition),Comprehensive and self-contained,"In this book, Andrew Leach has done a great job in describing almost every important concept, sundry as well as significant, from the field of computational chemistry and molecular modeling. From basic but very useful topics like atom types, Z matrices, and force field parametrization, to advanced ones like Ewald Sums and Low Mode Monte Carlo conformational searching, Leach gives due importance to everything. The discussions on quantum mechanics in the first few chapters are moderate on the mathematics without shying away from it, and provide just the right amount of detail. Later chapters cover the whole gamut of computational techniques, from molecular dynamics and molecular mechanics, to molecular similarity and QSAR. Examples that are relevant in chemistry and biology are scattered throughout the book and illustrate every key idea. There are many good books for computational chemistry and molecular modeling, and some are good for a few topics, others for other ones.

When the book was recommended to me, a colleague cautioned, ""the only problem with the Leach book is how it communicates a superficial clarity--don't be mistaken in thinking you really understand the guts of the problem just because Leach communicates it so well.""

sheep or goat,5.0 out of 5 stars,Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition (Advanced Texts in Econometrics),"a little dated, but a good introduction","Great introduction to simple neural networks. It only covers feed-forward networks and not recurrent networks, so you don't get a full feel for the breadth of the neural networks field. Being from the early 1990's, it also doesn't cover any of the more recent advances in deep learning, which is a hot, and fascinating field. That being said, by focusing only on feedforward networks, the book has more time to develop the background (the first chapter is a basics statistics overview) and theory for why neural networks are powerful. It then builds up neural networks (from single layer networks to multilayer networks), and finally covers more practical aspects of using neural networks, such as training algorithms, choosing error functions, and how to use neural networks in a Bayesian setting. Its treatment of training algorithms (especially back propagation and the hessian equivalent of back propagation) is especially succinct and enlightening.

Overall, it's a great introduction to neural networks, and will allow you to dive into more modern treatments of neural networks, such as deep learning.",5
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition (Advanced Texts in Econometrics),An excellent introduction to pattern recognition,"Do not be put off by the title: this book is more about pattern recognition than neural networks.

T. Wiedman,4.0 out of 5 stars,Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition (Advanced Texts in Econometrics),Only for an expert,"Mr Bishop's book is very well written and contains a lot of useful information on neural networks. It is outlined well and progresses in a logical form. If, however, you are looking for a book that gives discussions with concrete examples of neural networks applications or set ups, you will be sorely disappointed. The mathematical treatment is universally generalized with very few specific concrete examples shown. Even the exercises will not serve you well. The term 'graded' is used; however, that simply referes to the description of difficulty. There are no answers to these exercises, so unless you have a teacher or are already firmly familiar with the material, you will not know if you have completed them correctly or not. Even worse, the exercises are in general not written to reinforce concepts in the chapter, but in most cases extend the chapter material into new regions.

In summary, this book should only be purchased by someone already familiar with neural networks and their mathematical basis. Anyone else will be wasting their money.",15

John,1.0 out of 5 stars,Neural Networks and Learning Machines (3rd Edition),Absolutely terrible textbook,"This book is absolutely terrible. It is being used as a graduate level text in neural networks and it is perhaps one of the most abysmally written textbooks ever. The chapter problems are completely out of scope given the material presented and even the solutions manual is poorly written, incomplete, and presented with little or no explanation at all. Many of the solutions do not even answer the questions that they are associated with. The text relies very heavily on esoteric mathematics that are not even remotely explained nor are references even provided to provide foundation. Very few examples are provided throughout the text and the material is nearly impossible to follow.",3
Mathew S Anderson,2.0 out of 5 stars,Neural Networks and Learning Machines (3rd Edition),Beginners: Just read the references,"This book reads like an angry TA's notebook with no regard for the reader understanding the contents (full of ""…it is obvious that…"" and ""…it follows that…""). I found myself wishing I could raise my hand to ask to explain the examples! In many situations the author brings in seemingly random theorems, attempts to tie them together, and then goes on to use the result without any rigorous proof of the underlying math or the theorems true applicability. It almost feels like the author is begging the question. I understand that, given the breadth of the literature covered, only so much can be said for each topic but the praise this book receives is quite undeserved.

Haykin uses the XOR problem as an example ad nauseam. I realize it's a canonical ANN classification problem; however in later chapters, it's annoying and frustrating when an ANN gets explained in such simple terms but a more complicated classification problem gets a paragraph or two and then a bunch of pictures with no explanation of how to derive the ANN to solve the problem. Detail a ""real"" problem, or just drop the examples because I can make graphs myself!

Couple this book with a poor lecturer and a student is likely to never pursue ANNs again. The only value I have found in this book is the extensive bibliography. I recommend finding a website that has grouped all Biblio references per chapter and then start hunting down the source articles. You will have to do this anyway to keep up with the author.",11
Lewis Cawthorne,3.0 out of 5 stars,Neural Networks and Learning Machines (3rd Edition),Not bad on the topic,"Haykin is a well known author in this subspecialty and the content of the book seems fine, but it hasn't been updated much from the 2nd edition despite progress in the field. I did fine in a course using the book entirely off a 2nd edition copy and kept this 3e text mostly closed for resale value. The only things I had to note were In chapter 2 it has some updates largely regarding the prevailing Bayesian views and in chapter 8 the problems expanded (old 8.06 is 8.10). As far as presentation, things were done well if sometimes dry (the latter likely because this isn't my area). The required mathematics is presented without tedious re-explanation, but if you aren't prepared for it you might not understand much.",6

A MATLAB CD is available, but only to professors who adopt the book for teaching. This approach will dramatically reduce the popularity of this book. First off, the reader/purchaser would have to already have extensive expertise in the subject matter (I really like the Kalman Filter coverage). Next, in order to put any of this mathematically-intense exposition into practice, the reader must be quite fluent in some scientific programming language.

Without an accompanying MATLAB CD, this great book remains no more than an expensive paperweight.

Joanna D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couscous and Other Good Food from Morocco,Moroccan food as explained by a top-notch food writer,"Paula Wolfert is a recognized food author. She brings her expertise and knowledge to the subject of Moroccan cuisine. Yes, you will get good recipes for Moroccan bread ( flat loaf made with semolina, but there's a barley variant), Bisteeya or ""Pastilla"" as our Marrakech chef spelled it--the filo dough sweet pie that is an improbable mix of chicken or pigeon, scrambled eggs, almond paste, sugar and cinnamon in a buttery, flaky pastry and the ubiquitous eggplant salad that starts every meal. She covers the tagines like chicken with preserved lemon and olives and tells you how to cook couscous rather than use the instant-in-the-box variety that has little character.

But I like the book for the descriptions of the souks in Fes and Marrakech. The twisting alleys of high walled-in buildings (no more than five stories tall) and their almost random arrangement conceal a confusion of very tempting spice shops, butcher shops, bakeries, even community ovens. They are really fun to explore and at least in Marrakech, as long as you keep the central square minaret tower in view, you can't really get lost. Yes, shopping in this kind of place is a lot more fun than poking down the supermarket aisles, wondering why a bottle of turmeric costs six bucks when it's pennies a bag in the Medina.

Fun for reading, and the recipes are also good.",2

I bought the book after returning from Morocco along with another Moroccan cookbook. While Ms. Wolfert's book does not have the beautiful glossy color photos like the other book, she includes a wealth of information about the culture, history and people of Morocco as well as very detailed, delicious recipies. Each one I have tried has come out better than the vast majority of the food I actually ate in Morocco! A warning to those looking for fast, easy recipies, however. Ms. Wolfert is clearly a perfectionist and a purist and does not include many short cuts or substitutions, and Moroccan food is the original ""slow food"". If you crave authenticity, are willing to follow her recipies closely, and willing spend many hours preparing the dishes, you'll be handsomely rewarded.",4

GeorgiaMommyPeach,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couscous and Other Good Food from Morocco,~A perfect addition to any Moroccan cooking library~,"I have developed a passion for Moroccan food and as a result, a curiosity for the history of its preparation.

I read it cover to cover, comparing how the many dishes were prepared from the author's perspective and how thirty-five years later I, in the United States, prepare many of the same dishes.

Paula Wolfert's passion and excitement for Moroccan cooking and its' people is infectious. It was interesting to read how the various dishes were prepared over thirty years ago, marveling at how many of the ingredients are almost commonplace in the U.S. today.

Although this cookbook is thirty-five years old and many of the recipes have been updated by more recent cookbooks, I still recommend this book highly. It is one of over a dozen books I have on Moroccan cooking and still has a place in the library of anyone who has a passion for Moroccan food.",3

There were a very few line drawings and no pictures of finished dishes. This book is not about couscous, it is about just about every other dish served in Morocco.

My daughter loves couscous and I bought this book hoping to find some good dishes that she would enjoy. Nothing could be further from the truth.

If you are looking of a compendium of Moroccan food and have time to sit and read this book from cover to cover, then this is your book. If you want something helpful in the kitchen, save you money.

The ability to understand how technology can be used to persuade people to behave in certain ways, to elicit behaviors, and that technology can be used as a tool, as a social actor or as a medium for information is pretty solid and ""timeless"" material. Where the book falls short today is that it was written nearly 12 years ago. Many of the technology elements have been addressed or surpassed.

However, he does not dismiss the darker uses of the technology and the very real ethical issues it raises. Towards the end of the book, he argues that studying computer-human persuasion can provide new insights into human-human persuasion, and the crossover in many of the principles discussed is readily apparent.

THE MAIN THING WAS TRANSCRIBING LETTERS OVER AND OVER. THE LATER CHAPTERS INCORPORATE A SMALL AMOUNT OF LEGAL AND MEDICAL DOCUMENTS AND THE LATER CHAPTERS USE HARDER ACCENTS AND FOREIGN ACCENTS.

I WOULDN'T SUGGEST USING THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU ARE TAKING THE COLLEGE COURSE BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR GONNA GET THIS BOOK AND DO IT AND THEN GO OUT AND GET A JOB TRANSCRIBING.

IN SHORT ITS BASICALLY JUST TYPING WHAT YOU HEAR, SO IF YOU ARE WANTING TO GET THIS BOOK JUST TO PRACTICE OR SOMETHING I WOULD SUGGEST TYPING WHAT YOU HEAR WHILE YOU WATCH TV OR SOMETHING.",2
Chauncey Bell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Understanding Computers and Cognition: A New Foundation for Design,Not Just Another Pretty Face,"A few years ago Byte Magazine named this one of the 10 most important books in the history of the computer industry. Flores was asked to keynote the 50th anniversary meeting of the ACM on the strength of the work he has done, some of which is shown here.
I am a little surprised not to find a review here that shows awareness of what this book is and was intended to do -- to turn those concerned with the design of the role of computers in society into a new direction. The book offers a fundamental enrichment and extension to the traditional engineering-based foundations that are used for designing computer systems that is drawn from philosophy and biology. It opens the development of a rigorous new design milleau to the reader. This is NOT yet another multi-disciplinary rumination.
I would say this is not a ""helpful"" book, and it was never intended as an easy read. It is a book to turn to when one has learned enough about what is really at issue in putting computers to work in human life to discover that the likes of input, process, output, ""friendly"" interfaces, attractive graphical presentations, and logical flow charts are vastly insufficient distinctions for doing work that really makes a contribution to your clients and colleagues. The book challenges the reader strongly, and is not simple to read. I guess that the best way to read it is with someone else, having discussions as you go along.
This is a book to engage and grow with -- a must-read for those serious about designing and building systems that will affect the lives of those who engage with them.",62
Brady Uselman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Understanding Computers and Cognition: A New Foundation for Design,"Wonderful Read, way ahead of its time",In completely enjoyed this book. For starters it takes a lot of Heidegger's work and makes it completely accessible. The book laid out well where AI can and cannot go based on these Heidegarian (sp?) principals.

C. Daniel Andrade,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, & the Economic World",One of the mind-blowing cultural products of our time that points to a possible great future,"Those who have watched the Matrix trilogy a lot of times or those who have loved seeing Kevin Kelly at TED: you guys should really read this book. It starts with a startling description of a situation where people and their environment are a synthesis of natural, organic and technological stuff. The whole book is high-quality food for people hungry for a reflective dive into the pros and cons of humanity's inevitable impulses towards new sophistication in intellectual and practical aspects of life without losing sight of the risks of such an adventure. We were born and we made things and grew others. How ready are we to transcend the distinction between making and growing and apply such a unified practice even to ourselves? This is one of the deep questions the book helps us deal with.",2
D. A. Ross,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, & the Economic World","Deep, insightful, and inspiring ... but could use an editor's touch","Don't let the fact that it took me 10 months to finish this book impact your decision to read it; Out of Control was a well-worthy, remarkable effort, which should be given a careful and thorough read.

So, why 10 months? Kevin Kelly is very wordy. Yes, Kelly provides fascinating insights and revelations about machine biology, ""hive mind"" theory, co-evolution, the evolution of computers, and the future of planet Earth. But he does all of this with about 200 pages more than are actually necessary to make his point. Kelly is a great writer, no doubt, but he tends to wander aimlessly, which makes these difficult topics challenging to understand. A good editor would have helped immensely.

Out of control also suffers from a lack of cohesion, and would be better served as a collection of separate essays about each topic, rather than a book that strives to espouse one overarching theme. As I was reading, I kept wondering where Kelly was going with all of his ideas, as a lack of drive seemed evident.

Lest you think I have nothing but ill contempt for this book, there is a payoff: Kelly is a brilliant soothsayer, of sorts. This book was written 16 years ago, so hindsight can readily be applied, and Kelly's predictions about where science would be with relation to computers, nanotechnology, pharmaceuticals, this crazy thing called the ""Internet"" he kept mentioning, have nearly all come to fruition. Does this mean machines and computers develop their own biology, and begin truly thinking for themselves, as Kelly suggests? Time will only tell.",3
Brian Kodi,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, & the Economic World",This Book Is Out of Control,"I must admit that I'm a little ticked at spending a considerable amount of time reading a 500 page book with too many ideas and lack of focus. The editing left a lot to be desired. Throughout the book, the author asserts that if dumb, simple things (e.g. a swarm of bees) continuously communicate with each other they will eventually become capable of performing highly complex tasks not feasible by the will of intelligent beings. Yet, this point is expressed in such a complex manner that it makes one wonder why the author didn't follow his philosophy by dumbing down his arguments and letting the plentiful explain the more difficult concepts.

The main premise of the book is the idea of intelligent beings, in this case humans, giving up control of their creations, which are machines, and letting them ""adapt on their own, evolve in their own direction, and grow without human oversight.""

There are some intriguing ideas such as: No sustaining ecosystem is in equilibrium or completely ""in control"". Some chaotic or ""out of control"" events are required for complex systems to function. For example, the earth's atmosphere is made up of 20% oxygen. This oxygen content is just enough to maintain viable ecosystems without burning up the earth from fires.

""Out of Control"" was written in 1994, and 14 years later global warming is a hot button. What happened to the Kelly's grand ideas of recycling (see example of Danish companies recycling each others' waste somewhere in the book)? How much closer are we to eco-friendly intelligent homes and personal belongings? Instead of moving to cheap renewable energy sources, we are experiencing the use of fossil fuels like never before with the fast growing economies of China and India. Crucial counteracting forces seemed to have been completely ignored by the author in projecting a sea of changes in how humans behave. Solar energy will never succeed as a viable energy source unless Big Oil has a monopoly over the sun. Digital cash has been a failure because its success would've destroyed the profits of Visa/Mastercard.

The author is a proponent of the idea of passing down learned behavior innately to offsprings, i.e. through genes. For example, experiments cited from one scientist proved evolution with learned behavior passed down to offsprings is superior to natural evolution. In this instance the author ignored the prospect of passing down negative and undesirable learned behavior that is criminal in nature for example. It's best that all offsprings are created much like computers, and most behavior is learned much like software. It is precisely individuality that facilitates variability, the hallmark of evolution. The author himself even argues for systems thriving at the edge of chaos; systems flexible enough to adapt to the changing environment, yet not rigid enough to become unadaptable. Passing down learned behavior to offsprings would undoubtedly create a more rigid system. Besides, most people already harbor the ill effects of bad parenting. The last thing they need is to acquire this cr*p at conception.

At the end of the book, Mr. Kelly mentions ""The Nine Laws of God"". One law in particular stood out: ""Grow by chunking"" which states ""The only way to make a complex system that works is to begin with a simple system that works. Attempts to instantly install highly complex organization-such as intelligence or a market economy-without growing it, inevitably lead to failure..... Time is needed to let each part test itself against all the others...."" The failure to observe this law has been aptly demonstrated in the U.S. effort to build democracy in Iraq, and to a lesser degree the pressure exerted on Russia by the west to quickly move to a market economy following the collapse of communism.

In spite of all the criticism, I'm glad I read this book. The ideas could have been expressed in 200 pages fewer and more coherently. Pick up a copy and fasten your seat belt. You will be riding this one for a while.",4
owookiee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, & the Economic World",Very thought-provoking,This is the best sciency book out of the two dozen or so I've read this year. He doesn't just beat you over the head with basic knowledge in one subject. His chapter topics range far and wide and give you enough to get you interested. I've been going through the bibliography to see what books I could read next to explore certain subjects deeper. There were a lot of surprising things I want to learn more about. Did you know the DOD had a desert-war computer simulation that played out the Gulf War before it happened? SimCity and Populous were born of genuine simulation research? Entire ecosystems have been surviving for years sealed in glass jars? This book is loaded.,2
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, & the Economic World",Interesting and provocative,"The ideas in this book may be thought by some to be radical or far-fetched, but to those readers familiar with the behavior of complex dynamical systems, they seem quite natural. The book emphasizes the theoretical aspects of complex systems, but some natural examples of them are discussed. The author, in spite of his choice of title for the book, is not threatened by the consequences of artifically creating these systems. After all, we live and have evolved in a universe that is even more complex than the author describes. The fact that we humans can now speed up the process of creation of these systems should be a source of wonder instead of fear.
What makes this book valuable reading is that the author emphasizes the collective behavior of dynamical systems. Too often the reductionist trend in Western science obscures how the system works together, how its many parts collectively induce an emergent behavior not at all apparent in the systems ""equations of motion"".
Since the book is written for a popular audience, the approach is qualitative and allegorical. This purely descriptive approach does however allow a more general overview of complex dynamical systems im many different areas. The author gives a fascinating discussion of swarm systems and their advantages and disadvantages. One of the disadvantages according to the author is that they are ""nonunderstandable""; but here he is mistaken, for complex systems can be understood, although such an understanding takes some effort anc computational horsepower. Also, in his discussion of network behavior the author asserts that it is ""counterintuitive"" and quotes ""Braess's paradox"" as proof of this. Dietrich Braess discovered that adding routes to an already congested network will slow it down. There are examples of this, but it is not a hard-and-fast rule, as network engineers who employ load balancing can attest to. Adding time-dependent paths can work to reduce congestion, this time-dependence not addressed in Braess's formulation of the paradox.
Some more interesting discussions in the book are allegorical, but they serve to encourage ""thinking out of the box"":1. The effects of isolation and boredom on the human mind: the need for the physical body to temper unruly constructions of the mind. 2. The chameleon riddle: what color will a chameleon take on if put in front of a mirror? 3.The Prisoner's dilemna. This has got to be the most widely used tool for encouraging cooperation, in spite of its simplicity and impracticality. Computer simulation of the Prisoner's dilemna with 1000 players has revealed phenomena familiar in evolutionary studies, such as parasitism, spontaneously emerging symbiosis, and long-term stable coexistence between species. 4. Physical systems as computational processes; this is the most radical of the ideas in the book, but the author does not expound upon it in any great detail though. 5. The Biosphere experiment; I only read brief news reports of this while it was going on, so it was interesting to read here a detailed account of it. 6. The need for industry to adopt ""biological"" methodologies: complexity is more efficient, less wasteful, and more robust. 7. Network economics: The ""network company"" of the 21st century will be distributed (no single location), decentralized, collaborative (outsourcing to competitors!), and adaptive. This chapter is the most practical of all those in the book. 8. The role of encryption in a digital economy, particularly ""encryption-metering"" and digital cash. 9. The importance of simulation in defense and industry in the 21st century: simulate before you build, simulate before you buy, and simulate before you fight. 10. The evolution machine and its resultant creation of sex; the consequent discussion of genetic/evolutionary programming. The differences between 'Lamarckian' and 'Darwinian"" evolutionary programs. 11. Postdarwinism: why have no new species been detected naturally or even in computer simulations? The central thesis of Neodarwinism is that only the environment can select mutations, but not induce or direct them.
Since this book was published in 1994, there have been many advances in the areas that the author discusses. Evolutionary programming has taken off, with many applications in finance, biology, network engineering, and large-scale circuit design. Swarm robots are currently under development, with deployment just years away. Computational/intelligent agents are now managing networks, with autonomous agents just around the corner.Encryption and smart-card technologies have mushroomed along with intelligent computer virus detection. Simulation is now thought of as a ""must-do"" in every phase of business and industry, and simulations are now thought of as sophisticated enough to model real-world situations without any experimental ""validation"". Indeed, technological advancement and its application is moving forward at a dizzying rate, and seemingly...out of control?",21

Kelly's cheerleading for the decentralized, ""hive-mind"" mentality smacks of the giddy 1940's Tomorrowland propaganda -- oblivious to market realities, people's resistance to change and the fact that simple technologies always win head-to-head competitions with more complex technologies. Yet he makes a valiant attempt to pull a Douglas Hofstadter, and write a ""Godel Escher Bach"" of future technologies. None of his examples or conclusions are original, but that doesn't diminish the cumulative power of his argument.",12
John Basso,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, & the Economic World",Forward thinking...,Out of Control is packed full of thought provoking ideas and ways of thinking.

Don't confuse this book with some fluffy marketing rant because it isn't!,1
Chris Anderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, & the Economic World",Perhaps the most important book of the 90s,"Why are the three most powerful forces in our world--evolution, democracy and capitalism--so controversial? Hundreds (in the case of democracy, thousands) of years after they were first understood, we still can't quite believe these three phenomena work. Socialist Europe resists capitalism, the religious right in America questions evolution and the Middle East makes a mockery of democracy. When you think about it, it's easy to understand why: all three are radically counterintuitive. ""One person, one vote?"" What if they vote wrong?

But that's the problem--we're thinking about it. Our brains aren't wired to understand the wisdom of the crowd. Evolution, democracy and capitalism don't work at the anecdotal level of personal experience, the level at which our story-driven synapses are built to engage. Instead, they're statistical, operating in the realm of collective probability. They're not right--they're ""righter"". They're not predictable and controllable--they're inherently out of control. That's scary and unsettling, but also hugely important to understand in a world of increasing complexity and diminishing institutional power (mainstream media: meet blogs; military: meet insurgency).

Fortunately, this book that makes sense of all of this. Out of Control was first published in 1994, well before its time, but it's one of those rare books that sells better each year it gets older. That's because Kelly recognized that the messy markets of natural selection, enlightened self-interest and invisible hands all anticipated the Internet and the delights of watching peer-to-peer cacophony create the greatest oracle the world has ever seen. Some of the examples may be a bit dated a dozen years later, but the message has only become more true: ""There is no central keeper of knowledge in a network, only curators of particular views,"" he writes. The emergent mob wisdom of the blogosphere and Wikipedia were unimaginable then, but somehow Kelly imagined them all the same. This may be the smartest book of the past decade.",42
S.

DbContext just works like magic with little or no explanation. That's fine, except when it DOESN'T work. Since you don't learn how it actually works, you don't learn how to fix issues. It either works, or it doesn't.

That's where this book comes in. It goes into just the right amount of detail about what is actually happening under the covers.

This book was helpful however it would help to have a reference in the back of the book to look up different topics. As far as I can tell it is the only book out there on EF5 and DbContext. I am currently working with EF5 on a project. After I completely implement the website using EF5 I will make a decision if I will ever use another ORM or not. I may go back to rolling my own SQL Stored Procedures, DAL, and BLL as I have done many times in the past which gives me more control and I fully understand the full data mapping. The only benefit to any ORM is time it should save to develop a project. Stored Procedures is the foundation anyway of any ORM plus it protects from injection. I have used other concepts from MS for data access and they were not bad but difficult to work with some times. I was trying to break up my project into layers and found it difficult with EF5 so I started over and put things into one project until I fully understand how to work with it better. I intend to breakup the project into layers later if I discover the need for scale-ability. Trying to implement repository pattern and unit of work is confusing since I have not tried those concepts in the past and also since EF is suppose to be doing that behind the scenes; it seems kind of redundant to implement some type of patterns if EF is already implementing a pattern. I like to use a DAL and a BLL. So EF should take the place of the DAL. I do like the concept of generating from the database plus update from the database. I am not sure any ORM will meet anyone's plug and play needs. The book is written to walk one through the concepts step by step but I tend to jump around technical books looking for instant answers to immediate problems. Mainly because I don't have the time to walk through a text book page by page I have projects to complete. I am not a full time developer so I look for quick answers to problems as I go along. I wish this book would give a fully layered example of using a DAL and BLL to also include a N-tier example with DAL and BLL. I rated this book 4 stars as it did give me some answers but it is the only book out there for EF5 using DbContext. I am using VS 2012 purposely for running EF5 and it is buggy. I spent many days with it crashing on me before I got it stable. I am in with VS 2012 for the long haul as it should get better.",1

As I have some background in differential geometry, and currently work with large sets of data, I find the marriage between machine learning and differential geometry very appealing. Having said this, the resulting ""information geometry"" seems to have very little new insight to offer. Standard concepts and methods of statistics / machine learning are dressed up and reformulated in the language of differential geometry (with some effort), leading to new vocabulary but no new practically applicable methods and algorithms. Deep concepts of geometry such as that of the curvature or geodesic do not seem to translate into equally powerful concepts for data analysis.

David,4.0 out of 5 stars,All of Nonparametric Statistics (Springer Texts in Statistics),Covers modern material but without code support,"I've read about 75% of this book, quitting near the end where the material was of less interest to me. I found this book to be largely focused the theory of nonparametrics with examples. The most important aspect of the book relative to others is that it teaches where each of the methods comes from in a rigorous fashion, i.e. it provides a wonderful base in theory of modern nonparametric methods.

On the other hand, those who want to actually apply the methods will be at a bit of a loss unless they are comfortable with scavenging CRAN for the proper functions/packages for the methods (and are successful at picking good packages). Or if you want to reinvent the wheel, that also works. I was disappointed in the practical aspect of the book in applying the methods. In the book preface, it says ""data sets and code may be found at [web address]""... there is data but no code there (as of 8/17/09). At the very least, suggest package/functions in R (or some software)! Just the package/function names would be enough to get running on applying the methods and is certainly not too much to ask.

One other complaint I have with this book is that there is too much time spent on basic concepts while too little on the more complex concepts (as is often the case). The complex material is within reach if I reread it many times, however, more pages spent on these materials with corresponding less on the basics would have been preferable and resulted in a superior text.

For practitioners, I don't think this book will meet expectations. Practitioners open to other methods might instead check out The Elements of Statistical Learning.

That said, I am pleased with this book for its theory (it made me greatly appreciate jackknifing), and I would recommend this book to anyone interested in developing nonparametrics or who wants to understand some intricate nonparametric methods. It is well-written in what I anticipate was its aim: provide a strong theory base for modern nonparametric methods. For those with a milder interest, this book probably won't meet expectations.",11

Sergey Babkin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Boosting: Foundations and Algorithms (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series),everything about boosting,"It's a quite comprehensive book, describing lots of different ways to look at the AdaBoost family of algorithms. For all I can tell, the authors have collected all the state-of-the-art knowledge about boosting at the time the book was written, from the publications developed both by them and by the other people. So if you want to learn pretty much everything about boosting (up to the publication date), this is the book to read.

But be prepared that it's not a quick and casual introduction, it's a collection of the in-depth mathematical papers. It's a book that takes a very long time and much effort to read thoroughly and understand. You can skim over the proofs but it still takes a long time, after all it's pretty much everything known about boosting. I actually highly recommend not spending too much time on the proofs when you read it for the first time. This will give you a good overall picture, and then if you want to go deeper, read the book for the second time, the mathematics will make more sense on the second reading. You can also skip chapters depending on your interests, if you're not out to learn everything about boosting.

Probably the only really annoying thing from the engineering standpoint is that the algorithms in the book are what the mathematicians and the fans of functional programming call ""algorithms"", not the algorithms in the normal engineering sense. It takes some deciphering to turn them into a straightforward readable and understandable form. Bug again, it's a book about math, not engineering.

But, some of the symptoms can also appear when something else is going on, instead. On the other hand, not all of the symptoms necessarily appear when the condition in fact is active. The question then becomes, given a number of indicators that have some diagnostic value, and given that all of them are inaccurate some of the time, how do I combine the indicators' answers to get the best diagnosis of that condition?

This book proposes ""Boosting"" as the answer. Start with remarkably few technical requirements on the diagnostic indicators, plus some number of cases in which the condition's presence or absence is already known. Given that, Boosting iteratively determines the weight to assign each indicator. One requirement is that each indicator suggests presence or absence of the condition at least somewhat differently than random guessing - and being wrong most of the time is just as useful as being right more often than not, since the algorithm automatically assigns negative weights to such indicators.

After that, the authors present rigorous development in a number of directions. I emphasize ""rigor"" - this text offers detailed development, analysis, and formal proof of the algorithm and its properties, far beyond the needs of someone who just wants to implement the technique. Implementable detail is there, but you'll spend a fair bit of time teasing it out of the dense notation used here.

Then, once basics have been established, the discussion branches out. The authors offer game-theoretic analysis of the algorithm, along with comparisons to related optimization techniques. After tightening some of the technical requirements, they apply it to decision trees with binary outcomes, to N-ary classification problems for N>2, and to more complex kinds of tasks, always with the same mathematical rigor.

Frankly, it's a bit much for someone just looking to get the broad picture or someone looking to code something up fast and try it out. But, it's not meant for those readers. To get the most out of it, you should come prepared to take your time, work out the meaning of each equation, follow the development carefully, and maybe even do some of the exercises. If you've already plowed through some ""yellow books,"" you'll know what I mean, even though this doesn't come from the Springer yellow series. For the prepared and patient reader, this has my highest recommendation

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pattern Recognition, Fourth Edition",Excellent,"Many who work in artificial intelligence have commented that it is the ability of the human brain to engage in pattern recognition that gives it true intelligence. Without a quantitative measure of machine intelligence it is difficult to assess this claim, but there is no doubt that being able to implement pattern recognition and classification in a machine in a manner that enables it to distinguish objects, find profitable patterns in financial time series, teach itself how to play a game by examining the moves, identify subsequences in genome data, identify malicious behavior in networks, and detect fraudulent behavior in mortgage contracts would be a major advance in artificial intelligence and also a profitable one from a financial standpoint. Even if the machine required assistance from a human to do these tasks it would still be very useful. If it were able to do them on its own without any supervision one could justifiably describe it as being more intelligent than one that required such supervision (the counterexample to this imputation of intelligence is simple trial-and-error, which of course is unsupervised).

This book is a formal treatment of pattern recognition that is geared to a readership with a strong mathematical background and which makes as its major theme the difference between `supervised' and `unsupervised' pattern recognition, with this difference sometimes being more qualitative than what one would like. In the introduction to the book the authors make clear the distinction between these approaches, motivate the problem of the classification of features, and outline briefly the stages in the design of a pattern classification system. As is well known, supervised pattern recognition involves the use of training data, whereas unsupervised pattern recognition does not. In the latter case, it is left to the machine to find similarities in the feature vectors, and then cluster the similar feature vectors together. Researchers in the field of pattern recognition have devised an enormous number of algorithms and reasoning patterns to perform both unsupervised and supervised learning, and they have not necessarily developed these approaches in the context of machine intelligence. Thus the book could also be viewed as a mathematical theory of pattern recognition instead of one that is embedded in the field of artificial intelligence. However it is classified it is a useful and important work, and is well worth the time taken to read and study.

One of the most interesting (and esoteric) discussions is found in chapter 15 of the book. One of these concerns algorithms for `competitive learning' wherein representatives are designated and then ""compete"" with each other after a feature vector X is presented to the algorithm. The ""winner"" is the representative that is closer to X and the representatives are then updated by moving the winner toward X, with the rest remaining constant or move toward X at a slower rate. The competitive learning algorithm is parametrized by the learning rates of the winner and the losers, and the losers can have different learning rates. The investigator however selects the values of these parameters beforehand, and therefore competitive learning strictly speaking should not be classified as totally unsupervised. To be really unsupervised the competitive learning algorithm would have to make the selection of these parameters and tune them as needed to reach the convergence criterion. The authors do discuss briefly a version of the algorithm where the learning rate is variable, but the rate is still subject to certain constraints. Chapter 15 also contains a brief discussion of the use of genetic algorithms in clustering.

Another topic in the book that is both interesting and important and is still surprisingly unknown by many is that of `independent component analysis'. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a generalization of principal component analysis in that it tries to find a transformation that takes a feature vector into one whose components are mutually independent, instead of merely decorrelated. All of the random variables must be non-Gaussian in order for this technique to work, since the Gaussian case gives back the usual principal component analysis. Independent component analysis is beginning to be applied to many different areas, including finance, risk management, medical imaging, and physics. It remains to see whether it will become a standardized tool in the many mathematical and statistical software packages that exist at the present time. The authors discuss two different ways to perform independent component analysis, one being an approach based on higher order cumulants, and the other, interestingly, on mutual information. In the latter approach, the mutual information between the transformed components is calculated to be the Kullback-Leibler probability distance between the joint probability distribution of the transformed components and the product of the marginal probability densities. This distance is of course zero if the components are statistically independent. The strategy is then to find the transformational matrix that minimizes the mutual information, since this will make the components maximally independent. As the authors point out, the problem with this approach is that the elements of the transformation matrix are hidden in the marginal probability distribution functions of the transformed variables. They then outline an approach that allows them to calculate the mutual information with the assumption that the transformation matrix is unitary.",5

Nino,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Character of Physical Law (MIT Press),Refreshing Look at how Physics Works,"As a practicing physicist, having read and enjoyed Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and Weinberg's ""Lake Views"", this Richard Feynman lecture series on the ""Character of Physical Law"" is even more enjoyable. It reaffirms simple truths in science research that are often forgotten in an age of automated analysis, that for example one must dig into the details of an experiment or observation with as little bias as possible to uncover the next aha moment and what is worth pursuing next (in my experience, one always finds something worthwhile if one digs, even if it is just explaining what went wrong) that arriving at the same answer by using different sets of equations (working in energy vs force space is a favorite example of mine) is anything but a waste of time, as different calculational paths lead on to connections to different phenomena. Despite being almost 50 years old, this series of lectures remains fresh (contrasting with books on Information Technology where one can get bored reading about predictions in technology advancement that have come true already 10 years later (for example, Bill Gates' late 1990's ""Business at the Speed of Thought"").",5

But at certain points in this book, Feynman begins to venture off and begin discussing things that are relatively complex and I can't say are really intended for people that don't have a solid background in physics.
I personally found myself either thinking his lecture was either too simple (or explained extremely well) or too complex. All in all, I'm not sure who Feynman had in mind for an audience when he gave his lecture, but I would imagine it's for the person that has a solid background in physics and wishes to indulge in some physics ""brain-candy"" to think about some extremely interesting concepts.

Paul A. Jackson,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Character of Physical Law (MIT Press),Feynman Delivers,"This is yet another book that attempts to convey the essence of physics to common people. After explaining exactly why it can't be done, arguing that you'll never get it, Feynman goes right ahead and does it anyway.
For each topic, you get a feel for his goal in covering a topic. He explains gravity, yes, to explain gravity, but also because by explaining it he can also convey what essential properties gravity has that other laws have.
He also explains the difference between fundamental laws and the consequences of those laws. That the individual laws are reversible, but that probability is responsible for the arrow of time. He spends a lot of time showing the difficult relationship between the basic laws (which are reversible) and the irreversibility of events. Both are characteristics of the physical universe but the latter is not a fundamental law. The latter is a logical outcome of them.
So there's a hierarchy, which goes; fundamental laws like gravity at the ground level, consequences of them like irreversibility and surface tension at one level up, organic chemistry further up, then eventually concepts like tree, frog, man, pain, beauty, good and evil - each at a higher level, but based upon the levels below them, and difficult to fully predict using only the laws of the lower levels. The levels can be extended up and down. Below gravity is the unification theory of everything. Above good and evil are love, politics, etc.
And then he asks, of the extremes on this hierarchy, the fundamental laws and the most abstract concepts, which is closest to God? After asking for patience with his religious reference, he spends little time before revealing his belief that the question is flawed. To understand God is to understand how the levels interrelate; how the fundamental laws were ""chosen"" so that they would lead to the unfolding of all the beautiful complexity that we see around us.
Is this what you want to learn? Why else do we read these books than to attempt to gain a bit more insight into the eternal questions. Most authors that tackle the nature of the universe have a theological axe to grind (the need for God or not) and can't hide it. This book did more on this topic, with fewer pages, while offending me the least because of any theological bias (either way), than anything I've read before.",77

However some parts of it I had to read two and three times and I am still not sure that I understood everything. But that depends on my shortcoming and has nothing to do with the style of Kevin Warwick. In my opinion this is a first class intro to AI and I would recommend it to young people who have to decide what to study at college. It might be that AI is the new shooting star after neuroscience. Still it seems to me that from a gender point of view AI would need some female input. Of all the literature recommended as a further read in Kevin Warwicks book there is no (!) book or article written by a female author. This seems the only shortcoming of this new scence. Is it the computing or the scientific approach that keeps women away from AI? I think like every other science AI would need the female input. Besides this general observationlet me give one more recommendation. An interesting article in Nature: ""On creative machines and the physical origins of freedom"" by Hans J. Briegel, doi: 10.1038/srep0052. I mention this because it seems to me that this is the direction which scientific research in AI should proceed: ethics and freedom of mind paired with responsibility, because as Kevin Warwick points out, robots have no conscience and that they never will stand up against humans is a myth which goes back to science fiction writer Isac Asimov (p.75). Apart of all this I want to stress that one of the highlights in Warwicks book are the building blocks: they reach from a definition of intelligence over classical AI to the philosophy of AI to biological AI and robotics.

How does IBM's Watson work? How does Siri work? Where is AI headed and what kind of work is currently being done? You might find partial answers to those questions here, if you can manage to grind your way through all the equations, tables, logic puzzles, and a lot of mumbo jumbo.

The best part of the book was in the discussions of chatbots and our efforts at designing programs that might pass the Turing Test.

Michael Stahl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Computer and Machine Vision, Fourth Edition: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities","Important summary of the field, but not recommended as first reading","A very large book with a lot of information, starting from the very basics of computer vision, and up to very complicated challenges.

The book's scope is huge, as it tried to summarize the whole field (the book is ~800 pages long). There are a lot of references to academic research for those interested in getting the whole details of math and research that this book is based on.

The book goes from basic, low-level vision operations (filters; thresholding; edge, corner detection; morphology (erode and dilate)) to more complicated combinations:

- Intermediate level vision: line, circle, ellipse detection, Hough transform, pattern matching)
- 3D visions and motion (Invariants; perspective; camera calibration; motion; Kalman filter)
- Real-time pattern recognition systems (reviewing a number of real-world applications)

The book moves from readable to complicated, back and forth. There are a lot of mathematics (which I mostly skipped). The main problem with the math is that it is given in a very concise summary. More like a reminder for the already-initiated. So as an introductory book this math is lost on you as not all the pieces are there. It also makes for hard reading of these parts.

I read this as my first book on Computer Vision. I learned a LOT from it, but I don't think it's a good recommendation as a first book. Too hard. Also, in most cases the math is not needed for what I do.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Computer and Machine Vision, Fourth Edition: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities",Great for DIA beginners. It just makes sense!,"I am new to Digital Image Analysis, and am coming into this from a biology background. I've spent lots of money on DIA books, and this book is the first I've found that talks straight, and clear. It just makes sense. Although I am a newbie, I will venture to say the book is comprehensive in its coverage, so worth a look by anyone at any level. I can't say how much it would benefit an experienced person, but if you teach a course in this subject... TAKE NOTICE of this approach! The author is refreshingly concise and gets to the point and easily keeps my interest, which I really appreciate. It's actually a fun read! I am basically on a crash course in DIA. He follows with a commentary that really brings everything together, and into context, much like may occur in a lecture hall or discussion for a college course on the topic. He follows that with a thorough job of the most recent developments to date (as I write this, it is September 2012, and the book was published this year). He includes references to the most important papers historically in his comments, and the most important advances in the current literature in the final section on each topic. it's like having a complete, and very well organized literature review at your fingertips, as well as being a primer. I like that he keeps this lit review OUT of the straight forward explanations, so many books try to do it all in one place and it is just too much to cover and be clear. But it is extremely important, and by the time I get there, I know enough to appreciate it much, much more. There are also problem sets, and example photos in the book to illustrate the text. I am a person who discovered that I often benefit from going WAY back to old textbooks to get the basic information and understanding I need, because the newer authors can't fit that into their books anymore, and it's old hat to them anyway so they forget that not everyone knows it. Newbies really need the background! This is one science author who understands that, and the organization of the book is very effective. This book makes sense. THANK YOU DR. DAVIES!",6

Charles,2.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mining and Analysis: Fundamental Concepts and Algorithms,One of the WORST Data Mining Book I've ever read,"I can't believe previous readers rate this book so high. This is one of the WORST Data Mining Book I've ever read.

The book is poorly written in both logic and language. One critical function of a book, especially a text book, is to help readers to learn the knowledge. But this book only inhibits that work because one might use more than 3 times of time to learn the same knowledge from this book compared with other great data mining books. The writing skills of the author is so limited that most concept and algorithm is instructed very unsatisfactorily which leads the reader to feel confused about most things. Thus they can not learn data mining and analysis technique efficiently and clearly. So if you are interested in Data Mining but do not have a strong knowledge, stay away from this book! It will drain your interest because you're gonna feel learning through this book is soooooo exhausting.

The authors tried to make the book more ""mathematical"" so they added a bunch of unnecessary mathematical symbol into unnecessary equations without sufficient explanation and illustration. Further more, there is a lot of key points of data mining method missed. For example, this book does not fully explained the pros and cons of cluster methods so the reader will never know which method to use in a certain situation. As for classification part, ensemble method is omitted which is popularly used currently. There is even errors in pseudo-code. The content schedule seems draw much attention on kernel method, but I don't think anyone may be benefit from it. Chapter 5(Kernel Method) itself is just a jungle. Anyway, it listed so much disjoint concept by perplexing equation, symbol and statement, but few of them hit the point.

The slogan of this book is it covers some cutting-edge area but still good for a starter. But I can not see any cutting edge knowledge in this book. So if you are familiar with data mining and analysis, you will never need this book. And, if you are a starter, you will never get your first step by reading this book.",6
Herbert Gintis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness,"Full of insights, but exscessively longwinded","I rate this book highly for its many interesting insights---great food for thought. I think Penrose' assessments of models of consciousness by other physicists are on the mark, including his critique of decoherence theories. He is probably on the right track in treating the collapse of the wave function as a real phenomenon, in which case he is correct is saying ""what is going on will have no chance of being properly understood until we have a much more profound appreciation of the very nature of matter, time, space, and the laws that govern them."" (p. 395)

I was not persuaded by Penrose' own theory at all. The only connection between quantum mechanics and consciousness is that they are both mysterious. Moreover, it is the qualia of consciousness that is mysterious, not the fact that we are non-algorithmic.",2
Alan Rivière,4.0 out of 5 stars,Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness,A difficult but fascinating read,"Shadows of The Mind by Sir Roger Penrose is a difficult read. It is not for everybody. It requires a strong background in mathematics and the physical sciences. The reward is a fascinating peek at the science of human consciousness.

This book is a follow-up of Sir Penrose's first book The Emperor's New Mind. It is divided into two parts. In Part I, using Gödel's incompleteness theorems as he did in his first book, Sir Penrose argues that the human mind, unlike an electronic computer, is non-algorithmic and hence non-computational. In plain English, artificial intelligence based on electronic computers is impossible, no matter how advanced computers become. His argument is terribly dry and mathematical. The point I took from Sir Penrose's argument here is that the human mind works in a way distinctly different from that of an electronic computer. His non-computational thesis is contrary to mainstream theories that the mind emerges from the brain as a result of complex computations at the synapses of the neurons.

The book becomes interesting in Part II, where Sir Penrose explains the ""puzzle mysteries"" and ""paradox mysteries"" as well as various aspects of quantum mechanics. But the most fascinating is his theory of how consciousness arises at the human brain, which he co-developed with Dr. Stuart Hameroff, an anesthesiologist and a professor at the University of Arizona. The theory is later called Orchestrated Objective Reduction or Orch-OR. Basically Orch-OR proposes that consciousness is the result of the self-collapse of a quantum wavefunction induced by quantum gravity at the microtubules of the neurons. The theory of Orch-OR complies with Sir Penrose's non-computational aspect of the human mind. He further proposes that the self-collapse of the wavefunction to a definite state (or objective reduction) is not random but rather influenced by ""Platonic values"" embedded in the fundamental fabric of space-time geometry at the Planck scale, and hence the objective reduction is ""orchestrated"". These Platonic values include mathematical truth, aesthetic and ethical values. Orch-OR is controversial but it represents a fascinating new approach in the science of human consciousness (See my comment below).

Sir Roger Penrose is a brilliant mathematical physicist, but he is a terrible science writer. He doesn't know how to simplify a complex concept to the degree that a layman can grasp, like Stephen Hawking does. Mathematics becomes a shackle in the book that holds back the reader. Five star for Penrose the scientist, two for Penrose the science writer.",1
George Wittenberg,4.0 out of 5 stars,Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness,Lifeless Logic,"Convincing argument that the mind is not a Turing Machine and that's about it. All living things, especially plants, and the cells they are made of have evolved highly complex minds to sustain and improve their being. It seems obvious that this is not unique to a species, but is a universal characteristic of everything we can observe extended to the Cosmos -- the universal mind and consciousness. To understand consciousness we have to understand how living things embody the universal mind. So in this regard this book, while an ingenious mathematical argument, is more classical newtonian thinking than a modern scientific exploration of the mind. Such a treatment can be found in, ""The Holographic Universe"" by Michael Talbot.",1
John Gale,4.0 out of 5 stars,Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness,Mind's Shadows illuminated,"Another stunning book by Sir Roger Penrose. It's really a five star book discounted here by one star because those lacking physics and mathematics will find some passages hard work, even though the author is being as kind as possible in a book of this calibre.
The book is a neat sequel to his ""The Emperor's New Mind"", extending the central theme that our little-understood human consciousness allows us to think way beyond the computational and mindless world of artificial intelligence.
In doing so, we have a marvellous survey of classical and modern physics, including the mysteries of the quantum world.
Sir Roger raises the question 'Will we ever be able to truly understand our own Nature-provided brain and its processes in terms of our own science?', and argues that, somewhere out there beyond our present reach, there is a unifying Platonic view of the Universe.

Michael Andrews,3.0 out of 5 stars,Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness,Penrose's Ambush,"This is a dense book and Penrose is nothing but fair on the surface. It is only in reading to the end that one realizes the Platonic ambush lurking there. Looking back it seems that Penrose's fairness was misguided and really was a bit of sly editing and disingenuous dodging of issues that were designed to skew the facts. The OR (read Platonic realism or forms) was only a trick that was supposed to replace the collapse of the wave function but was really a Platonic ambush to garner support for Platonic Dualism. The book looses all credibility in the last ten pages in spite of the fact that all the preceding pages seemed ultra-credible. Perhaps if Penrose was as smart as Godel he would have hidden his Platonism for another book instead of ruining his fine efforts here.
Consciousness, the putative concern of the book, is never defined and in lieu of even the suggestion of an answer all the reader gets is a Platonic sales pitch.
Although I do own the ""Road to Reality"" I will not read it without first reading the ending to be sure I am not wasting my time on yet another ambush.",3
N/A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness,A work with far reaching implications,"Between the beautifully written prologue and epilogue, this book approaches a range of topics in modern physics in a unique and readable way. Through a continuation of some earlier work, Penrose furthers an argument for brain function and conciousness that many in the artificial intelligence field will not appreciate. He presents his case that the human mind will never be simulated with digital a computer, no matter how complex. But that is not his main focus of this book.
Even more facinating are his calculations which indicate how mathematically unique our existence is under the 2nd law of thermodynamics. To me, it's ultimately ironic that the physical principal which orders our universe and makes intelligent life possible (the 2nd law), is the result of an unimaginably improbable set of initial conditions. Although Penrose never invokes the concept of a creator or supreme being, in my mind, this poses an interesting challenge to those in the scientific community who claim our universe is simply the result of random particle collisions over a long period of time.
If we combine the concepts of similar structures scaling across space and time (tensegrity and fractals), with Penrose's ideas that consciousness may be associated with quantum gravity interactions in microtubules (present in all living cells), perhaps there is far more mystery and beauty to this existence than some would now believe...

Raphael D.

I've played around with ggplot2, and went to Edward Tufte's seminars, and eventually found my way to this book.

As the other reviewers mention, this is NOT a how-to book. It's a much deeper, fundamnetal treatment of how data and graphics connect, and how we represent them. So, it's not as much a ""useful"" book, except insofar as it changes the way you put together your next graph.

This book crystalized a lot of concepts I already understood, though only vaguely and intuitively. Like, a legend and an an axis are really the same thing, and that a stacked bar and a pie chart are identical except for the coordinate system used.

It's quite a dense slog to read this book, so I recommend you pick it up and read a few pages here and there, and follow through on the issues that catch your interest.

Mark A. Weiss,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Grammar of Graphics (Statistics and Computing),"skip details (esp. formalisms); instead get hilighter ready for principles, perspectives","Most of what other reviewers say has factual accuracy. But first I must say that the ""subset"" of people who enjoy CLEVELAND (WILLIAM S.)'s works will enjoy the Grammar of Graphics book.

Sorry, but people who enjoy TUFTE are not potential candidates for this book because Tufte has way too little to say about graphics (despite his books, lectures, which ultimately are about $$$ for Tufte). Tufte's main thing is his admonition ""don't do chart junk"" followed by his second favorite thing: join with him and disparage the ""cognitive style"" of PowerPoint. The former is true, but is not terribly subtle. As for the second, the tool of PowerPoint need not be used in the boring ""cognitive style"" with bullets and ""branding"". I for one have made plenty of PowerPoint presentations totally unlike these.

The summary of ""subset""s of folks: William S. Cleveland followers: yes, you'll love this book; those who mistake Tufte for the ultimate graphical guru probably will find this book ""too much"". Note that the author of the Grammar of Graphics book literally says how Cleveland wins the citations contest in his book. No surprise, because Cleveland has made many creative developments for statistical graphics and has also studied graphical perception. (As just ONE of a myriad of examples: residuals are very badly ""mis-read"" by our perception when there is a steeply sloped curve; residual in y- direction may be very large, but we see only a very much shorter perpendicular distance.)

(Finally, in fairness, Tufte has had two good ideas -- but only two compared to Cleveland's several dozen. Tufte's tics-at-data (for x- and y- separate marginal distributions [essentially 1-D scatterplots made by tics]) and Tufte's white-grid-run-thru-of-bar-plots are his two contributions of any substance.)

OK. Thanks for bearing with my review which, thus far, has covered the Cleveland and Tufte subsets of readers. Time for the Grammar of Graphics book character itself --without context of being a Cleveland reader or a Tufte Reader.

If you have not experienced reading Cleveland's books (Elements of Graphing Data and/or Visualizing Data), I admit that this book will be more difficult for you.

The above point aside, you should know, like other reviewers said, that this book is not a how-to. Nor is it like Cleveland's books -- chock full of guideline principles. There are plenty of principles in the book, but with its size, the CONCENTRATION of principles to pages of text is low.

THE BEST PERSPECTIVE ON THIS BOOK: The best perspective is to not sweat consuming every little detail. Especially skip all the formalisms (even though this is ostensibly the topic of the book!) Instead, just enjoy. This is one book definitely to apply your highlighter to. Forget the formalisms completely. Concentrate on the important points made throughout -- but you'll need to highlight them. If you come to the book from Cleveland (William S.) it will be easier for you to spot the important points. Just don't think you have to learn details and formalisms.

One tip -- Cleveland reader or not -- whenever there is any text suggesting a perspective, that text may well be calling for your highlighter -- not always, but often.

Go for principles, perspectives and ignore formalisms. You'll be more at ease and enjoy the book.

If you think you might do both William S. Cleveland's books AND the Grammar of Graphics book -- no question, do Cleveland first (Elements of Graphing Data [more basic] and Visualizing Data [more advanced statistical questions addressed graphically]).

- Release early. Release often.
- Given a large enough beta-tester base every problem will be obvious to someone.
- Smart data structure and dumb code works best.
- If you trust your beta testers they will become valuable.
- Recognizing good user ideas can be better than having your own.

Yes, it's dated. Yes, all the references are 20 years old. That doesn't make any of the main points of the book any less valid. The software world has changed. This book is the original book that explains why. And it's still the gold standard on the Open Source movement.",1
J. head,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Cathedral & the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary,Is it time for Linux ?,"This books starts off with a very good history of the development of the Linux operating software. This open source development process started the author thinking about the two software development methods, the Cathedral method, where a large corporate structure hires programmers to develop software, keeps the source code secret, and charges large amounts to recoup it costs, not from the original product development, but from the expected legacy problems, technical support, bug fixing, software updates, etc. On the other hand the bazaar method, encourages open source software. Open source software encourages a programmer or group within the hacker community to gain ascendancy, to possess and maintain and steer the software to keep it relevant. The Author's point is that with most business models in the future the Cathedral method (read Microsoft) will not be able to compete with the Bazaar method (read Linux). In the Cathedral method the programmers must be hired, the bazaar method the hackers are attracted to a problem, become more dedicated, revisions and bugs are handled at internet speed. The author tells of many real-life business experiences companies have had adopting the open source method. The middle of the book explains the hacker ethic and how the hacker community operates. The reader learns the true meaning of ""hacker"" v.s. ""cracker"" and the true meaning of free software. The author predicts that open source software will make deep in-roads into the Fortune-500 companies. That their investments in hardware and records may be dependent on one software company's decision to continue supporting that software revision is the problem. Open source software would provide a proliferation of hacker communities willing to constantly update older software. The author appears to know his stuff and progressively throughout the book the author lets it leak out that he is one of the hacker community and is a player/spokesman in this software battle I found this book a real eye-opener, can Microsoft's workforce continue to support software like Windows 2000 with 60 million lines of code, as opposed to Linux taking advantage of a worldwide army of hackers reporting bugs, writing patches, and keeping hardware drivers updated. Time will tell.

This book was enough to prompt this reader to obtain a copy of Linux just in case..",1
Jonathan Pepin,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Cathedral & the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary,good history book,"Ahah seriously, I enjoyed reading it. It was really nice to read about how the tech world today is like it is, and where it comes from, and read about the creation of linux, and mozilla, etc.
It also explains perfectly the difference between opensource and proprietary software. First why open source simply exists, what's it forces and advantages, and then explains how it can make money and be that attractive. And how some open source project can become better than softwares made by multi-billion companies.
A good read to get to know better the industry :)",1
V. Vasiliadis,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Cathedral & the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary,For those who question why open source makes sense,"Eric Raymond presents a coherent and well-supported case that explains why open source makes commercial sense. Putting aside the ""religious"" fervor of some of his arguments, the logic on why the open source movement can spawn successful businesses is irrefutable. Read it and you will understand why traditional (proprietary) software business models have become a dying breed. I would rate the book a ""5"" but for some parts where the text becomes somewhat convoluted and repetitive. Overall, a must-read for anyone involved in software development.",1
Benjamin Rossen,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Cathedral & the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary,"A classic with much to offer, but flawed.","Eric Raymond is widely regarded as the anthropologist of the hacker community. This is Eric Raymond's revised classic with some new material. It is the first comprehensive commentary on the sociology of the Open Source community, and recommended reading for anyone doing business in software development, or running a business that depends on software and the Internet.

Like many of Eric Raymond's colleagues and fellow Geeks, he is clearly a brilliant individual, carried forward by focused effort and imagination. And like many talented people, he is an autodidact; self taught bar some courses in philosophy and mathematics. This is not a criticism. Raymond's career, publications and contribution show amply the intellectual qualities he possesses. However, his lack of training in social, economic and cultural science shows. And, as an insider (he is one of the original tribe of hackers) he is not the best person to make a disinterested commentary on the hacker community.

Great hackers, he tells us, are humble people. A more critical observer would have analyzed the comparative payoffs of styles showing why a loud mouth style - while it might work for some performers or show oriented careers - doesn't pay in this community. This is generally true of communities in which peers are well able to judge the quality of each other's contributions. Faking it doesn't payoff, and looking like you might need to fake it is counter productive. Insofar as the behaviour of chief hackers is humble, we learn more about the social economy of hackerdom than about distinctive individual personalities.

Despite many insights, Eric Raymond is wrong in his principal analysis. Why, he asks, do talented people spend years of unpaid work on projects that benefit others for no pecuniary reward? He characterizes hackers as members of a gift giving community, and attributes too much of the hacker motivation to altruism and idealism.

The central problem is not ""why do hackers work for no pay?"" Rather, why do people work for money? Or, more fundamentally, why do people work? I take it that readers will agree that we can roughly divide our motives into physiological drives (hunger, thirst, need for shelter, sex) and the ""higher"" needs (self fulfilment and meaning). After satisfying the needs for food, shelter and companionship why do we continue to work at all? If it is to get status, to get power, to feel good about ourselves and similar, then money beyond basic needs is unnecessary. Onassis once remarked ""Without women, all the money in the world is worthless."" Some of us work to become wealthy, and we trade that wealth for status, power, respect and admiration, and perhaps we use our wealth to get women, sex and occasionally love. If this is what these motives are for, then even the higher needs are secondary to sex; or, as evolutionary psychologists tell us, are all about reproduction.

Money is a means. If I can earn status, power and respect directly, why waste time with money? Of course, money is fungible. That means it can be traded easily for a great many things; a big house and a luxury car, perhaps. But possessing these is merely another way of obtaining status, power, respect, admiration and sex, if not love.

Why am I writing this review? By my own dispassionate analysis, I am advertising my capacity to say sensible things and I am making a reputation; this is an asset in the social and commercial market place. Amazon might like me for doing this, but they would be mistaken to think that I write reviews out of altruism directed at Amazon; at least not defined in any metaphysical or moral sense. Sociobiologists denote some social instincts ""altruism"" but these are operational definitions of instincts as Machiavellian as any scheming tactician can be said to possess; in that sense I may be an altruist. Hackers too, for their work is not unlike my book reviews. Hackers trade in an economy that differs not one jot from the money economy, and Eric Raymond, in so far as he supposes it to be a fundamentally different kind of economy, is mistaken.

Likewise the account of hacker commitment to lofty ideals are not any more credible - but also not any less credible - than the mission statements and codes of ethics written by CEOs of major corporations. Among hackers are people as likely to steal code as are others to donate code; to write viruses as to write Fetch Mail. An anarchic disrespect for some of our more widely accepted conventions for protecting property rights is a characteristic of hacker mentality; not one that we should admire. Of course, honourable idealists are found among hackers; Eric Raymond is clearly one of them. Take, for example, the Open Source Initiative that is largely his work. What an outstanding contribution that is! Clearly he is passionate about his beliefs and ideals. But honourable idealists are found among entrepreneurs too, also successful ones, and even among politicians. Let us not delude ourselves about what it is the really motivates us and our fellow travellers.",7

Voracious Reader,3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning for Hackers: Case Studies and Algorithms to Get You Started,Machine Learning for Non-Hackers,"By page count, this is primarily a book on R, with some additional time spent on machine learning.

There is way too much time spent on R, dedicated to such things as parsing email messages, and spidering webpages, etc. These are things that no-one with other tools available would do in R. And it's not that it's easier to do it in R, it's actually harder than using an appropriate library, like JavaMail. And yet, while much time is spent in details, like regexes to extract dates (ick!), more interesting R functions are given short shrift.

There's some good material in here, but it's buried under the weight of doing everything in R. If you are a non-programmer, and want to use only one hammer for everything, then R is not a bad choice. But it's not a good choice for developers that are already comfortable with a wider variety of tools.

The book leverages the popularity of Watson to gain attention, and then diverges into the other ground-breaking efforts underway in the company's research labs and business development sectors. While interesting and thought-provoking, this is more of a broad overview of the emerging technologies rather than a technical reference. Each chapter includes hypothetical scenarios for where the technologies can be applied, which comes across at times as idealistic and an aggressive sales pitch for IBM services.

Advances in health care is perhaps the best example. Twenty years ago, aspiring resident doctors carried Blackberry type devices with them containing medical texts. Future doctors can carry with them a few million pages of medical journals and multiple medical text books and produce suggested diagnoses and treatments.The computer system can learn from its mistakes.

Yes, the authors are from IBM and therefore the book has a certain positive bias you would expect from the hawkers of Watson, but these two writers in particular are thought leaders -- and, besides, literature for non-technical readers on the Watson breakthrough is few and far between, so take what you can get! I mean it - read this. Two other such sources are ""Final Jeopardy"" by Stephen Baker and the chapter I devoted to the matter in my book (see below). I would note one issue with nomenclature: ""Watson"" was a very specialized system to compete on the TV Quiz show ""Jeopardy!"", and IBM's use of the same term/name to refer to a broader set of research areas is a bit more of a publicity tactic than a savvy use of buzzwords. However, there are meaningful relationships between the Jeopardy! demonstration (by far the most impressive demonstration of computer question-answering, ever!) and the technical approach IBM is driving for other application areas such as in healthcare.

JohnDiego,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Common Lisp,"Awesome, detailed, and elightening introduction to Common Lisp","There are many glowing reviews for the hardback edition, and my paperback copy is identical to it. Refer there for more reviews. Practical Common Lisp

This is a great introduction to Common Lisp. Thankfully it doesn't get to the stuff I learned in my Lisp manual 40 years ago, CAR, CDR and similarly arcane functions until 1/4 of the way in to the book. Much of the insight in to the unique power of Lisp was lost in the orignal books while mucking around in list structures.

The light bulb starts to click on what a powerful language Common Lisp is in Chapter 5 about functions, and clicks on brighter in Chapter 7 on macros (despite my deep-seated reservations about macros as a long-time professional c/c++ programmer), and many chapters after that illuminate the power, flexibility, expressiveness and conciseness.

I have one small complaint. In my paper copy (yes I am a bit old skul and do better reading from ink on dead trees, but at least in my case the book will do an outstanding job of carbon sequestration since I don't burn books, nor do most others), the print is slighly faint and fuzzy, and varies some from page to page. I was reading without my glasses one night and saw the reason. The font is slightly fuzzy with dots on narrow parts of letters and alternating dark/light areas on thicker parts. This likely saves a fair amount of ink in printing, but it detracts from the appearance and readability of a very fine book.

One surprising thing missing from the book is any discussion of the art of debugging lisp. There is a discussion of handling error conditions and exceptions, but that is not debugging. There are some good links online (search Google for Common Lisp debugging), but given how different debugging Lisp is compared to other languages, where most readers will come from, a chapter on that would have put the final icing on an outstanding book.",2

And last but not least, the book itself is well made and seems to be able to last for decades.",1
blueduck,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Common Lisp,Great Book,"First, these are my credentials as a reviewer. I have read this entire book (some parts more than once). I have completed modestly large freelance projects using php, actionscript, python and c. I do not have a formal background in computer science (I have a degree in Art). I learn by practice and by reading books.

Thinking of this book, here's what comes to mind, -one of the most enjoyable learning experiences I have had. It communicates itself with effectiveness, originality and a careful attention to detail.

When I first began using this book, I was skeptical of it. Chapter 3 introduces Common Lisp with a 'Practical', a step-by-step build-up of a small Lisp program. The next few chapters explain syntax, functions, variables and macros.

I was skeptical because, at the time, I understood little of Chapter 3 and it seemed to me that the following chapters (syntax, functions, variables, etc.) should have preceded Chapter 3. There are no end-of-chapter directives and only the 'Practical' chapters include significant tasks for cementing concepts. What does it mean?

It becomes evident that this organization is a good thing. It forces the reader to engage the book with a fresh approach. After reading a few chapters following Chapter 3, a necessary re-read of Chapter 3 yields great understanding. It sets the reader into a rhythm of reading... reading some parts once for creative enjoyment and once again for critical comprehension.

This is an important aspect of this book and my appreciation of it. The author does not try to anticipate and satisfy the expectations of the reader (a linear presentation of mixed code/explanation). Instead, like an artist, the author presents his method and changes the reader's perspectives to match his own.

The organization also adds something to the long-term usability of the book. Mini-programs and behavior test-cases are mostly reserved for the 'Practical' chapters. The other chapters are not cluttered with these things and are devoted to single topics. 'For example there is a chapter devoted to numbers. Another chapter is about the 'format' function, Common Lisp's equivalent of printf. The material in these chapters is patiently and thoroughly presented.

This is one of my favorite books. After reading it I was able to write a Common Lisp program that uses classes, packages and macros.",1
Philip H. Smyth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Common Lisp,"""Practical"" is the key.","There have been any number of excellent books written on Lisp and its sister, Scheme. ""The Little Lisper"" and ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"" are two that come to mind. What most of them have in common is an emphasis on applying the powerful semantic features of Lisp to fundamental questions in computer science.

This book does show that side of Lisp. However, its most important feature is in showing an underexposed side of common Lisp - that of a potent and underutilized tool for real world programming applications.

File operations, XML and HTML output and web services are all covered. Constructs like the loop macro and package system are given extensive treatment. These were essential tools in the days when Lisp Machines roamed the earth. The unique power of the ""defmacro"" user defined macro facility is shown to good advantage.

I am giving the author five stars for a comprehensive *practical* treatment. This book demonstrates that Lisp is as capable as the current breed of ""dynamic"" languages for application programming - while possessing unique functional powers that have yet to be equaled.",12
J. Sacher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Common Lisp,"Incredible book for an experiences programmer, but LISP newbie","I graduate college with an Electrical Engineering Degree, but took many Computer Science classes. I went into software, instead of hardware, as a career choice. I have used Perl, Java, C, VB 3-6, C# and other languages in my day to day job over 8 years. My only experience with LISP is hearing about it, while in college, and possibly the use of EMACS when doing Unix systems programming in C. While trying to locate good beginning courses for a co-worker, I came across MIT's online 6.001 class, using LISP. This rekindled my interest in learning LISP. The book for this course really didn't answer the ""why should I learn LISP?"" question. This book does.

After intending to purchase the textbook for that course here at Amazon and actually ordering it, I found this book. I wound up ordering this book and canceling the other (since it was online). If you are very low on funds, you can also find the text of this book online. I prefer a hard copy of the book for easier reference.

This is a great introduction to a deep topic, starting with the first few chapters.

Once you've absorbed this book, I will admit it's a bit hard to go back to for reference. Seibel's style is insidious, he lets Lisp seep into you. You cannot point to a line and say, ha! that's where I learned macros, because macros are now a part of you. I think it's an excellent (nonpareil, even) pedagogical style. YMMV, but I'm all for Sidious Seibel's approach.

This book had a 2-star review. I created a 1-star review to address the specific criticisms made by that person. The old text pertaining to that is below.

... with a 1-star review! What better way?

I cannot imagine how the reviewer came up with 2 stars. Maybe: ""This book is #1 (hence *cough* 1-star)"" ?

Shoddy writing? Please! This book made me giggle in glee in parts...

Lisp in a Box seems to be the reviewer's only objection. It's easy to find and install, a more worthwhile endeavor than getting mad and swearing to find every single last reference to LispBox in subsequent chapters.

The 'Learn CL in 21 days' reference the reviewer makes is telling, they clearly expect a brief howto-learn-this-language-in-7 hours, judging by their admission that learning how the if statement works is the crux of learning a language.

Certainly this book is better read and digested before opening a lisp environment. And that is definitely the way to learn a new deep topic imho. Understand something in depth, then write small programs to test your understanding of it. Frittering away your time between writing one-liners and reading a book is just that, you won't gain any understanding. It may work for Perl, but ;-)

Lisp is a language to blow your mind. Expecting a quick howto is naive at best, and a sad troll attempt at worst. Read the music database chapter slowly and carefully. If you're attentive, you /will/ be hit with a wonderful epiphany of how Lisp is 'powerful'. Really. Really, really. Let the Loregasm begin!",7

Literally, it looks like a poorly scanned copy that someone printed on a cheap home laser printer, and the quality is the same as if one had done this. Many of the figures are useless because of this

What is more, there is very little margin on the right half of even pages. This means that you cannot normally read most of the right side of the paragraph, as the text goes almost into the spine of the book. You have to constantly tilt the book, move your head closer, and struggle to read this text. You may say to yourself, ""No problem. I will just crack open the book wider."" Well, that is exactly what will happen: your book will crack! The glue in the binding is so cheap that pages started falling out of my book after light use. Trying to open it even the slightest will eventually rip the book apart. And you need to open it very widely because of the thickness of the cheap paper. The hardcover is only about one third of the thickness of this version.

Amazon lists this as the paperback version of the Machine Learning text by Mitchell.

However, the differences between the hardcover and the paperback are huge. The paperback was published in 1983. The Mitchell hardcover book was published fourteen years later in 1997. The authors on the paperback are labeled as ""Edited by Ryszard S. Michalski, Jaime G. Carbonell, and Tom M. Mitchell,"" while the hardcover lists the author as Tom Mitchell.

Critically, there are also significant differences in the contents. For example, chapter 8 in the hardcover version is titled Instance-based Learning. Chapter 8 in the paperback is titled Using Proofs and Refutations to Learn from Experience. Chapter 3 of the hardcover is called Decision Tree Learning. In the paperback, chapter 3 is called A Comparative Review of Selected Methods for Learning from Examples. This is not an issue of reordering; the paperback has totally different chapters. Use the Look Inside tool to see for yourself.

I suspect from the Symbolic Computation logo on the top of the cover, as well as from the lack of a true ""author,"" that the paperback edition is a collection of papers from the Symbolic Computation journal, and not a true textbook.

Concerned small-D democrat,5.0 out of 5 stars,The End of Error: Unum Computing (Chapman & Hall/CRC Computational Science),This book is revolutionary,"This book is revolutionary. That is the only way to describe it. I have been a professional computer science researcher for almost 40 years, and only once or twice before have I seen a book that is destined to make such a profound change in the way we think about computation. It is hard to imagine that after 70 years or so of computer arithmetic that there is anything new to say about it, but this book reinvents the subject from the ground up, from the very notion of finite precision numbers to their bit-level representation, through the basic arithmetic operations, the calculation of elementary functions, all the way to the fundamental methods of numerical analysis, including completely new approaches to expression calculation, root finding, and the solution of differential equations. On every page from the beginning to the end of the book there are surprises that just astonished me, making me re-think material that I thought had been settled for decades.

The methods described in this book are profoundly different from all previous treatments of numerical methods. Unum arithmetic is an extension of floating point arithmetic, but mathematically much cleaner. It never does rounding, so there is no rounding error. It handles what in floating point arithmetic is called ""overflow"" and ""underflow"" in a far more natural and correct way that makes them normal rather than exceptional. It also handles exceptional values (NaN, +infinity, -infinity) cleanly and consistently. Those contributions alone would have been a profound contribution. But the book does much more.

One of the reasons I think the book is revolutionary is that unum-based numerical methods can effortlessly provide provable bounds on the error in numerical computation, something that is very rare for methods based on floating point calculations. And the bounds are generally as tight as possible (or as tight as you want them), rather than the useless or trivial bounds as often happens with floating point methods or even interval arithmetic methods.

Another reason I consider the book revolutionary is that many of the unum-based methods are cleanly parallelizable, even for problems that are normally considered to be unavoidably sequential. This was completely unexpected.

A third reason is that in most cases unum arithmetic uses fewer bits, and thus less power, storage, and bandwidth (the most precious resources in today’s computers) than the comparable floating point calculation. It hard to believe that we get this advantage in addition to all of the others, but it is amply demonstrated in the book. Doing efficient unum arithmetic takes more logic (e.g. transistors) than comparable floating point arithmetic does, but as the author points out, transistors are so cheap today that that hardly matters, especially when compared to the other benefits.

Some of the broader themes of the book are counterintuitive to people like me advanced conventional training, so that I have to re-think everything I “knew” before. For example, the discussion of just what it means to “solve” an equation numerically is extraordinarily thought provoking. Another example is the author’s extended discussion of how calculus is not the best inspiration for computational numerical methods, even for problems that would seem to absolutely require calculus-based thinking, such as the solution of ordinary differential equations.

Not only is the content of the book brilliant, but so is the presentation. The text is so well written, a mix of clarity, precision, and reader friendliness that it is a pure pleasure to read, rather then the dense struggle that mathematical textbooks usually require of the reader. But in addition, almost every page has full color graphics and diagrams that are completely compelling in their ability to clearly communicate the ideas. I cannot think of any technical book I have ever seen that is so beautifully illustrated all the way through.

I should add that I read the Kindle edition on an iPad, and for once Amazon did not screw up the presentation of a technical book, at least for this platform. It is beautifully produced, in full color and detail, and with all of the fonts and graphics reproduced perfectly.

Dr. Gustafson has also provided a Mathematica implementation of unums and of the many numerical methods discussed in the book. Let us hope that in the next few years there will be implementations in other languages, followed by hardware implementations. Over time there should be unum arithmetic units alongside of floating point arithmetic units on every CPU and GPU chip, and in the long run unums should replace floating point entirely. The case the author makes for this is overwhelming.

If you are at all interested in computer arithmetic or numerical methods, read this book. It is destined to be a classic.",19
Paul M Sweazey,5.0 out of 5 stars,The End of Error: Unum Computing (Chapman & Hall/CRC Computational Science),"Amazing! A brilliant technical work and a ""page turner"" in the same book","Sure there will be naysayers, but 10 years from now we will look back to floating point as if it represented the dark ages. Structural engineering, Cosmology, and even high school calculus will be distinctly improved, startups will be born, and future generations will find that science and math are less baffling and more honest than today.

I bought this book because of my slight hope that it would show me an improved floating point variant. Instead I discovered a fundamental breakthrough. Gordon Bell says that the next step is implementation and testing that would lead to wide-scale adoption. I say, not would, but will. This book is easy to read, entertaining, and filled with surprises and revelations that keep you turning the pages.

I spent a career steering toward hardware architectures that could solve their problems using only integer data types, and away from problems without closed form solutions. This book helped me to understand what I feared and why. And now how do I feel? No project could be more satisfying than to build a unum processor.

Emeritus Professor, Lenore M. Mullin PhD
Department of Computer Science
University at Albany, SUNY
Scientist, and Consultant

I have spent my entire 35+ year career studying, programming (applications and systems) teaching, and researching scientific computing: algorithms, software, languages, hardware, design and verification). I have also worked and published with computer engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians. In addition, I have studied pedagogy and educational methods that work, e.g. “Guided Discovery” which contributed to my NSF Presidential Faculty Award ’92. It was from all these perspectives I read John’s book. Upon completion I felt this was one of the most profound books I have ever read from all perspectives and is a must read for anyone who seriously cares about how the computing industry is moving.

I always knew there was imprecision in the way numbers were represented but John made it very clear how serious, and dangerous, this imprecision is. Through color photos, factual examples, and humor, he presents how costly this imprecision has, is and will continue to be, unless something is done, and soon, as we depend more and more on computers to run our lives using Cyber Physical Systems and an Internet of Everything. Until now one might say the errors discussed in his book are only a few examples but I believe anyone can extrapolate those examples to include what might happen if automated cars or surgical tools go awry, when many lives are lost. Sometimes a loss of money can be shoved under the table when large companies can write off such losses, but lives cannot.

What was the most interesting thing about this book, besides the fact that we need a new look at how numbers are represented that guarantee accuracy and address the serious and dangerous issues mentioned above, is that it presented ideas using mathematics that most high school students can understand. Often scientific work is presented with such advanced mathematics that even when important the reader is turned off, and thus the impact is lost. Moreover, the use of color coding, and simple explanations are a pedagogically sound way of presenting even that. This is similarly true for software examples, which also can be a turn off to many readers.

His justification of unum computing is convincing from all perspectives. I personally do not know why every computing vendor, every funding agency, everyone who is writing simulations, is not demanding that this be done. Perhaps our complacency to change is the reason for this but it is time to take what we have learned and see that new directions are essential for progress, precision, and correct answers. It is also important to take the burden away from users who spend an enormous amount of time, wasted time, on such issues, when they can be using their scientific minds to do science, or any applications that care about numeric precision, e.g. the Stock Market as mentioned in the book.

Finally, he has built a simulator that is free to use and all the code is available in the book.
I applaud his brilliance and courage to shake up the industry and encourage everyone to run out and buy this book. You WILL be blown away.",5

idoubt_thr4_ithink,5.0 out of 5 stars,The End of Error: Unum Computing (Chapman & Hall/CRC Computational Science),"Amazing ...but, typo?","Just started reading this and I'm enjoying it very much. I've listened to one of Gustafson talks about unums and wondered if I wasn't witnessing a ""shaking of foundations"" of the caliber that Physics underwent with the Theory of Relativity 100 years ago.

That being said, though, I'm starting to believe there's a pretty major typo in the unum-to-real numbers formula in the pink box of section 4.9, at page 48 (this may actually originate from the formula at page 20 - pink box, bottom).

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong but the unum examples of pages 53 (bottom, the pi approximation) and 54 (top, -1) do not (seem to) verify with aforementioned formula of section 4.9. Both would verify, though, if the sign of the exponent following ""e"" would be plus instead of minus; i.e.,

x = (-1)^s * 2^(e + 2^(es-1)) * f / 2^fs, // plus!

instead of:

x = (-1)^s * 2^(e - 2^(es-1)) * f / 2^fs // not minus (?)

for e == 0 and similar for e!=0 case.

Also, for e == 0, with a ""minus"" (!?) it doesn't seem possible to represent numbers bigger than 1/2, because fractional part is multiplied by something at most 2^(-1) (possible less when es > 1).

Have I missed something, or there's a typo? Thanks in advance.

Tim Tyler,5.0 out of 5 stars,Probably Approximately Correct: Nature's Algorithms for Learning and Prospering in a Complex World,Evolution is not a form of learning: learning is a product of evolution,"This book is by a machine learning expert. He in interested in models of learning and particularly their assessment in terms of computational complexity theory. It considers seriously the role of evolution itself in the context of knowledge acquisition processes. The book argues that evolution is a subset of learning processes.

Overall, the book is a reasonable one. However, the presentation is a bit dry and boring. The author apparently likes coining terms, and dislikes reviewing the work of others. As Leslie says, there is indeed a close link between the theories of evolution and learning. He correctly argues against the modern dogma of directionless evolution (since evolution and learning are linked and learning is clearly directional). Leslie argues that ""fitness"" provides such a direction. In fact a much stronger case than the one Leslie gives can be made - based on thermodynamics.

Overall, I am inclined to think that the book has its core thesis backwards. Instead of evolution being a subset of learning processes, learning processes are part of evolution. Most of the rest of this review focuses on this one point, because I think it is an important one.

The idea that learning is a part of evolution is an old one. James Mark Baldwin proposed that organisms could learn a behavioural trait and then see genetic predispositions to learning that behaviour amplified by evolution. This idea was later generalised by Waddington - who proposed that genes could take over the trait completely - via a process known as ""genetic assimilation"". We see this effect in modern times, with learned milk drinking preceding genetically encoded lactose tolerance. Overall, the course of evolution is altered significantly by individual and social learning processes.

Leslie says that ""The idea that evolution is a form of learning sounds implausible to many people when they first hear it."" I think this is because he has things backwards - and learning is better seen as one of the products of evolution. How does Leslie argue that evolution is part of learning - and not the other way around? Leslie confines his attention to the case of ""Darwinian evolution"". According to Leslie, this term refers to evolution without learning. Leslie asserts that, in Darwinian evolution, genetic variations are generated independently of current experiences - a constraint that does not apply to learning systems. Unfortunately for Leslie's thesis, this isn't the kind of evolution that Darwin believed in. Darwin was well aware of the role of learning in evolution. Indeed he formulated a theory to explain how current experiences went on to affect the next generation. Darwin's proposed ""gemmules"" were subsequently discredited, but they clearly show that Darwin thought that current experiences influenced heritable variation.

Leslie goes on to describe modern cultural evolution, saying that ""culture also undergoes change or evolution, but this change is no longer limited by Darwinian principles"". However, Darwin was, in fact, a pioneer in the discovery of cultural evolution, writing about how words and languages were subject to natural selection. Leslie argues that human culture introduced learning to evolution. He minimizes the significance of cultural inheritance in other animals and the influence of individual learning on DNA evolution via the Baldwin effect and genetic assimilation. He says that before human culture: ""the learning and reasoning carried out by an organism during its life had limited impact that outlived the individual"". I think this is a big understatement that is not really consistent with the scientific evidence on the role of learning in evolution. Learning is important, and it's impact on evolution long pre-dates human cultural evolution.

The ""Darwinian evolution"" described by the author would have been foreign to Darwin. Also, we know that the idea that genetic variations are generated independently of current experiences is wrong - not least because of the role of stress in stimulating the production of mutations. This it isn't the kind of evolutionary theory that is much use for explaining what happens in nature. Why Leslie focuses on this impoverished version of evolutionary theory is not completely clear. Perhaps he really believes that this is what Darwinian evolutionary theory says. Or perhaps making Darwinism look weak makes his own field of learning seem more important.

So far, this has been mostly an argument over terminology - specifically over what the term ""Darwinian evolution"" refers to. This debate has limited interest - and can mostly be avoided with clear definitions. However the problem with learning theorists placing learning centrally and denigrating the power of Darwinian evolution, is that they then fail to make proper use of the insights evolutionary theory provides. In fact, Darwinism has much to say about how the brain processes responsible for animal learning work. Natural selection acts on synapses. Axon pulses are copied with variation and selection. There's competition between ideas within the brain for attention. The result is a good adaptive fit between an organism's model of its world and its environment. Interesting though these idea are, you won't find anything like them in this book. Indeed, few machine learning experts appear to have looked into the implications of modern versions of Darwinism. Instead, Leslie sees Darwinian evolution as a primitive ladder that led to modern learning systems.

Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Probably Approximately Correct: Nature's Algorithms for Learning and Prospering in a Complex World,Thought provoking learning theory for evolutionary biology,"When one is confronted with a “your money or your life” proposition from a gun-wielding thug in a dark alley, there is no temptation to poll the data on dark alley robberies in order to calculate the probability that the thief will pull the trigger. Unless one is trained to deal specifically with threats and stressful situations such as this, one quickly hands over the wallet or the purse. No sophisticated time intensive algorithms are in play in this situation. The pattern matching of the gun image and the affective capabilities of the brain take over here, provoking with incredible speed an appropriate fear response. The feedback received from this situation is that of walking away unscathed.

The point to be made here is that if one is to view the brain as a computational entity that deploys various algorithms to deal with situations like this and survival in general one must come to grips with the computational complexity of these algorithms. One must acknowledge that survival entails in many instances that thought processes operate on time scales that can are very short, as well as time scales that can be very long, i.e. require much deliberation and a quantitative assessment of risks.

The author of this book is well aware of the issues with computational complexity and via the idea (which he invented) of ‘probably approximately correct’ or PAC learning for short, has given the evolutionary biologists an interesting and provocative view of evolutionary processes that addresses some of the gaps in the Darwinian paradigm.

The book is highly interesting and its perusal will not only help the reader understand the issues at stake in the Darwinian view of evolution but will also assist the uninitiated reader in the understanding of PAC learning itself. In this regard the author devotes a portion of the book to PAC learning and examples are given that illustrate it. A very plausible case for the role of PAC learning in evolutionary process is outlined and should be understandable to anyone with even a modest background in computer science and mathematical logic. Readers with more background in learning theory and artificial intelligence can still appreciate the book even though the rigorous formalism has been omitted in order to appeal to a wider audience.

Whatever the eventual impact this book has on evolutionary biology it raises issues that should be addressed when contemplating the Darwinian paradigm, and beyond that it addresses requirements that every algorithm developer confronts in everyday practice. These involve the running time of algorithms designed for practical use, the data needed for these algorithms that can frequently be corrupted or sparse, and the overhead generated by the algorithm, especially those deployed on information networks.",2
Peter McCluskey,2.0 out of 5 stars,Probably Approximately Correct: Nature's Algorithms for Learning and Prospering in a Complex World,Forgettable,"This book provides some nonstandard perspectives on machine learning and evolution, but doesn't convince me there's much advantage to using those perspectives. I'm unsure how much of that is due to his mediocre writing style. He often seems close to saying something important, but never gets there.

He provides a rigorous meaning for the concept of learnability. I suppose that's important for something, but I can't recall what.

He does an ok job of explaining how evolution is a form of learning, but Eric Baum's book What is Thought? explains that idea much better.

The last few chapters, where he drifts farther from his areas of expertise, are worse. Much of what he says there only seems half-right at best.

One example is his suggestion that AI researchers ought to put a lot of thought into how teaching materials are presented (similar to how schools are careful to order a curriculum, from simple to complex concepts). I doubt that that reflects a reasonable model of human learning: children develop an important fraction of their intelligence before school age, with little guidance for the order in which they should learn concepts (cf. Piaget's theory of cognitive development); and unschooled children seem to choose their own curriculum.

My impression of recent AI progress suggests that a better organized ""curriculum"" is even farther from being cost-effective there - progress seems to be coming more from better ways of incorporating unsupervised learning.

I'm left wondering why anyone thinks the book is worth reading.",2
yanamal,3.0 out of 5 stars,Probably Approximately Correct: Nature's Algorithms for Learning and Prospering in a Complex World,Not quite what I was looking for.,"What I was expecting: a mostly-non-technical description of the ideas currently present in the various sub-fields of evolutionary computation, perhaps with elegant parallels drawn to the worlds of biology, cognitive science, genetics, etc.; in a way that such parallels might facilitate interesting thought on how this stuff works in general.

What this actually seems to be: a mostly-non-technical description of some of the author's own ostensibly new-ish theories based on some, but not all, of the things above; although I still can't quite understand where the precisely the novelty and the theories come in (or why he chose this format and audience to talk about them). The descriptions are not very precise (again, probably due to the non-technical tone/format/intended audience) The chapters that give the reader an overview of background topics *are* almost what I was looking for, although without the interesting synthesis of distinct but related fields.

What I'm confused about: the apparent lack of distinction being drawn between Machine Learning principles and Genetic Algorithm principles, either in the book or in the reviews, given that the ideas from genetics are closer to, well, genetic algorithms; whereas the parallels drawn are mostly to machine learning.

ubpdqn,3.0 out of 5 stars,Probably Approximately Correct: Nature's Algorithms for Learning and Prospering in a Complex World,Interesting bok,"This is a very interesting book. The author presents the case for ecorithms (algorithms, heuristics perhaps) that could explain and ultimately allow quantitative assessment and testable predictions of the mechanisms (and timescale) of evolution and one of its most “mysterious” byproducts consciousness/cognition (I should perhaps not conflate these two).

The author looks at the central problem of evaluating and decision making based on incomplete information, small empirical samples and within biological and physical constraints and be successful. The linear/polynomial time algorithms (using the generalized concept of computation: universal Turing machines) for learning from inputs from external environments in a “theory-less” context could lead to “probably approximately correct” classifications, decisions and actions and be explanatory for evolution and perhaps human learning and human cultural evolution (with the latter having Lamarckian as well Darwinian aspects).

The book explores these matters through the lens of computer science (the author’s expertise). This is a very interesting and instructive perspective. The limits, and similarities and contrasts between computer systems and algorithms was well presented.

I think this book fits nicely with Penrose “Emperor’s New Mind” (which argues for non-algorithmic apsects to consciousness and learning), Kahneman’s “Thinking Fast and Slow” which explores the limitations of human reason (our hard wiring for making fast decisions with limited information but our limitations in statistical and probabilistic reasoning) and Silver’s “The Signal and the Noise”.

I had (and continue) to think hard about the concepts in the book. It is, however, I believe a very refreshing viewpoint to seek to explain the gaps in evolution, cognition and learning. The author ends by looking at issues of artificial intelligence and why this has been more challenging than anticipated and the authors appeal to reason in relation to fears about a ‘Sky-net’ future was very interesting. The integration of external inputs, the central role of learning, the power of inductive reasoning in and the need for composite induction and deductive reasoning (the latter indispensible for what the author calls theory-ful contexts) are all part of the authors rich explanation…it seemed to me “probably approximately correct”.",2

Mario Schlosser,4.0 out of 5 stars,Probably Approximately Correct: Nature's Algorithms for Learning and Prospering in a Complex World,Great thought starter on applying machine learning to evolution,"In short: whether you're a computer scientist familiar with machine learning algorithms, or whether you don't know much about artificial intelligence, this book has profound and novel insights to offer. I've been a practitioner of machine learning for a long time, and yet the book's framework relating machine learning to evolution gave me a whole bunch of ""aha"" moments. So pick it up and give it a read.

The book's thesis in a few words: cognitive concepts are computational, and they are acquired by a learning process, before and after birth. Nature, the grand designer, uses ecorithms to guide this process - systems whose functioning and whose parameters are learned and evolved, as opposed to written down once (like algorithms). The processes of learning, evolution and reasoning are the building blocks of ecorithms.

This, in and of itself, is not a new framework. Open any artificial intelligence textbook, and the table of contents will be organized into algorithms for ""learning"" and ""reasoning"". So nothing new there. But then, the book launches into an excellent, simple and mind-blowing thought experiment: what if nature were simply relying on the same simple learning algorithms that we as humans have been researching, with the same constraints - and evolution is just that formal learning process in action? And then: given all we know about the parameters of these learning algorithms, would evolution have been mathematically possible?

To answer that, the author goes into some detail on computational complexity theory. Computer science has shown that there are many seemingly simple processes that aren't solvable in polynomial time - meaning, if you make them big enough, solving them will take longer than the universe existed. The question of the shortest overall path in visiting all cities in a particular geography is such a problem. So if it is so easy to mathematically prove that so many really simple problems aren't solvable in the time the universe existed, how would it even be remotely possible that evolution build something as complex as the human brain in an even shorter time frame?

The book then essentially explores areas of machine learning just deep enough to show that it probably would be possible. There are enough real-world functions of the ""probably approximately correct""-learnable class that are learnable in polynomial time, and algorithms that do the learning that we already know (and use) today, that it's imaginable that nature relies on variants of those. The book has some strong tidbits it throws out in the course of discussing this. For example, it turns out that parity functions (deciding, without counting, whether something is odd or even) aren't PAC-learnable. So far, so satisfying a read.

One of the book's drawbacks is that a lot of the details are left open. In the author's thesis, the genome and our protein networks somehow encode the parameters of the learning algorithms nature uses. But of course we have no idea how that actually happens (and the book doesn't pretend that it knows). Another drawback is that the book seemingly can't quite decide on its audience: is it pop science or more serious work? It oscillates strangely between being very concrete and being hand-wavy: for example, when discussing the limits of machine learning (semantics, brittleness, complexity, grounding), there isn't anything offered in terms of why machine learning is so brittle (just try Apple's Siri). It also somewhat casually throws around ideas that are mind-blowing but totally unproven: for example, it is known that our working memory can only hold 7 +/- 2 objects at any point in time. The author argues that this is by design, so that the subsequent learning algorithms have an easier time picking up features. That's a pretty cool line of thinking, because it would suggest that nature uses the same heuristics that we as computer scientists use when tackling a learning problem (reduction in features and dimensionality). But it's also totally unproven that THIS is why we have limited working memory, or that THIS is what it does. The book also doesn't go into any depths on learning algorithms we already know, even though a lot of the known algorithms actually have pretty simple intuitions underlying them that could nicely be treated for a non-computer science audience.

But overall, there are some awesome thought starters in this book. It is not always an easy read. But certainly worth it.",28

Shubhendu Trivedi,3.0 out of 5 stars,Probably Approximately Correct: Nature's Algorithms for Learning and Prospering in a Complex World,"""Biological evolution is a form of Computational Learning"" Popular Science version","Edit: This review is too long as I tried to summarize the main ideas in the book as well. This is in the middle of the review. If you are looking for a shorter review the first three and the last paragraphs should suffice.

The punchline of this book is perhaps: ""Changing or increasing functionality of circuits in biological evolution is a form of computational learning""; although it also speaks of topics other than evolution, the underlying framework is of the Probably Approximately Correct model from the theory of Machine Learning, from which the book gets its name.

I had first heard of this explicit connection between Machine Learning and Evolution in 2010 and have been quite fascinated by it since. It must be noted, however, that similar ideas have appeared in the past. It won't be incorrect to say that usually they have been in the form of metaphor. It is another matter that this metaphor has generally been avoided for various reasons in scientific discourse. When I first heard about the idea it immediately made sense and like all great ideas, in hindsight looks completely obvious. Ergo, I was quite excited to see this book and preordered it months in advance.

This book is basically a popular science version and expansion of the ideas on the matter that appeared in a J-ACM article titled ""Evolvability"" in 2007. If you are looking for a technical coverage look elsewhere. Infact a monograph on the recently developing COLT based approaches to evolution does not exist yet (this gap needs to be filled!). I had been thinking that this book might be an informal plug into this gap and hence I have to say that I was rather disappointed that it wasn't. Don't get me wrong, the book is not bad, infact pretty good. Just that somebody with enough background in Learning might not be able to get enough out of it. It might however be a good starting book for those interested in these ideas but without much background in both subjects.

Before attempting to sketch a skiagram of the main content of the book: One of the main subthemes of the book, constantly emphasized is to look at computer science as a kind of an enabling tool to study natural science. This is oft ignored, perhaps because of the reason that CS curricula are rarely designed with any natural science component in them and hence there is no impetus for aspiring computer scientists to view them from the computational lens. On the other hand, the relation of computer science with mathematics has become quite well established. As a technology the impact of Computer Science has been tremendous. All this is quite remarkable given the fact that just about a century ago the notion of a computation was not even well defined. Unrelated to the book: More recently people have started taking the idea of digital physics (i.e. physics from a solely computable/digital perspective) seriously. But in the other natural sciences its usage is still woeful. Valiant draws upon the example of Alan Turing as a natural scientist and not just as a computer scientist to make this point. Alan Turing was more interested in natural phenomenon (intelligence, limits of mechanical calculation, pattern formation etc) and used tools from Computer Science to study them, a fact that is evident from his publications. That Turing was trying to understand natural phenomenon was remarked in his obituary by Max Neumann by summarizing the body of his work as: ""the extent and the limitations of mechanistic explanations of nature"".
--
The book begins with a delightful and quite famous quote by John von Neumann (through this paragraph I also discovered the context to the quote). This paragraph also adequately summarizes the motivation for the book very well:

""In 1947 John von Neumann, the famously gifted mathematician, was keynote speaker at the first annual meeting of the Association for Computng Machinery. In his address he said that future computers would get along with just a dozen instruction types, a number known to be adequate for expressing all of mathematics. He went on to say that one need not be surprised at this small number, since 1000 words were known to be adequate for most situations in real life, and mathematics was only a small part of life, and a very simple part at that. The audience responded with hilarity. This provoked von Neumann to respond: ""If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is""

Though counterintuitive, von Neumann's quip contains an obvious truth. Einstein's theory of general relativity is simple in the sense that one can write the essential content on one line as a single equation. Understanding its meaning, derivation, and consequences requires more extensive study and effort. However, this formal simplicity is striking and powerful. The power comes from the implied generality, that knowledge of one equation alone will allow one to make accurate predictions about a host of situations not even connected when the equation was first written down.

Most aspects of life are not so simple. If you want to succeed in a job interview, or in making an investment, or in choosing a life partner, you can be quite sure that there is no equation that will guarantee you success. In these endeavors it will not be possible to limit the pieces of knowledge that might be relevant to any one definable source. And even if you had all the relevant knowledge, there may be no surefire way of combining it to yield the best decision.

This book is predicated on taking this distinction seriously [...]""

In a way, aspects of life as mentioned above appear theoryless, in the sense that there seems to be no mathematical or scientific theory like relativity for them. Something which is quantitative, definitive and short. Note that these are generally not ""theoryless"" in the sense that there exists no theory at all since obviously people can do all the tasks mentioned in a complex world quite effectively. A specific example is of how organisms adapt and species evolve without having a theory of the environment as such. How can such coping mechanisms come into being in the first place is the main question asked in the book.

Let's stick to the specific example of biological evolution. Clearly, it is one of the central ideas in biology and perhaps one of the most important theories in science that changed the way we look at the world. But inspite of its importance, Valiant claims (and correctly in my opinion) that evolution is not understood well in a quantitative sense. Evidence that convinces us of its correctness is of the following sort: Biologists usually show a sequence of evolving objects; stages, where the one coming later is more complex than the previous. Since this is studied mostly via the fossil record there is always a lookout for missing links between successive stages. Darwin had remarked that numerous successive paths are necessary - that is, if it was not possible to trace a path from an earlier form to a more complicated form then it was hard to explain how it came about. But again, as Valiant stresses, this is not really an explanation of evolution. It is more of an ""existence proof"" and not a quantitative explanation. That is, even if there is evidence for the existence of a path, one can't really say that a certain path is likely to be followed just because it exists.

Related to this, one of the first questions that one might ask, and indeed was asked by Darwin himself: Why has evolution taken as much time as it has? How much time would have sufficed for all the complexity that we see around us to evolve? This question infact bothered Darwin a lot in his day. In On the Origins of Species he originally gave an estimate of the Earth's age to be at least 300 million years, implying indirectly, that there was enough time. This estimate was immediately thrashed by Lord Kelvin, one of the pre-eminent British physicists of the time, who estimated the age of the Earth to be only about 24 million years. This caused Darwin to withdraw the estimate from his book. However, this estimate greatly worried Darwin as he thought 24 million years just wasn't enough time. To motivate on the same theme Valiant writes the following:

""[...] William Paley, in a highly influential book, Natural Theology (1802) , argued that life, as complex as it is, could not have come into being without the help of a designer. Numerous lines of evidence have become available in the two centuries since, through genetics and the fossil record, that persuade professional biologists that existing life forms on Earth are indeed related and have indeed evolved. This evidence contradicts Paley's conclusion, but it does not directly address his argument. A convincing direct counterargument to Paley's would need a specific evolution mechanism to be demonstrated capable of giving rise to the quantity and quality of the complexity now found in biology, within the time and resources believed to have been available. [...]""

A specific, albeit more limited version of this question might be: Consider the human genome, which has about 3 billion base pairs. Now, if evolution is a search problem, as it naturally appears to be, then why did the evolution of this genome not take exponential time? If it would have taken exponential time then clearly such evolution could not have happened in any time scale since the origin of the earth. Thus, a more pointed question to ask would be: What circuits could evolve in sub-exponential time (and on a related note, what circuits are evolvable only in exponential time?). Given the context, the idea of thinking about this in circuits might seem a little foreign. But on some more thought it is quite clear that the idea of a circuit is natural when it comes to modeling such systems (at least in principle). For example: One might think of the genome as a circuit, just as how one might think of the complex protein interaction networks and networks of neurons in the brain as circuits that update themselves in response to the environment.

The last line is essentially the key idea of adaptation, that entities interact with the environment and update themselves (hopefully to cope better) in response. But the catch is that the world/environment is far too complex for simple entities (relatively speaking), with limited computational power, to have a theory for. Hence, somehow the entity will have to cope without really ""understanding"" the environment (it can only be partially modeled) and improve their functionality. The key thing to pay attention here is the interaction or the interface between the limited computational entity in question and the environment. The central idea in Valiant's thesis is to think of and model this interaction as a form of computational learning. The entity will absorb information about the world and ""learn"" so that in the future it ""can do better"". A lot of Biology can be thought of as the above: Complex behaviours in environments. Wherein by complex behaviours we mean that in different circumstances, we (or alternately our limited computational entity) might behave completely differently. Complicated in the sense that there can't possibly be a look up table for modeling such complex interactions. Such interactions-responses can just be thought of as complicated functions e.g. how would a deer react could be seen as a function of some sensory inputs. Or for another example: Protein circuits. The human body has about 25000 proteins. How much of a certain protein is expressed is a function depending on the quantities of other proteins in the body. This function is quite complicated, certainly not something like a simple linear regression. Thus there are two main questions to be asked: One, how did these circuits come into being without there being a designer to actually design them? Two, How do such circuits maintain themselves? That is, each ""node"" in protein circuits is a function and as circumstances change it might be best to change the way they work. How could have such a thing evolved?

Given the above, one might ask another question: At what rate can functionality increase or adapt under the Darwinian process? Valiant (like many others, such as Chaitin.) comes to the conclusion that the Darwinian evolution is a very elegant computational process. And since it is so, with the change in the environment there has to be a quantitative way of saying how much rate of change can be kept up with and what environments are unevolvable for the entity. It is not hard to see that this is essentially a question in computer science and no other discipline has the tools to deal with it.

In so far that (biological) interactions-responses might be thought of as complicated functions and that the limited computational entity that is trying to cope has to do better in the future, this is just machine learning! This idea, that changing or increasing functionality of circuits in biological evoution is a form of computational learning, is perhaps very obvious in hindsight. This (changing functionality) is done in Machine Learning in the following sense: We want to acquire complicated functions without explicitly programming for them, from examples and labels (or ""correct"" answers). This looks at exactly at the question at how complex mechanisms can evolve without someone designing it (consider a simple perceptron learning algorithm for a toy example to illustrate this). In short: We generate a hypothesis and if it doesn't match our expectations (in performance) then we update the hypothesis by a computational procedure. Just based on a single example one might be able to change the hypothesis. One could draw an analogy to evolution where ""examples"" could be experiences, and the genome is the circuit that is modified over a period of time. But note that this is not how it looks like in evolution because the above (especially drawing to the perceptron example) sounds more Lamarckian. What the Darwinian process says is that we don't change the genome directly based on experiences. What instead happens is that we make a lot of copies of the genome which are then tested in the environment with the better one having a higher fitness. Supervised Machine Learning as drawn above is very lamarckian and not exactly Darwinian.

Thus, there is something unsatisfying in the analogy to supervised learning. There is a clear notion of a target in the same. Then one might ask, what is the target of evolution? Evolution is thought of as an undirected process. Without a goal. This is true in a very important sense however this is incorrect. Evolution does not have a goal in the sense that it wants to evolve humans or elephants etc. But it certainly does have a target. This target is ""good behaviour"" (where behaviour is used very loosely) that would aid in the survival of the entity in an environment. Thus, this target is the ""ideal"" function (which might be quite complicated) that tells us how to behave in what situation. This is already incorporated in the study of evolution by notions such as fitness that encode that various functions are more beneficial. Thus evolution can be framed as a kind of machine learning problem based on the notion of Darwinian feedback. That is, make many copies of the ""current genome"" and let the one with good performance in the real world win. More specifically, this is a limited kind of PAC Learning. If you call your current hypothesis your genome, then your genome does not depend on your experiences. Variants to this genome are generated by a polynomial time randomized Turing Machine. To illuminate the difference with supervised learning, we come back to a point made earlier that PAC Learning is essentially Lamarckian i.e. we have a hidden function that we want to learn. One however has examples and labels corresponding to this hidden function, these could be considered ""queries"" to this function. We then process these example/label pairs and learn a ""good estimate"" of this hidden function in polynomial time. It is slightly different in Evolvability. Again, we have a hidden ""ideal"" function f(x). The examples are genomes. However, how we can find out more about the target is very limited, since one can empirically only observe the aggregate goodness of the genome (a performance function). The task then is to mutate the genome so that it's functionality improves. So the main difference with the usual supervised learning is that one could query the hidden function in a very limited way: That is we can't act on a single example and have to take aggregate statistics into account.

Then one might ask what can one prove using this model? Valiant demonstrates some examples. For example, Parity functions are not evolvable for uniform distribution while monotone disjunctions are actually evolvable. This function is ofcourse very non biological but it does illustrate the main idea: That the ideal function together with the real world distribution imposes a fitness landscape and that in some settings we can show that some functions can evolve and some can not. This in turn illustrates that evolution is a computational process independent of substrate.

In the same sense as above it can be shown that Boolean Conjunctions are not evolvable for all distributions. There has also been similar work on real valued functions off late which is not reported in detail in the book. Another recent work that is only mentioned in passing towards the end is the study of multidimensional space of actions that deal with sets of functions (not just one function) that might be evolvable together. This is an interesting line of work as it is pretty clear that biological evolution deals with the evolution of a set of functions together and not functions in isolation.

I think the book is pretty decent. Although it might be disappointing if you went in looking for a more technical treatment; especially if you come from a learning background. Like I mentioned at the onset of this (long) review: Clearly this book is aimed at the non expert/relatively uninitiated. To me personally, this recent area of work that studies evolution through the lens of computational learning is incredibly interesting and intellectually stimulating. Precisely for this reason, I had been hoping for more. On criticisms: I have noticed substantial critcism by some biologists of some of the main ideas in the book (not just writing style etc). Some of the criticism might be valid but quite some of it is phrased as: ""Valiant needs to understand biology better"". I think remarks of this nature are more due to the fact that (most, not all) biologists do not have the computational and algorithmic lens to look at certain problems in an abstract setting. Yes, I am saying that the problem is with them and not Valiant. Criticisms about writing are another matter entirely and orthogonal to the critcisms of the nature mentioned above. In my opinion some of these ideas that started out in 2007 (incipient versions can be seen in the work of John Maynard Smith decades ago. see ""Evolution of Sex"".), and also presented informally in this book will have a lasting impact. On other criticisms: I have had some arguments about the main ideas in the book over the past couple of years with some biologist friends who take the usage of ""learning"" to mean that what is implied is that evolution is a directed process. It would have been great if the book would have spent more time on this particular aspect. Also, the book explicitly states that it is about quantitative aspects of evolution and has nothing to do with speciation, population dynamics and other rich areas of study. It ONLY deals with what Valiant says is the essence of evolution, which is an elegant and abstract computational process. However, I have already seen some criticism of the book on this premise. So in this sense I believe that these criticisms are unfair.

As far as I am concerned, as an admirer of Prof. Leslie Valiant's range and quality of contributions, I would have preferred if the book went into more depth. Just to have a semi-formal monograph on the study of evolution using the tools of PAC Learning right from the person who initiated this area of study. However this is just a selfish consideration.",3
A. Menon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Probably Approximately Correct: Nature's Algorithms for Learning and Prospering in a Complex World,Complicated book about the form of evolutionary computation,"Probably Approximately Correct is an attempt to explore what might go into the computation undertaken in evolutionary and learning processes. It is mathematical in nature and argument but this book is from a very high level and uses more symbolic arguments rather than specific mathematical ones. Though readable there is a lot of the material which is really tough to digest with the writing quite terse at times. I think there is a lot of depth in the book that can be appreciated by reading slowly and with consideration such that one can get a sense of what is going on in the study of intelligence and learning, from a formal computational standpoint and how it might relate to humanity. One also gets a sense of the true difficulty in the programming of intelligence and an appreciation of the breadth of the meaning of intelligence.

The book assumes no prior knowledge but I think if you are unfamiliar with theories of computation it gets very difficult to follow very quickly. In any case the author starts out by describing prediction and adaptation and quickly gets into the theory of computation. He discusses computability from the perspective of Turing and goes into the completeness of the framework. It discusses P/NP issues and the need for his ""ecorithm"" concept to be in the space of polynomial time algorithms. This is required for the self evident reason that we've evolved on such a time scale. He ends with an introduction to the Perceptron Algorithm and discusses how the simple adaptive algorithm can have strong properties that translate to how people can learn.

The author gets into learning and evolution in the two next chapters. Each are separate but ultimately very connected. Learning is considered more local in time and self adapting in nature such that the greater fitness of learning translates into the evolutionary timescale. The author discusses the concept of probably approximately correct algorithms and how they can function in a variable environment. The author discusses how algorithms can be seen as ways to enhance prediction by minimizing errors if there is regularity in the environment. This is all kind of fuzzy to be honest as its not formalized mathematically but its described as though it can be. The author discusses teaching and learning as well and how teaching is different from programming. A teacher can will have imperfect knowledge of the student but can still teach them whereas a programmer needs much more complete knowledge of the program to improve it). The author moves into evolution and discusses the computational needs for evolution to have arrived where we are today. In particular the author gets into some big picture ideas on computation within evolution and into the time scale and the fitness functions within the mathematical space that the author is considering. This is done in descriptive terms rather than in a formulaic sense.

The author moves onto syllogism vs induction. Evolutionary learning is considered within the space of theoryless learning, ie we use heuristics to recognize patterns and act and adapt as a function of those heuristics rather than from a deduced bottom up construction of reality. With this backdrop the author argues our learning process is based on a largely theoryless base. The challenges of reasoning in the theoryless space include complexity, brittleness and semantics. The fact that we can only keep in our immediate short term memory/focus 7 ideas (+/- 2) is given to remind us of our limited field of vision we possess when considering problems in general.

The author moves from setting the stage to formulating the thesis- humans are manifestations of these ecorithms that he has been describing. He discusses cognitive science and the biases we have and how our contextual truths will never translate perfectly. At the same time our innate ecorithm machinery means some does translate well between us and computer science/machine learning. Bridging the computational benefits of computers with human pattern recognition can enhance our functionality for a broad class of problem solving. Here we get a sense of the difficulty in programming intelligence. We don't know the functional forms that go into the learning that we are able to do, hence to program them is currently unfeasible. At the same time progress has been made in narrow areas and those do give some insight into some basic forms of machine learning.

All in all i got some interesting perspective from this book but its really tough to follow closely. I think if you know a lot about algorithms then talking about the algorithms alluded to and what they look like in functional form makes it easier to appreciate the space of outcomes that are possible with such algorithms. Seeing graphs of how learning algorithms can solve simple puzzles through trial and error might have been helpful rather than the 30k foot view. Through reading this, one gets a sense of human complexity but also on how maybe there is a simplicity to it as well. I recommend reading Connectome: How the Brain's Wiring Makes Us Who We Are to get a sense of how complicated the brain is, as to appreciate the difficulty in writing algorithms to describe it. I'm no expert in either what the author does or what the author of Connectome does, so i might be talking apples to oranges. Either way, i recommend the book, but prepare to be confused in many places.",7

Let's Compare Options Preptorial,5.0 out of 5 stars,Probably Approximately Correct: Nature's Algorithms for Learning and Prospering in a Complex World,"Outstanding, too short, you'll want more!","Talk about fuzzy logic on steroids! After reading the subtleties of this ""math"" book (translate: studying-- every sentence is so PACKED with insights, that you can't really just speed ""read"" this), you'll be stunned, and hungry for a LOT more. In a very short couple hundred pages, the author integrates everything you've always wondered about how Godel, Cellular Automata / the game of life, thousand page programs of differential equations reduced to two algorithmic lines, Darwinism applied to a new definition of computer learning, etc., relate to each other! The subtitle of the book should be ""non expert generic learning algorithms"" or ""Darwinian computers"" or something unprecedented like that. You'll even learn why we can't put Sherlock Holmes' brain in an algorithm.

In brilliant fashion, Valiant twines natural (as in nature) problem solving and learning with the algorithmic processes of neural learning, and potentially machine learning (redefined), and sneakily hints at how the brain can process systems of dynamic partial diffential equations as matrix calculus without us even knowing it! If you've ever wondered how your brain can hold dual uncertainties (time/motion or frequency/time etc.) constant with PDE's (Fourier transforms) as you cross a street, without your ""conscious"" mind even being able to solve a partial differential without peeking at the text examples (let alone a Fourier inverse), this amazing book finally gives the closest I've ever seen to a believable answer. WOW are we EVER smart without ""knowing"" it!!! One of the many ""ahas"" is how ""non experts"" (eg our ""conscious"" brains) can invent things like calculus.

There's no advanced LaTex such as complex exponential superscript equations for e-readers to bugger up, so don't hesitate to get this on Kindle. There are polynomials and subscripts, but my Fire digested them just fine. A few of the many diagrams, tables and illustrations are too tiny to view, but a double tap takes care of that. Yes, the underlying math ""discussed"" really is post grad in some cases, but the author doesn't burden us with that level of notation, choosing instead to describe verbally (and with at most inequalities and a few polynomials and tables) the much simpler underlying ""ecorithm"" (algorithms that learn from their environment).

This book is relevant on too many levels to thoroughly list, but just a few include psych, engineering, algorithms, computational complexity, machine learning, AI, dynamic systems, education, consciousness, neurology, math... and onward. For non math major ""lay"" readers, the text is crisp, clear, readable/studyable with a nice pace and stories/illustrations that make it an unlikely but well written page turner. Strangely also, I truly believe it will appeal to both lay and pro readers/researchers -- the author strikes a very unusual balance with deep computational examples while not coming off as a show off-- one of the best teachers you'll ever want to meet, or if you're a technical author, emulate.

A bunch of books have now been written about how algorithms are taking over the world-- and how ""unseen robots"" (smart phones, cars and 777's) really are ""thinking."" This is better than the whole group of them combined! If you want a peek into your great great grandkids' planet-- get this asap! There are sincerely numerous new insights - discoveries - revelations on each page. The connections described are being researched in many fields right now, but silos prevent a lot of the overlaps between disciplines this author has spotted. They say Poincaire was the last great generalist-- this book makes me wonder. Even so, the author is humble in asking us to question HIS insights and discoveries every time he posits one as novel-- a true scholar.

A NOTE ABOUT COPING: Do NOT mistake the publisher's statements about ""how to cope"" with some self help promo or advice book. This is a very well written, but technical book about learning algorithms (usually relatively short ""guiding"" programs that tell other programs what to do), NOT coping in the usual sense of getting by strategies. Coping here refers more to how algorithms and organisms (yes, including us) can ""navigate"" environments too complex to understand, with shortcuts and guesstimates that work practically.

bill h,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Algorithms with C: Useful Techniques from Sorting to Encryption,Good for those inexperienced with C,"I'm new to C, but not to programming in general.

First, my five stars is kind of dependent upon the audience. You shouldn't buy this to teach yourself algorithms, it isn't a textbook. Instead it's quite good as a reference book for how algorithms you know pseudo for should be properly implemented in C. It's also enormously useful for data structure implementation, which can be tricky if you come from mainly using a language without pointers.

The only downside is its bigger than necessary due to comment size, but unlike others I don't think the book should really be judged on editor induced padding. It's a solid reference with excellent diagrams and clear explanations.",3
Michael Gautier,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Algorithms with C: Useful Techniques from Sorting to Encryption,"Diverse Areas, Common Solutions","You will see how seemingly unrelated areas of technology can be approached in similar ways. The kind of thinking expressed in the book may apply to topics as diverse as social networks, databases, healthcare systems, air traffic control, video games, robots, drones and mobile apps. Kyle reveals an approach that can improve code reuse, the way code runs, and how the code is fundamentally structured. The code is example code, not real-world code. That means that the code clearly shows the approach to solving a problem so you know how the solution in code may appear. You will still have to adjust the code for style, performance, and security. Importantly, he explains various approaches very well, includes diagrams and uses the C programming language for code examples which makes the code translatable to Java, C++, and PHP. It takes patience and attention to progress through 17 chapters, but the results are well worth it. Can you read the book once? You can as an overview and to become more broadly familiar with the material, but it is definitely a worthwhile reference.",2

Though it is no fault of the book, the code referenced in the book is provided on a 3.5 inch floppy disk -- which I can't really use on my modern system without buying a USB floppy drive.

My criticism would be if you didn't know an algorithm at all, it can be a bit rough to get the exact details -- and given the large amount of code in the book, I suppose the author expects you to fill in the details by reading the code. This probably makes it inferior to other books for /learning/, but again, if you're just reviewing, this isn't really a problem.",3

Anish Joseph,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies, and the Future of Human Intelligence",Mind-bendingly Enjoyable,"In his book Natural Born Cyborgs, Andy Clark supports a view of human-machine symbiosis that puts our recent integration with computer interfaces on a continuum of human evolutionary development along with ""clothes, cooking, bricklaying, and writing."" Through his writing the author makes the case to support this view in which he systematically lays out a foundation for readers to see things from his perspective. Overall the book is written very well. I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind, some background in technology/neuroscience and a general interest in thinking about how we, in effect, have developed as human beings throughout the course of history.

After first introducing the book by playing off of our fear of the fictional cyborgs we all know from the movies ie Terminator, Eve 8, Cable - the book begins with a brief introduction of the author's background; Andy Clark claims that it was during his time directing a new interdisciplinary program in philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology that he first realized this concept of ""cyborg"" that he details in this book. From here he introduces the idea of humans being intrinsically technology dependent beings. He states that his goal in writing such a book is ""to hijack that image (our preconceived notion of cyborg) and to reshape it, revealing it as a disguised vision of our own biological nature."" What really impressed me about his style of argument and writing was his use of examples from research in many different fields to illustrate his point. Where many times we see arguments like his fall into ambiguity and opinion, his use of concrete examples helps paint the picture of the story he tells.

The book itself is very short, consisting of only 8 chapters, however every chapter has been thoroughly annotated so readers can dive deeper if they wish. For the sake of my synopsis I've divided the book into two halves.

Chapters 1-3
The first chapter of the book is spent educating the reader on where the term cyborg originally came from putting it in the context of the first early technologies which ""sought to incorporate exogenous components extending the self-regulating control function of the organism in order to adapt it to new environments"" Here Clark cites early osmotic pumps, auditory prosthetics, and peripheral nerve interfaces. The focus of this chapter is to draw out what Clark calls ""an ancient western prejudice"" which creates the illusionary belief that the mind is distinctly different from the rest of natural order. Instead of viewing technology as something distinct from our human nature he argues that technology is integrated and always has been integrated with our nature placing us in our current condition at a transition point between first wave (pen,paper,diagram, and digital media) and second wave (personalized, online, dynamic biotechnological unions) technologies. The cell phone is the technology he uses as an example of this transition.

Moving from the concrete into more abstract realms Andy Clark then introduces the idea of transparent and opaque technologies before diving into his categorization of technologies, which he labels ""ready-to-hand"" and ""present-at-hand."" In categorizing the way people perceive and interact with technologies Clark attempts to bring some level of awareness to how we as lay people may simply generalize and interact with technologies and our environment taking what we have right in front of us for granted. The importance of understanding concepts such as these are again driven home using experimental example - in this case the ability of chimps who are trained to reason symbolically vs chimps who are not. Andy uses this example to make his point that only the chimps who were trained to reason symbolically were then able to understand higher order relationships - what he calls the relation between relations.

Chapters 4-8
Once laying out this abstract scaffold for his argument Andy Clark gets into his answers to bigger questions: Where are we? and What are we?. Here he takes the reader through reported experiments and experiences, which alter human perception through illusions and the use of technology based telepresence to play with the idea of embodied consciousness. From here he explores the application and ethics of such technologies for the future of mankind. Andy Clark takes a look at how this knowledge is already currently being used through computational application dipping into the darker areas of misuse of such information/technology. He ends this section making the point that it is not technology itself that is evil; it's how the technology is used. In conclusion Andy Clark argues that it's not the preconceived invasive and material tools themselves that make us cyborgs rather it's the extended thinking systems that are created as a result of these tools that make us who we are.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I especially liked the importance he gives to interdisciplinary perspectives. Through the experience of working on constructing an interdisciplinary research program at Georgia Tech under Dr. Steve Potter I came to notice and support many of the ideas presented here. What impressed me most about the book was the amazing job the author does in translating ideas to the reader through examples while at the same time demonstrating the concept in the structure of his writing. For example in introducing the idea of the symbolically reasoning chimps he is setting up the scaffold to introduce his concept of scaffolded thinking.

The biggest problem I can see readers having with this book is what can appear as Andy Clark's loose use of what he defines as a technology. Because he is speaking of technology in both a physical and metaphysical sense I can see many readers having a hard time accepting the case that he makes if they do not consider what he has to say carefully. If the reader does buy into Clark's definition, this book is an amazing source of perspective on how we as human beings have grown in an interlocked web of biology and technology. In my opinion what Andy Clark talks about in this book has incredible application in models of education and perspective regardless of opinion on the monistic, dualist, or pluralist nature of the world.",1
Kjell Oevergaard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies, and the Future of Human Intelligence",Cyborgs in the Flesh,"Clark presents an argument that we do not need to implant microchips or electronic prostheses in our body to become Cyborgs, - We are already Cyborgs. The argument is based in our natural ability to use tools and technics to enhance our capabilities for movement, cognition and perception.

The book is easy to read and draws upon research from the fields of robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, cybernetics, dynamic systems theory, feminist theory, cognitive anthropology and english litterature studies.

The fact that he draws upon such diverse fields of research does not reduce the logic or persuasiveness of his arguments, but rather show the interdisciplinary basis for the book. The breadth of the arguments' basis is a major plus with this book, showing that the interplay between humans and technology are not merely technical but also something which changes who we are and how we understand our selves.",2
Joshua,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,This is a great intro to complexity theory,"This is a great intro to complexity theory, though expensive for my tastes. I bought it for an autonama class, never read it during the class, but came back to it for the special topics.

This only dips into the special topics, but introduces many of the important classes, and their relation to other complexity classes. Such classes as L, BPP, IP, Alternating, NC, and of course P, NP, exptime, PSPACE, and more.

It is very well written. It ussually explains the proof ideas before starting, and gives detailed proofs. If you can afford it, this book makes a great intro to complexity theory.

However, this is an intro. This book does not discuss advanced topics in depth, just enough to understand the most common comexity classes and their known relationships.",1
EJS,2.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,Not detailed enough,"Given the fact that this is considered one of the ""standard"" reference books, I was surprisingly unimpressed with this book.

There are a number of complaints I have about this book:
1. Its price is just obscene - the fact that they would charge that much for a book that a lot of people are forced to purchase is just wrong on the face of it.
2. The lousy price is especially irritating given what you get for it. Fact is, even at a much lower price this textbook would be a bad value. At a mere 480 pages, this is not an especially long textbook; not sure how the publisher can possibly justify charging an above-average price for a shorter-than-average textbook. There's really nothing I can think of that would justify this book's price tag; it's not like they add some fabulous feature (software package, etc.) that makes this book worth the extra money. I suppose it's more of a ""they charge it because they can"" type scenario.
3. Not only is it overpriced, it's not even particularly well written. Quite bluntly, the book's relatively short because it doesn't explain anything.

With regards to the third point, I completely agree with the other reviewer who commented that this book is written as if you already understood the material; this is exactly what he does. I had to consult other textbooks all the time in order to be able to solve the book's problems because I found the author's explanations inadequate. It's almost like the author had a minimum word count and he was struggling to meet it (""OK, just 10 more pages to go before I can release it"").

On the plus side, the problem sets are, for the most part, decently selected if you have decent reference material to help you with them (e.g. a different textbook, a good professor); if your professor's not that great and all you have is this book I pity you, the book is of some limited help in solving the problems I guess but you'll need a LOT more, especially if you're not already really familiar with this material.

I guess this book could be pretty helpful for review or reference if you already know the material, but overall it's not so great for learning the subject for the first time, especially if you're stuck using it as your primary learning source.",20

Blunden,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,Appeals to novice and expert,"I have a long experience with software development, but not much background in computation theory, just fascinating tidbits I have picked up here and there.

Being a novice, I at first was afraid that the text of the book would be beyond my understanding. It was not. For sure, the proofs are difficult and may appeal to the person with a degree in computer science. But the copious diagrams, figures and tables are wonderful supplements to the understandable text.

Lee M. Jacobs,2.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,In exact and hand wavy.,"Using this book for an intro to computation course. I can't stand the text. The first chapters on DFA's and NFA's through to PDA's are easy enough to understand; it's when you reach Turing machines that the book takes a dive. This text will provide ""proofs"" of examples. These are never strict proofs, they provide ""intuition"" but hardly an understanding. While this isn't an analysis text, the books proof for the uncountability of the real numbers is atrocious. The one example that is easier to prove and demonstrates diagnolization better would be proving that the set of binary numbers is uncountable. The text does this after the fact and only devotes a few sentences to it. Later it introduces the concept of reducibility, I am not familiar with how strict Turing and Church were when proving a language is decidable or not, but I am almost certain they put forward something more substantial than the ""programs"" that Sipser uses as proofs. If you're looking for intuition, then this book is fine. If you're looking to understand this material thoroughly I suggest something else.",8
Andrew Oliver,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to the Theory of Computation,First Thoughts: Very Mathematical; A Deep Treatment Of This Subject; Up To Date Too,"This is a book I would recommend to third year university computer science and third year university pure mathematics students. Rather terse in style densely packed with challenging content, I really will have to take time to read it carefully to fully appreciate it.

In my Bachelor of Science at the University of Melbourne years ago I studied some related content in a subject entitled 618-341 Mathematical Logic, and did not take the computer science subject 622-301 Theory Of Computation. Now, from the mathematician's point of view finitism is irrelevant it's a matter of axiom systems being consistent and proving things. The Godel number encoding of theorems and interiority arguments and clever free variable substitution arguments together with model theory were used to establish as true many powerful results ...

I note that the terminology has changed since 1982; what was called then 'a recursive formula' is now called Turing decidable and what was called then 'a recursively enumerable formula' is now called 'Turing recognizable'. For example, this author would regard a Turing machine that took a blank tape and churned out the binary representation of pi 3.14159265358979323846 etc in some tape representation to an infinite number of places as a Turing machine that loops, even if such a Turing machine was reasonably well behaved in terms of its generally moving forwards ... This begs the question of real number representation; the bit string 0.11111111111 ... is essentially the same real value as 1.0000000000 ... This suggests to me that Turing theory has taken a more finitistic turn; whether this is to avoid paradoxes recently found I haven't worked out yet. In the real world with its quantum mechanics randomness and lack of apparent finititude it's quite concievable that a multi-tape Turing machine (as described in outline in section 3.2 p176ff) device could resolve a real number function evaluation so as to avoid a value ending in an infinite series of 1's that rightly should be rounded up, and store the real value as a constant in some 'set' device for storing real numbers ... However till we know more about the real truths underlying physics this is mere speculation ...

There are a lot of topics that are quite new to me. For example, P less than NP less than PSPACE less than NPSPACE less then EXPTIME seems a rather more complex hypothesis regarding algorithms and their expected time to complete than I've met in other works ... Reading this section I hope will prove rewarding ...

Overall it seems that the field has moved on since 1982 in many a way and I hope this book enables me to refresh my knowledge with the latest results. An excellent treatment of the whole field of theory of computation.

The only criticism I can think to make is that this work seems to have a finitistic philosophy rather than a mathematical Platonist philosophy ... but then this is essential to the computer science approach rather than a pure mathematical one ...",6

My criticism of his book is more of the way it's being taught in colleges rather than the quality of the book. The book itself is packed to the brim with more material than you could probably use in two semesters of classes. My class covered only part of the book in one semester.

I think only the basics of this class should be taught on the undergraduate level: state machines, context-free languages, turing machines, and a few other things. The high-level proofs and harder material should be reserved for a graduate-level class, not for undergraduates. IMO, most CS graduates will never see hide nor hair of most of the material in this book in their entire careers, so why punish them with it?",3

Other textbooks on the subject, of which I own several, never get around to helping us learn what lambda expressions are actually telling us. Those expressions remain pure gobbledegook. I am well into reading chapter 2 of this reprinted famous 1984 edition by Henk Barendregt and the fog is already starting to clear. In many places, the author didn't write a lot of descriptive prose, but when he did, there always seemed to be a great insight in it. So be aware of that good bang for the buck.

Another thing I like about the approach here is that combinators mostly flow out of lambda calculus instead of being a fully separate subject of equal status to lambda as in the other good standard text by Hindley and Seldin, which I read into chapter 10 in fall of 2011. Lambda-Calculus and Combinators: An Introduction ((Historically, lambda calculus and combinatory logic WERE invented and developed separately, starting in the 1930s. Lambda by Alonzo Church and his illustrious students at Princeton / combinatory by Haskell Curry and colleagues, some of them during his sojourns in Holland and Gottingen.)) By the way, Haskell Curry is still noteworthy, as the Haskell functional programming language is named after him, and there is another computation method referred to as 'currying', again after his last name.

READING THIS BOOK

PART I AND READING PLANS
Finished great chapter 2 on conversion on Sun 18Aug13 / barely started chapter 3 on reduction. Chapter 3 is as well-written and clear as chapter 2 was. Finished short and great chapter 4 about theories on Tue 3Sep13. Chapter 5 on lambda models is the last one in Part I, is over 30 pages long, and is fundamentally more difficult than any of chapters 1-4, so since I don't plan to read the Part V chapters of 18-21, I am skipping chapter 5 to start Part II with chapter 6 on classic lambda calculus. I did read the survey of Part V at end of chap5 on Thu 5Sep13 afternoon, however. I hope to continue understanding this book at least thru chapter 9 of its 21 chapters.

PART II-CONVERSION
Chapter 6 on classic lambda is a gem of mainstream lambda calculus including a little bit of abstraction. Finished chap 6 on Fri 13Sep13. On Sun 15Sep13 afternoon, I well started short chapter 7 on combinators. Rather unusual, and stripped down to a tedious definition/theorem/proof bare bones approach. By section 7.2 though more clear and helpful writing returned to moderate extent. Did push thru the last 5 pages of chapter 7 on Wed 18Sep13 afternoon. Chapter 8 on more of classical lambda calculus soon, as I am a bit focussed on finishing final chapter IV of The Foundations of Mathematics (Logic). Enthusiastically got started on terrific chapter 8 on Wed 25Sep13 evening, so more later. Sections 8.1 and 8.2 were well written and quite interesting. Section 8.3 though is one of those fully Definition/Theorem/Proof (DTP) shuffles, a student-unfriendly type of writing. Difficult section 8.4, not just DTP all read, completing chapter 8 on Tue 8Oct13 evening. Chapter 9 on lambda-I calculus is completely DTP and the proofs tend to be getting longer, so my reading of this book unfortunately ended at end of chapter 8.

MISCELLANEOUS DETAILS
It really is great to be able to purchase this thorough and legendary book for a reasonable College Publications price, and I have found that CP makes rather durable paperbacks, i.e., more durable than similarly priced Dover books.

Since atypically for books on the CP roster, the Amazon page for this book is somewhat open in their 'Look Inside' utility, I shall not type in a version of the complicated table of contents as I often do in my reviews. Please check that 'look inside' for the full TOC. There are five 'Parts' of this book, each containing at least two chapters. Chapters 2-5 in part I introduce the main subjects of parts II thru V, and they each end with a small survey of the corresponding main Roman numeraled 'part' of the book.

Here is the list of the five parts: I Towards the Theory-1 (chaps 1-5) / II Conversion-129 (chaps 6-10) / III Reduction-273 (chaps 11-15) / IV Theories-409 (chaps 16-17) / V Models-467 (chaps 18-21) / Appendices-557 (A-C) / Full set of references and of indices.

THE NEW BOOK
On Thu 19Sep13 late afternoon, I received the new 2013 Lambda Calculus with Types (Perspectives in Logic) from Amazon. I am a member of the Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL), the co-publisher of this 850 page volume. Barendregt, Dekkers, and Statman are the main authors, but quite a few other experts also contributed. It combines familiar notation from the present book with some nice type tables similar to those in Benjamin Pierce's great 2002 type theory book, quite a bit of which I have read. The Amazon 'Look Inside' utility for the new book is notably open for large examination of it.",22
Nahatz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Lambda Calculus. Its Syntax and Semantics (Studies in Logic),Very good reference book.,"This book came highly recommended, and definitely lived up to that billing.
This book is a text book in many university classes on the topic at the graduate level.

This book assumes you have the ability to work with formal systems in logic
(I.E. if you were comfortable with symbolic logic you should have no trouble)
That out of the way, it is well written and covers a complex area of logic with breath and clarity.",11
College Student,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Lambda Calculus. Its Syntax and Semantics (Studies in Logic),Terse,The book is intended for those who wish to truly understand the theoretical underpinnings of lambda calculus. I think that the book is not for you if you merely want to develop the intuition for it.,7
Theodore C Pollock,5.0 out of 5 stars,Write Great Code: Volume 1: Understanding the Machine,5 Stars for Randall Hyde,"When I first started my education into computer science, and learning to program, I would get really irritated by having to spend the first few chapters of a book talking about computers and how they functioned and such. Having to spend time learning about how memory works and learning a little about binary, it all seemed pointless as I thought I already knew enough of it to begin programming and getting into the actual topic. Funny thing is that now my biggest complaint with schools these days teaching computer science is that they don't teach these things into enough detail, but this book actually does go into enough detail, to the point where you actually will learn tips and tricks to make your program run a little smoother than the other guy's program, and it teaches you the PRINCIPLES of why each part of your code will either contribute or work against you to making ""awesome code"". And what is even better is that you don't have to go through and learn assembly language in order to learn what the book is teaching because the author Randall Hyde does a perfect job of explaining it to a newbie's level.

I would suggest this book specifically to those who are just getting started into any kind of software development, or to anyone who is curious as to how computer languages actually work. More experienced programs would also benefit from what Mr. Hyde is teaching here as well, but it feels like his target audience is those who have just begun their journey into development and already have a basic understanding of an object based language such as Java or Python.",1
TurboBorland,5.0 out of 5 stars,Write Great Code: Volume 1: Understanding the Machine,How Things Work and Work Together,"There are many great free guides on how certain pieces of hardware work with your code, but there isn't a whole lot that will take a look at each piece of hardware and how it may effect each other. This book guides you through the interaction of code with individual pieces of hardware and certain modern features of this hardware.

While the book is not a programming guide (more of a research guide), it does show multi-language examples of common pitfalls programmers make and how you can correct such mistakes. This really helps the understanding of the topic when you can see and try real examples of the topic and see for yourself how it effects your code.

While most people believe this kind of material may only help in reducing code size and increasing runtime performance, it will also help you in debugging your program and understanding why your code isn't giving the results it should be. For example, understanding how exactly floating point units are handled may help with lots of headaches in the future.

The entire reason why I bought this book was to understand the interactions of code with more than just hard drive and memory. After having read the book, I must say I learned more than I expected and have already borrowed it to a friend who is interested in bettering runtime performance of their mobile applications.",1
Lance C. Hibbeler,5.0 out of 5 stars,Write Great Code: Volume 1: Understanding the Machine,Terific text,"Well, I can't say much that the other reviewers haven't already said. This is a terrific text that very clearly explains how things work in computers, right down to the finest level. Hyde writes in a casual, conversation-like tone (sometimes bordering on poor grammar) that makes this text a lot more stomachable than I would have thought. Typos are minimal (I recall maybe 4 or 5).

Now that I've been through the book (after maybe 2 weeks, at an easy pace), I can't say that I'm going to go write assembly programs. I can say that I know a great deal more about how computers work, and how I can write code that works more harmoniously with computers. My background is mechanical engineering with a ridiculous dose of electrical engineering, so a lot of the concepts presented were review for me (digital circuitry, binary math, etc)...but it is always good to hear the same material again in a different way. As I said before, the casual tone makes the material easy to follow, as well as Hyde's very clear explanations. However, as a mechanical engineer my programming background was just ""writing code,"" i.e. how to get various programs to run correctly. I read the chapter in the text on memory twice- I found that chapter alone to make the book well worth the money to me, as I am currently writing codes that demand every inch of speed and memory that the computer can offer.

So overall, its a good book, worth the money, and worth taking the time to read.",7
Barry,5.0 out of 5 stars,Write Great Code: Volume 1: Understanding the Machine,Great information... But do you really need it?,"This is a great book but I have to disagree with the overall viewpoint. I've been doing embedded programming for a while and if that's all I'd ever done I would totally agree that understanding low level concepts helps write better code. However, I also write a lot of code in C#. People who normally use high level languages such as C#, VB.Net, or JAVA are probably not going to benefit much from this book. These languages are so far abstracted from the hardware level that the concepts are hard to apply anywhere. On the other hand, if you still use malloc on a daily basis, you need to read the book :) Anyway, the book is easy to read and I never caught any errors. If you want to learn about computers at a low level, then this is a great book to start with!",44
Mike,4.0 out of 5 stars,Write Great Code: Volume 1: Understanding the Machine,The computer book you'll NEVER read..,"If you're like most IT people out in the workforce today, you've got pressures from all sides - deadlines, keeping current with changes in platforms, hardware, software tools, etc. Gah! It never ends!

So, you pick up these ""Write Great Code"" books, thinking that you'll be a better programmer.

And it's interesting in a way that you remember when you were just getting into the IT field as a student and later as an employee and maybe now as a consultant or contractor.

But, then you realize that this is like thinking about how your car's components are working while you're driving madly to work on some beltway. Only your skills as a driver can keep you from getting hit by a big semi, not the working knowledge of your V8 engine. Guys who work on their cars on the weekend, know more about them than you do, but hey, it gets you to work and back.

And so, you sigh and put the book down and concentrate on your SQL, or your VB or whatever else keeps you employed.

Why?

Because your users and your manager don't care about what goes on at the machine level. They want the deliverables NOW. The efficiency of your code is of no importance to them, though it is to you.

However, with enough discipline and some thought to what you're doing, you CAN make this book work for you, and get an edge over someone else's sloppy code and maybe even save yourself some programming time.

Because this book is for the guys who are the computer counterparts of the greasy-looking guys on the street who could tell you what's wrong with your car, even if you can't.",27

TessH,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Discrete Structures, Logic, And Computability","Required but poorly written, poorly formatted, and an unfortunate choice for teaching discrete structures","At Portland State, this book is used for beginning DS but it's a very unfortunate book to use, especially since the professor teaching it uses the same examples and notes based on the book to teach the subject in class. I actually went online and found Vladlen Koltun's lecture notes from Stanford University. He goes over the same subject matter, actually explains a good proof structure and the more basic assumptions being made, and frankly made a lot more sense. Only buy it if it's required.",8
Chris,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Discrete Structures, Logic, And Computability",Avoid if you can,"Obviously this is a required book for most so a rating does little help in deciding if you should get this or not. But at least don't pay full price for this book, rent it or buy used and get rid of it.

The examples and overall wording of the book is horrible. It is for entry level classes in this area and the reading is now where near that level. The content is hardly skimmed over and examples and exercises leave you confused on where the answers even came from. Most examples skip from problem to solution with no middle steps and variables/symbols that appear from nowhere.",1
Troy Cartmill,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Discrete Structures, Logic, And Computability",Not a great beginners book,"This book can get you more lost than a first grader walking home from school. The exercise problems are terrible. It gives you the answers to all the easy problems and the hard problems which the chapters dont explain anything well will have you frustrated and confused. The chapters give you examples, but are not clear of how to work each example out. It just gives you the solution to the problem without giving an explanation. I have yet to find a solutions manual for this book. The book is not organized very well. If you have to have this book for a class, I suggest doing all the problems in each exercise, and the ones you cant figure out ask your teacher. I'm on my last two semesters in my CS degree and I have good programming skills, I would not recommend this book.",6
Christopher Baughman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Discrete Structures, Logic, And Computability","Lots of good examples but still often obtuse. Still, better then most in this area.","If you are buying this you probably don't have a choice. Like most texts it is obtuse and can be confusing. The professor, of course, jumps around like all professors do.

On the bright side, the book has lots and lots of examples as well as even more examples through the exercises. This has been invaluable. Over all, in the grand scheme of Math proof and CS theory texts, this one is pretty decent.

Its still a text book.",1
MShojaei,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Discrete Structures, Logic, And Computability",Good source for computer science majors,"some parts are not clear enough and you certainly need additional refrences for better understanding.

lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective,"On the path to discovery of the great ideas of the future, a concept from Artificial Intelligence","The great undiscovered inventions, concepts and art of the future are there to be discovered. The path to the greatness of the future can not be planned. This book presents the case against the current path based on creating and meeting objectives, and the case for a path more likely to lead to success. A path proven to work, discovered and demonstrated in current Artificial Intelligence research.

Supported by abundant examples in the real world outside the world of artificial intelligence, this book inspires the reader to greatness by finding the interesting, the different, the new, without regard to preconceived ideas of what will eventually lead to the next great discovery. It is the novel, unexpected, the different that lead to the great undiscovered, one unpredictable step after another.

Providing Insight into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence research with unexpected applications to non-artificial intelligence. A great book for the computer scientist, non-scientist, and anyone looking for the next great thing in what ever they are interested in.",7
MandyAndJon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective,A ground-breaking search paradigm with far reaching implications,"Having been an industry AI practitioner, I’ve witnessed on more than one occasion, the unimaginative and substandard artifacts of a deceptive objective. Traditional diversity maintenance techniques such as fitness sharing and crowding often fall frustratingly short of achieving global optimization, facilitating only momentary freedom from provincial ruts, but ultimately led astray due to an unwitting reliance on objective-imposed trajectories. Similarly, manual encoding of solution space domain knowledge is a time consuming process and often infeasible for all but the smallest of search spaces; especially when we have but a fuzzy idea of the characteristics of the global optimum to begin with. Enter novelty search.

Since first happening upon Lehman and Stanley’s seminal paper on novelty search, I’ve been continuously (yet pleasantly) amazed as further experiments continue to suggest its broad, cross-domain applicability. Even so, until the publication of this book, the capability of novelty search and non-objective search in general was limited to AI sub disciplines. Yet as Lehman and Stanley so eloquently illustrate, non-objective search processes are likely the fundamental under-pinning of creative innovation. From biological evolution to space flight, the “guiding light” of the supposedly omniscient objective is suspiciously absent. What remains are stepping stones branching off in every possible direction through an infinite search space and gradually uncovering unimaginable complexities. The inter-disciplinary applications of this approach are far reaching and the profundity of the ideas presented herein cannot be understated.",4
Robert W. Brocato,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective,This is a truly great book that leaves the reader wanting more...,"This book is really revolutionary in what it attempts to tackle and in how successful it is in achieving that objective. The authors do an excellent job of supporting the concept that really great outcomes in virtually any field are usually serendipidous. You might reasonably say, ""Well, so what? If I can't plan for a great outcome, then why bother to think about it all, or at least why bother to read the book?"" This is where the book shows its really great merit. The authors have gleaned and gathered together insights into how to improve the chances of greatness. I don't want to cite examples of those principles here, because I feel that I cannot do justice to them. I simply recommend that you try reading the book, and see if you, like me, find yourself referring to the examples set forth in it on frequent occasions. This is truly an applied philosophy book, and it's insights grow more valuable as one ponders them.",1
Jon Wilson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective,"Pursue your interests, let the ambitious goals take care of themselves","My favorite part of this book was the insight that setting lofty objectives can sometimes derail progress. Letting go of longterm, ambitious goals frees us up to focus on what we enjoy, which usually produces better longterm results than the alternative. This is a philosophy I've had for a long time, so it was nice to read a book that supports it. The evidence could be stronger, but on the other hand, there probably aren't alot of experiments examining this yet. So at the very least, this book is starting an important discussion questioning the importance of ambitious goals compared to pursuing one's interests with less structure and more freedom.",1
Donald A. Tryk,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective,A very important book,"Anyone involved in science, engineering, math, software or education, or public policy relating to these, should be required to read this book. It has to do with how progress is made in science and technology. If we ignore the messages in this book, we will certainly fail to solve important, non-trivial problems.",5
Vidvuds Beldavs,3.0 out of 5 stars,Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective,"Some greatness can and must be planned. Worthwhile insights to be sure, but overgeneralized.","The book presents the case why fundamental insights and great ideas cannot be planned, however, it overgeneralizes with claims that objective setting may be valueless, even counterproductive. Clearly setting goals has been proven to be very effective. One recent report provides evidence of its effectiveness - read:http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/10/419202925/the-writing-assignment-that-changes-lives? . However, history attests to the malignancy of top level goal setting with examples such as Mao Tse Dung's Great Leap Forward that resulted in the loss of millions of lives. On the other hand, goal setting that calls forth top performance is in evidence at every Olympics or in the success of firms against great odds. Greatness in those cases is the result of planning and disciplined working of the plan. Definitely worth reading.",1

AddisonG,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning Projects for .NET Developers,Excellent hands-on F#,"I'd dabbled with F# for a while before getting this, but this is the book that really made F# click for me. At least, F# in one of its guises--the explore-it-as-we-go scripted guise. The book is well structured and written in an accessible style. Prose and code are entwined to revel how the developer is thinking as the analysis is built.

I liked it so much that I bought a physical copy after reading most of my Kindle copy. If I had to make a criticism it'd be that that the font in the physical book is tiny! That, and the use of the Titanic data-set in Chapter 6 feels, well, creepy.

If you're completely new to F# it's probably not enough to get you going--despite the claim on the back cover. But read it alongside The Book of F#: Breaking Free with Managed Functional Programming or Programming F# 3.0 and you'll be good to go.

As for the machine learning content, I'm certainly no expert. However, it seems a good introductory text to me with chapters covering the major analytical techniques that you'll find in many machine learning books, and an explanation of which you'd use with a particular data set and why.",3
David,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning Projects for .NET Developers,Great Educational Tool for All Skill Levels,"I want to start with this is a fantastic book and should be in every developer's library.

I have made it through most of this book so far and even as a professional developer focused on big data, machine learning and cloud technologies have learned a fair amount from it. I think one of the most important aspects of this book is the progression from simple to sophisticated with a focus on the simplest solution that solves the problem. I sit on the board of a community college and am an adjunct professor as well as industry guest speaker at several Universities. I recommend this book primarily for an intermediate audience, however I will be using it in my introduction to programming classes as well, as I believe with some guidance, this book will spark far more programming discussion and thought than the simpler topics.

The book is complete with functioning code and downloadable data sets; a perfect educational tool.

Thombar,5.0 out of 5 stars,GIMP for Absolute Beginners,Pretty Good,"I wish I had ""The Artist Guide to Gimp"" before I bought this one. This says it's for ""absolute beginners"" but you better know something about this type of software before you need the basics. Just didn't cut it for me. I wish books like this would have better tutorials where they start at the beginning and walk you through each step of the process with actual hands on lessons to let you see how things work. In fact I wish software manufactures would give COMPLETE instructions with their software so a customer didn't have to go out and buy book after book trying to figure out how to work it. Seems to me for a reasonable few dollars more software companies could do this. Oh and while I'm at it, Apple and Microsoft could do this with their OS's as well!",1
James F. Kadlec,2.0 out of 5 stars,GIMP for Absolute Beginners,Not for anyone with Gimp experience,"The book title says it all, unfortunately, I didn't take it at its word and bought a copy from Amazon. Since Gimp is such a dynamic program I thought I could really get something out of the text. I don't mind having a basic book because usually one can glean something in a new presentation.

However, this book has really been written about digital photo editing with Gimp or creating art with Gimp. What photo editing it has is fine, but if that is the subject and someone really wants to learn that, he or she would be better off using the freeware program Irfanview than Gimp. He or she could easily learn what is explained by trial and error. Irfanview has everything covered for editing and while Gimp can do the same things, the main purpose of Gimp is probably photo manipulation, rather than simple digital photo editing.

The complexity of what Gimp can do is far beyond what someone needs for straightforward photo editing. When working with digital photos, I do basic photo editing in Irfanview which takes only 15 or 30 seconds, then if something more is required, I go to Photoshop or Gimp or even Paint for a few things. However, beginning in Gimp or Photoshop to do simple photo editing is like using a cannon when you need a slingshot.

Even with photo editing or manipulation, this text fails. It has only black and white images. Before you buy it, consider if you want a book which tells you how to do things in color, then gives you an illustration of results in gray scale.

There is also a big section on how to create art in Gimp. Perhaps if this is your intent, this book on Gimp might have some application, however the title is then misleading.

All in all, if you have any basic knowledge of Gimp, this book is not for you. If you are looking for simple photo editing, use the intuitive program Irfanview.

It is too bad that the authors have utilized their expertise for something which I doubt has much value for people looking for basic instructions in Gimp (a niche which is still unfilled).",33

galaxy_express_899,3.0 out of 5 stars,Feynman Lectures On Computation,Dissapointing,"I find this book dissapointing. It doesn't compare with the insight, clarity, and beauty found in the famous ""Feynman lectures in physics"". Basically what Feynman does in this book is simplify and coaches one though complex Computer Science/ Information Theory Concepts. The book may have the small size of a novel, but I find it to be more like a textbook; because it has many equations (even exercises in the first chapter), and also one has to be quite attentive while reading. I'm not saying this is a bad book, only that, if you liked the ""Feynman lectures in physics"" it doesn't automatically mean you'll like this book. This book is different, obviously in the sense that it doesn't deal much with physics, and secondly in the fact that it is not passionatly written, I think. Why is this book so expensive anyways?
Now that you got my warning. I can definitely recomend this book for people intereseted in things like:
-theoretical limits of computers (enthropy, energy)
-physical realizations of logic gates (transistors)
-quantum computers",15
Guido van Rossum,2.0 out of 5 stars,Feynman Lectures On Computation,Disappointed,"I was told this would be the book where Feynman laid the foundations for quantum computing. In actuality, most of it is a rather haphazard tour of selected topics from basic computer science, using the old-fashioned bottom-up approach (starting with gates and flip-flops). There are your basic bits about Turing machines and information theory, and some weird stuff about reversible logic which supposedly leads on to the quantum computing. Then there is a reprint of an article about quantum computing which rehashes the latter bits and goes a bit farther, but unfortunately my training in quantum physics did not allow me to follow it. If you want to read good Feynman, try things like Q.E.D., which is brilliant.",5
Philip H.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R,There are some useful gems in this book,"I'm torn. There are some useful gems in this book, and for the most part, the presentation is simple, albeit a bit pedantic and cartoonish at times. If I was trying to get up to snuff on a new machine learning method, I might start here, since it *does* provide starter code for a variety of problems. That's quite handy. It doesn't, however, go into much depth at all on any one topic. You can't read this book and expect to know how to do any one of these methods well. Certainly, it's a tall order to ask any one book to cover all ML topics in depth, but any potential reader should be aware that this just skims the surface of a whole bunch of topics.

On top of this, who in the world edited this book? Every other page has horrible typos, missing words, repeated sentences. These are not trivial errors either. This is a book about data analysis and yet the reported data are clearly wrong in places, e.g., a result is listed as .06 percent in one spot and then .0006 in another (p. 271). Basic subject-verb agreement errors riddle the text, e.g. ""These output is shown as follows"". Sometimes these are trivial errors, but other times you have absolutely no idea what the intended meaning is. I have about 100 pages more to read but I'm starting to wonder if I'm just wasting my time.",28
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R,"Less tech speak, more meaty","First off, I am newbie to both machine learning and R and wanted find a starting point somewhere. I browsed around many books before deciding on this one. The writing style of Mr. Lantz is provided in a very understandable/readable manner. It's akin to someone sitting next to you and explaining things in a down to earth, layman's fashion rather than try to ""tech speak"" you to death with complicated explanations (aka formal textbook). Just the right amount of hand holding for me. I highlight quite bit and it's actually difficult with this book as there isn't much fluff. He's very succinct. The books states that it's for someone who know some ML and no R or R and no ML. I don't know either and the material is digestible except for one thing: review your stats! I took statistics long ago in college and never really learned it well the first time so I had stop and reread core concepts before continuing. Do yourself a favor and review basic statistics and probability before you start this book. I read both ""Naked Statistics"" and ""Statistics in Plain English"" and it helped me a great deal (and probably will continue to do so since it appears a bulk of machine learning is stats and prob). Currently into about a third of the way in and I am finding it to be very enjoyable and practical. Other reviewers point out that this book is too basic and this may be the case, but for someone like me who is starting from absolute scratch and who needs to understand basic ML concepts (AND basic R) I find it a great book. Will post an addendum once I complete it.",40
Dim Dandy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R,Best ML learning resource I've found,"This book is fantastic. I've been through the first four chapters, so I can't give a complete review yet, but if the rest of the book conains surprises, I will update.

Chapter 3 is on k-nearest neighbor and chapter 4 is on naive Bayes. Both provide a clear explanation of the technique, and its pros and cons, along with a simple, non-programming example. Then there is an excellent walkthrough of applying the technique to real world data, and some hints at how to improve the results by adjusting the inputs. After each chapter, I felt that I was ready to apply the technique, with the understanding that I did not yet understand everything about the topic. The chapters also are careful to explain that 1) the particular R package used has more options than have been covered and 2) there are other R packages to be investigated and experimented with.

I just couldn't be happier with these chapters, and I am fired up to keep reading and working along with the examples. It has been years since I have been reading a tech book and thinking, ""OK, just a little bit more, I don't want to quit yet"" instead of, ""Have I spent enough time and effort on this for one day yet?"" It's that good.

Although the book does provide a bit of an introduction to R, it is by no means comprehensive, and I have found that R takes time, patience and frustration to master (not that I've mastered it yet). So if I had been a complete R newbie, I probably would have struggled more.

I also found that a recent course I took in statistical inference was helpful, although not really required. At one point the book describes normalizing features using Z scores. I knew what Z scores were, so that was a point I didn't need to simply take on faith.

If you are relatively new to R and machine learning, and you want to learn to do machine learning with R, this *is* the book.

UPDATE: I am working through chapter 10, on validating model performance, and it is a goldmine. Maybe it's a matter of my general knowledge about machine learning concepts coalescing at the same time I'm reading this chapter, but it was like a long line of lightbulbs were getting switched on in my head.

UPDATE 2: I've now read the entire book and chapter 11, on improving model performance, was invaluable. It introduces random forests, and somehow finds a way to make the concept easy to comprehend, where every other article I've read or video I've watched made it seem very complicated. This chapter has given me the confidence to start tackling more sophisticated kaggle competitions using ensemble methods. Really looking forward to it.",4

Life long learner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R,Excellent book,"This is a great book. I liked the way authors highlight syntax for models and discuss strengths and weeknesses. It has a nice balance of theory and hands-on training. However, I would need to use a R book, such as R in action, in conjunction with it.

I have looked at many books on the topic. I will put my review for all of these. Perhaps this can save you some time.
1) http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470650931 : Good theoretical book, but badly written and does not have any hands on exercise.
2) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1466503963 : This is another great book. Good balance of theory and hands-on exercise. This is an excellent book to start learning data mining and R. However, this book relies on a GUI RCommander. It does a good job and one can do a lot with it but it has its limitations. However, I will still use this book.
3) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439810184 : This is an advanced book and heavily entrinched in cases. This makes it difficult to replicate things unless your work is directly related to one of the case studies covered.
4) http://www.amazon.com/dp/0133412938 : Good examples, but does not explain much about the interpretation. This leaves one wondering what is the purpose of certain graph, what are the axis and how to interpret it. if appropriate explanation is added, this would be an excellent book.
5) http://www.amazon.com/dp/111844714X : This book is very expensive and almost totally devoid of any theory or discussion. I would not use it.
6) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1441998896: This is a decent book. It relies on another GUI, Rattle. It is a strong contender to the book 2 in this list.",28

If you're not a High School student and you know basic statistics and basic college level math, this book will not be much use to you.

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Introducing Data Science: Big Data, Machine Learning, and more, using Python tools",Can this book be trusted?,"I've only read through page 50, but I have already found several errors. A particularly egregious one occurs in the first code listing, in which a regression model is fit through the origin even though an intercept should clearly be present. The data for the regression model is created as follows: two predictors, let's say x1 and x2, are created from the uniform(0, 1) distribution. The response = 0.4 x1 + 0.6 x2 + error, where the error term is also distributed as uniform(0, 1). That being the case, the intercept should be close to 0.5, the mean of the uniform(0, 1) distribution. You may wonder what difference that makes. Well... if the correct model is used, the model coefficients end up being close to the actual coefficients used to create the data, namely 0.4 and 0.6, instead of 0.7658 and 1.1252 as shown in the text. In addition, R-squared for the correct model is about 0.3, a far cry from the ""high"" value of 0.893 reported by the authors.",12
~Cathy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Guide to Firewalls and VPNs,"Text 4, Questions 2","This is the third? fourth? textbook I've used out of the Cengage series. I have Principles of Information Security and Security+ Guide to Network Security Fundamentals sitting on my shelf across the room, and I think there's another book in the same series sitting around here somewhere. The books look similar and have very similar content. There's a little more of this in this one and a little more of that in that one, but the content isn't radically different. If you've mastered one book, you probably can do pretty well on tests taken out of the others. In fact, on a couple questions where I couldn't recall a factoid and couldn't find it in this book, I found it in one of my old textbooks. If this is the first of these similar texts you use, you'll learn a lot: if it's not, you'll get a lot of review. (To be fair, I'm rock-solid on what's covered!)

Unfortunately, the exercises at the ends of the chapters are a hot mess. It wasn't always clear to me what the review questions were getting at, and when the specific answers they're looking for aren't stated clearly, it's all a big guessing game and not a fun one.

It was the same with some of the real world exercises and hands-on projects.

By far the worst problem, however, is the fact that this book is so far out of date. Project 4-1 tells you that you need a computer running Windows XP or Vista. Project 5-1 needs Vista or XP SP3 *headdesk* Many of the exercises couldn't be completed on my Windows 8 computer. I tried to approximate them as best I could, but whatever I was supposed to find often wasn't where it had been in earlier versions of Windows, and what I got looked drastically different from what the book said. The running case project calls for VirtualBox 3.2.6 for Windows hosts. The current version appears to be 4.3.2 and 3.2.6 isn't available even in legacy builds (although older, unsupported versions are available.) No worries about that because the book also calls for Vyatta VC6.0 - Virtualization ISO for the Vyatta software firewall application that you're supposed to run in VirtualBox. The website given redirects to that of the company that seems to have absorbed or bought out Vyatta. I wasn't able to locate the software firewall. This running case project continues through the book, leaving the student unable to complete a lot of the hands-on exercises that would have given practical skills that weren't covered in the text or in the other books I've used. A pity, because I would have liked to get the experience.",4

Instead, it actually goes into the mathematical derivations and underlying principles of the algorithms (!) and instructs the user on how to build systems from the ground up. I'll likely be using this a lot in the near and distant future as a reference when I have to implement these systems in other languages. The reason I'm not giving it four stars is that I felt it was a little on the thin-side at times.

The authors get directly to the point and put the most important definitions and concepts in a very clearly way. I have successfully applied this book to my undergrad students (some mathematical background are needed, but with correct directions most of them could get the grip). To graduate students this booklet is not sufficient, this attains only to the essentials, there are a lot of more extensive books on the market, and this book could be a good complement to these books. Negative points: I missed some exercises to help the reader to get the concepts fixed; the only exercises that are present go along with the text on ""to-check"" questions proposed to the reader. Some of they are important and could be at the end of each chapter. Also, the book page: [...] still needs more work and increase of contents.

Not because it is a hands on 'how to' book, which it is not. But because it discusses from a high level perspective, all of the diverse technologies that have to be used together, and fully integrated, within a cognitive computing platform. Throughout the book, real world use cases are discussed, as they relate to a specific component within such an environment. What I would like to see in a future revision, is a discussion of Prolog in the chapter on knowledge representation, as it is an International Standards Organization (ISO) AI programming language used throughout the world. In addition, the book has a slight bias, to cognitive computing a la big blue, as there is a chapter devoted to their product offering.

Nikita,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cognitive Computing and Big Data Analytics,Watery water,"There is no ""how"" in this book, there is no detailed guidance, there is no guidance at all. First I thought that it might get 3 stars just for being an encyclopedia for dummies with no interrelation between entities. No, it's not even that.

Here is one phrase you pay for buying this book, it's located on page 71: ""[cognitive computing] is analogous to the way a child learns about the world through observation, experience, and perhaps instruction"". There is nothing before that phrase in the book, nothing (new) after. There is no ""how"" besides a lot of hand weaving, speculations, stating obvious facts (sometimes), and a LOT of water in between. A lot. Just plain water, no information at all.

Maybe not surprisingly, the authors wrote more than 5 books together in the ""For Dummies"" series. I would argue that even book for a ""dummy"" have to have some knowledge synthesis, some information, and most of them do.

Jeremy Kun,2.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Action,"Little on Theory, Too Much on UI","I agree with other reviewers' complaints on the repetitiveness and poor flow of this book, but I want to point out some other concerns and appreciations.

In the preface Harrington emphasizes the importance of knowing the theory and being able to connect the theory to the algorithms and applications. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, but it appears Harrington forgot this was his stated goal. The mathematics contained in the book is wishy-washy and vague, and its connections to the algorithms is at best tenuous. Harrington rarely explains why a particular formula is used, and when he does he's really explaining how it's used and not why it makes sense to use it (given, this is a common criticism of applied mathematics). He will often throw in mathematical jargon without a useable explanation. And for every paragraph spent on mathematical theory, five paragraphs are spent on how to use various third-party libraries for graphing, UI, and data collection (e.g., Tkinter, Matplotlib, Yahoo! PlaceFinder API, Google Shopping API, etc.). These are great, but they massively clutter the text. I'd much rather have a 200 page appendix than have circuitous detours sprinkled throughout the book.

One big plus is in his treatment of support vector machines. He includes (unlike many texts which are solely about support vector machines) a complete python implementation of the Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm. That being said, it's a horrendous piece of code clearly not written for legibility. This page (page 109) is littered with at least fifteen 1-3 letter variable names and pointless statements like ""if L==H: print 'L==H'; continue"". Harrington is apparently afraid of using whitespace, and as the function goes on it becomes increasingly cramped and impossible to read (mostly due to the pervasive use of backslashes to denote line continuations). Instead of breaking the code into functions and explaining the pieces, Harrington uses a comment-style typeset code annotation. In my opinion this only helps to clutter the page. It's clear this piece of code (as with his other code samples) were heavily constrained by the page width. It's the author and editor's job to compensate for that; they failed.

So while this book has a lot of valuable resources in it, they should fix it in two ways. First, quit pretending this is a useful mathematical treatment. Second, reorganize.

I will say at least, that with these minor modifications, this text is *vastly* better than Marsland's attempt, ""Machine Learning, an Algorithmic Perspective.""",65
Arun R,3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Action,Good attempt but needs LOT of improvement,"Looking at many good reviews on amazon, I decided to purchase this book. It's a decent book, but IMO it has been edited poorly and the code has not been tested properly.

The introduction chapter got me really excited, just like other Manning's ""in Action"" books do. But once I started executing the code in chapter 2 ""Classifying with k-nearest neighbors"" I realized that the code had bugs. Though I could figure out what's wrong and fix the bugs, I did not expect this from Manning, after having read some of their excellent books like (The Quick Python Book, Second Edition,Spring in Action and Hadoop in Action).

Moreover the book has some introduction to python and numpy in appendix A. I believe the author could have pointed the reader elsewhere for learning python and those pages could have been used to explain more of numpy and matplotlib, which the author uses freely without any explanation in the text. (Yup, be ready to read some online numpy and matplotlib tutorials and documentation.)

If you don't know python, then you can do what I did: read The Quick Python Book, Second Edition and then attempt this book.

The figures in the book are not in color so you need to execute the code to understand what the author is telling. It forces you to actually run the code, which is good, but you can't read this book without a computer in front of you.

Finally, I am a big believer in following the conventions of a language. I would have been really happy had the author followed PEP8 ([...]), because along with learning machine learning, you could have learnt some good python coding practices.",32

enty,4.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Action,Good Overview of Machine Learning,"This book is a good introduction to the main algorithms used in machine learning: linear/logistics regression, kNN, decision and regression trees, naive Bayes, support vector machines, AdaBoost, SVD, and PCA. The author does a good job as presenting complex concepts in a simple fashion.
However, many chapters feel more like simplistic summaries around Python code and the editing can be poor at times repeating the same information between a main paragraph and a shaded summary on the next page. I would still recommend this book as a fairly broad overview of these techniques and a valuable starting point for implementing them. It is easy to read and offers a good selection of algorithms.
If you are looking for a more formal alternative, I can only recommend the book from Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman: The Elements of Statistical Learning. That book presents a more rigorous approach to the same algorithms, their goals, limitations and main variants. It is presented as a reference book but does not drown the reader in an sea of formulas, unlike similar reference books.",2

Sujit Pal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Action,"A ""Just Do It"" Machine Learning Book","I am new to Machine Learning and I found the book a very good hands-on introduction on the subject. The author takes 8 of the Top 10 algorithms in Machine Learning (based on a 2007 survey paper) and implements them in Python. Other reviewers have pointed out that the theoretical explanations and code quality were somewhat lacking, and thats true. However, even though Python is an extremely readable language, machine learning algorithms are (generally) hard, and I found that it helped to understand them better if I typed them out myself, copying/copy-pasting and restructuring the code as I went, and experimenting with the contents of the intermediate data structures in the REPL. Also, once you have a general idea of how it works, it becomes easier to parse the math in the paper on which the algorithm is based.

I still don't completely understand all the implementations, but the book did give me some intuition about how to choose the right algorithm for a given problem. I believe that is also important since ML practitioners often use third party algorithms rather than code everything up from scratch. Of course, for the times you do need to code it up from scratch, you can get some valuable insights about machine learning algorithm design from the style adopted in the book - start small, visualize in 2D/3D for insights, then generalize to higher dimensions. The examples cover a wide range, from dating sites to semiconductor plants, so you get a feel for all the different places these algorithms can be applied.

In short, if you want to ""Just do ML"", ie, quickly get started and pick up anything else you need along the way, then this book may be for you.",5
Ken L,4.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Action,Great book for getting into machine learning,"This is a very good way to quickly and easily explore machine learning techniques. The code snippets are generally well explained, and short enough to be digestible. Being able to play around with the data and algorithms in an interactive way really helps the concepts sink in. I'm actually reading the book on my Kindle (the printed version includes a code to download an electronic version), and on my Kindle the book includes color figures and useful hyperlinks. As other reviewers have pointed out, some of the code examples have errors, which is frustrating. The book's website has an errors and corrections forum topic, but it's a pain to have to go there when the code does not work. However, the good (and there is much goodness) greatly outweighs the bad. If you like a hands-on approach to learning ML techniques (and don't mind chasing a few bugs) then you will love this book.",6

Andy55555,1.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Action,"Great idea, terrible execution","Using Python and NumPy code to teach machine learning is a great idea. Well-written Python is so easy to understand that it's often called 'executable pseudocode', and third-party extensions such as NumPy and SciPy make it competitive with platforms like Matlab for math and science application programming. The author seems to know his subject, and he had another good idea when deciding to structure the book around the ten most popular machine learning algorithms (though he only ends up covering eight of them for reasons he explains in the introduction). Unfortunately, the book is poorly written and even more poorly edited; it reads like a very rough draft that was put once through a spell-checker and then published. The text is repetitive, confused, and often doesn't match up with the code and data sets to which it refers. Color-coded figures are published (in the print edition) in black and white.

Phred,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Computer and the Brain (The Silliman Memorial Lectures Series),Something of a historical curiosity,"Perhaps more so than Alan Turing, (If we accept the intro by Kirtzweil, a man with serious credentials), John von Neuman was one of the most important figures in developing the basic architecture of the modern digital computer. The two did work together, but von Neuman was the senior and I propose had a better grasp of the juncture of math and machine.
The Computer and the Brain is the last published work by von Neuman and was an attempt to bring together what was known about the machine qualities of the brain and what the machines of 1957 might one day be able to accomplish.
As such almost everything is dated and new discoveries in neuroscience more so than in computers place limits on the absolute value of his comments.

That said, there was a head line in recent science news that there is a prototype computer in testing that combines both digital and large scale parallel computing in the manner von Neuman suggests as the model for how the brain may work.

The Computer and the Brain is the printed from of a lecture. He was too ill (mortally) for the series he was offered to conduct. So great was the respect for the man that he was allowed to present only these papers, sufficient for one lecture and about 3 hours reading. I do not think he read the paper; he had just the strength to write it.

Besides having been a vitally important mathematician, he was active in the cause of scientific ethics and as the man who drafted the letter, signed by Einstein credited with America committing to atomic research he is therefore a originator of the atomic age. He was a man of great thought and influence.
Reading this book is a chance to listen to a great mind. I make no claim to have understood all of it. I suspect that no one should read it in an effort to be at the leading edge of math, computers or neurology. It is a hard, but worth it read, and a glass into our recent history.",4

Early in my graduate career I began working with neural networks and discovered this book in a electronic bookshelf available at my university. After printing chapter after chapter to read on subway rides home I ended up buying it for convenience. It gave me the background I needed to code up a basic artificial neural network in C++ and to then extend it to fit my needs.

The style of the writing is the perfect balance of enough detail to understand a concept or method without unnecessary wordiness. Each chapter covers an important aspect of neural network development and application - for exmaple, internode weight initilaization techniques - and acts a sort of mini-review of the most popular methods with a clear explanation of the pros and cons of each.

This is an excellent bookshelf addition for anyone who works with neural networks.",5
Abdul,5.0 out of 5 stars,Build Your Own Underwater Robot and Other Wet Projects,Excellent introduction to homebuilt ROVs.,"I came across this little gem of a book while searching on the Internet for ideas, inspiration and technical advice on building a basic ROV for my then 7 year old son. His interest stems from knowing I am employed in the industry as an ROV pilot.

Build Your Own Underwater Robot and Other Wet Projects provides both an excellent introduction to beginners and a great easy understanding of the basic design principles and considerations to individuals already working in the industry. Two complete ROV designs are presented - the introductory level 3-thruster SeaPerch and a slightly more ambitious 6-thruster SeaFox. There is even advice on how to select and fit a camera to receive live video feed. Each of the designs can be taken on their own or used as inspiration together with the other material presented to evolve your own design. I have personally chosen to make a bigger, beefier SeaPerch version while incorporating some of the features of the SeaFox such as the camera and compass.

The book is lively and fun to study. Plenty of diagrams and an easy-to-read language all add to it's appeal. As another reviewer mentioned, the accessible style makes it suitable even for younger children. I cannot think of any other book equally suitable for 7 year olds through to pensioners! And all at a very affordable price too. There really are no negatives about it.

For those aspiring to delve deeper into technical details I would also recommend checking out Underwater Robotics: Science, Design & Fabrication. Another fantastic one-of-a-kind ROV book delivering more of the same but on a much grander scale.",1

The projects are not very complicated but a good start in building water proof machinery. You can always develop on and make something awesome out of the current simple projects.
In my case I have started a project called Project Seahorse(search for project-seahorse at [...]) at our robotics club here at Oslo.

RHV,2.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Python: Essential Techniques for Predictive Analysis,Code implemented is poor. Explanation of algorithms is good.,"I have no idea why the author didn't implement pandas or numpy instead of devoting pages to reading csv files with base python. He chose to store data in lists of lists. Why??? He chose to normalize and store data ""the ol' fashioned way"" instead of using numpy arrays. This makes the code less readable. (Seriously, every example begins with several lines of code simply to read the data, loop through each line, split on a "","", append to a list, etc. Using pandas' read_csv or numpy's genfromtxt code have accomplished the same thing in one line!)

The author does say, however, that he included a lot of code to help explain how the algorithms work. This is actually helpful--when it relates specifically to a machine learning algorithm. He subsequently makes use of scikit-learn objects in the examples, as he should.Why he didn't follow the same approach when reading CSV files, I have no idea.

My recommendation is as follows. If you're looking for code to implement, I would not use this book for proper examples. If you're looking for an explanation of penalized regression and ensemble algorithms, this book is pretty good for that purpose in my opinion.",27

On the other hand, the book is very basic – little you can't get from the scikit-learn documentation – and some of the recommendations are bizarre (weird chartjunk instead of scatterplot grids and pairwise correlation matrices to study predictors), borderline wrong (QQ-plots to study outliers, seriously?) or incomplete (no clear distinction is made between variable importance scores and regression parameters).",6

The authors thoroughly search-out all perspectives in this new field (i.e. it has a huge bibliography) and treat each perspective with skillful fairness. It both establishes itself as the authoritative reference, framing the issues for the new field of machine ethics, and establishes the credibility of the field as an academic pursuit. Good libraries ought to have this book.

This book was not intended as an introduction to ethics, but it is the book I would be inclined to assign as an ethics textbook. It covers an introduction to ethics, of course, but also covers material in related disciplines (psychology, economics, etc.), and gets technical about where our society assumes ethical faculties. It forces the reader to think about how ethics work, rather than just express opinions about contemporary moral issues, and is probably the very best book in existence for giving readers an appreciation for the ways the field of ethics will have to grow in the near future.",1

In animals evolution has hardwired in a set of heuristics (drives, aversions, etc.) which perform this decomposition (i.e. pain, pleasure, sex drive, hunger, thirst, discomfort, innate fears, sickness, loneliness, curiosity, etc.) Note that all of these produce a much more immediate reward (feedback) than U, N, or L can. It is, however, possible to give artificial intelligences a BETTER value system than this.

sandiego,2.0 out of 5 stars,Computer Vision: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition),Difficult read,"This book is the required textbook for a class. I ordered the 2nd edition after reading the poor reviews dating back to well before the second edition had been published. It was my hope that perhaps a major rewrite had occurred after that author absorbed the poor reviews. Sadly, that does not appear to be the case. I am just starting the class and have much of the book left to read, but the frustration felt by past reviewers is now clearly understood by me.

In general, the book tends to run both hot and cold. Clearly the authors are deeply knowledgeable about the subject. And there are many good sections of the book that do reasonable job of explaining the concepts. It is the sections that dive into the math where the authors tend to undermine their own hard work and that, I believe, are source of a number of the book's poor reviews.

One of the topics of the book is the classification (of images), so in keeping with this let me attempt to classify this book. This book seems to fall into the category of a book written by really smart people that loses more than it has to when read by a not-so-smart person. Said differently, this is probably a great book for those that already know the subject and the math. That is, the book can be quite readable for a few paragraphs and give the reader some intuition for the topic. However, when the book dives into the math for a few paragraphs and then emerges on the far shore, it has probably abandoned most readers. Certainly, more often than not it has abandoned me and, from the reviews, I believe that I am not the only one. I suspect the authors have majors in math, but perhaps they have been swimming in the math for so long that it has become comfortable. Whatever the reason, the authors do a poor job in setting up the math, are too dependent on concise math notation (again which would be well know to a math major but not necessarily by others) and as the math discussion progresses the authors make among the largest leaps mathematically among any textbook that I can recall. Additionally, the sections that discuss the math seem to be of varying quality. Often I would get the sense that what made it to final print were a set of notes or a rough draft that had not yet been completed let alone edited.

Regarding the poor setup and excessive brevity in a passage I just read, the authors describe an equation as having three terms, then they give the equation and never state which term is which. As the math unfolds, the reader is stuck because, although he can read the transformations relating to (for example) the rho term he does not know which term is represented by rho. The author also at points use what I find to be a somewhat odd notation (e.g., for linear algebra). In general a few examples would go a long way as well. The authors attempts at homogeneous coordinates and scale rotate and translate was awful and awfully short. A book that I have on motion in robotics spends perhaps 5 times as many pages to discuss a similar topic, with more examples and less dense notation, with the upshot being that the reader of the robotics book walks away having learned the concept and the Computer Vision reader walks away confused and having learned little (again, a math major might have been able to track better with the CV book and gotten a little more).

Were the authors to read this critique, they might counter that they were trying limit the math and instead to provide narratives that provide for an intuitive understanding of the subject. This would be a fair point and a worthy goal. When writing a book, the author must decide who his intended audience is; e.g., an undergraduate engineering student, a graduate student, academic colleagues, etc. However, if this was their intent then the approach the authors took was not unlike trying to meet a page count by removing every third word from the draft text.

In short, of what I have read so far, this book can only be followed without great struggle by those already familiar with the subject and the math. It has lots of potential, so I hope that the authors take the criticism in the constructive spirit in which it is offered with the result being a still better third edition.",7

Coder,4.0 out of 5 stars,Linux+ Guide to Linux Certification (Test Preparation),"Very good overall, NO coverage of X configuration?","First, I have to say that I am not usually fond of computer books in the Thompson Course Technology series -- too many of them are NOT really written by knowledgeable people, and it shows in the errors and misguided opinions passed on to students and professors charged using these books.

So, I was pleasantly surprised at the content (of a Linux book in particular) by Thompson. Most of the information is relevant, useful, and introduces students to important skills and management practices when using Linux in a business environment.

I do have some issues with the orders of the chapters -- for example, file and folder permissions vs. users and groups chapters should be back-to-back, and there are a couple errors in laboratory exercises. For example, a couple of the exercises, done in order, are intended to demonstrate the effect of one user assuming another's UID. But the point to be demonstrated doesn't actually happen. New Linux users won't realize there was an error in the thought process of the text, and will think they ""just missed the point"" due to their own imagined ineptness. There are a few typos but they are minor -- if teachers (and even casual users Linux users) don't catch them outright, shame on them, they are so simple.

I actually have a *couple* of not-so-minor gripes, and struggled with whether to give the book 3 or 4 stars, but then it is so much better than other Linux books in some areas that I couldn't give it a 3.

My first big gripe is that the chapter on so-called ""X Configuration"" is *NOT* about *configuring* *X*! It is actually about *customizing* the *desktop*, using the desktop utilities, for personal use/preferences (the way you change your desktop properties in Windows). The topic of *X CONFIGURATION* -- one of the first tasks most new Linux users must learn, usually necessary since Linux is not OEM (preinstalled) on most computers -- is actually NOT COVERED AT ALL!

Along the same lines, the *obvious* flow of post-install activities in the book should include taking a Linux distro that boots non-GUI by default, an introduction to the format of an X configuration file, how to research your computer hardware, and how to edit the default X configuration file for all users per hardware requirements and to start the login manager and desktop of choice.

Even in network environments, this is a common task because X can be run as a network application, or for other reasons. Unlike Windows, the OS is more modular; the underlying kernel, the ""window server"" (X) and the ""desktop"" (GUI look-and-feel and utilities) are 3 very seperate things and allow freedom of choice.

My second gripe is there is no coverage of package installation! Very, very bad! How can you be certified in Linux without learning to install software on it? One or two chapters need to be added here, covering RPM and TGZ installs at a minimum. Users need background on what is done when software is installed on Linux, the most common ways in which software install locations and config tend to differ among distros, and the most popular package managers out there (brief contrast of strengths and weaknesses).

Ideally, students would actually perform both RPM and TGZ installs, would uninstall them afterwards, would use one or more command-line tools to update a package or two, would use a popular package manager to install a new package and look for updates, and would download source code manually and compile at least one package from scratch, just to get a feel for it. An example is OpenOffice.org, because it is easy to install (few steps needed), and new OO versions tend to change folder names and locataions, (students must deal with this and uninstall the old version and delete remnant folders to avoid confusion before installing the new, then edit desktop shortcuts to point to new executable in new location).

My third gripe is the use of an outdated OS, and one with such a poor installer. I think the author was thinking that Red Hat is popular with commercial enterprises (certainly) and so it would be a good choice. But Fedora Core 3??? C'mon, that's the stone age (at least in PC years)! Plus, this OS boots to a GUI (not a good for newbies to Linux sysadmin who need to learn to manually configure X). Most books will make a better choice of distro or at least customize their own ""release"" of the distro to match the purpose of the book.

Also, the menu-based installer on Fedora Core 3 is really crap. Though I am a seasoned Linux user who habitually changes partition schemes and multi-boot environments, the menu logic and layout/alignment of selections was so poor that I became confused and had to backtrack/start over several times during my install.

However, complaints aside, this is generally an excellent book. It gives some excellent lessons and examples on using the ""vi"" editor and using various text-manipulation, file-manipulation, and search tools. The vast majority of non-newbies in this book's audience will learn new tricks for example, grep, dmesg, cat, top. The chapter on boot loaders is excellent, contrasting the functionality of LILO and GRUB, and the optional parameters which can be used in their config files. While this book assumes no Linux knowledge at all on the part of the user, it is in some ways almost a ""power users"" cookbook. I learned much from this book and use it as a reference.

Some of this book's major strengths are the clarity of the writing, the usefulness of the lessons, and the extensive number of exercises which can be used both in a college course and on your own.

I strongly feel this text is overdue for a revision -- below are some recommendations summing the above points and adding some things that need less explanation:

1) X CONFIGURATION NEEDS A CHAPTER, and soon after install and intro to the file system. (Desktop customization should just be deleted because it's not an administration topic and anyone who's used any OS before can figure it out all by themselves.)

2)PACKAGE INSTALLATION, COMPILATION, AND UPDATING NEEDS A CHAPTER OR TWO.

3) CHAPTERS ON USERS/GROUPS AND FILE/FOLDER PERMISSIONS NEED TO BE CONSECUTIVE. (Chapter 11 is too late to be giving this info.)

4) THE BOOK NEEDS TO USE AN RPM/TGZ-COMPATIBLE DISTRO WITH A DECENT INSTALLER AND MORE APPROPRIATE CONFIG -- either switch distros or customize it for the book, and definitely use something newer. (Why not switch to kernel 2.6 while they're at it?)

5) IDEALLY, THE BOOK AND THE DISTRO WOULD INCLUDE TWO DESKTOPS. At least introduce students to two, even if the majority of the book will use one in particular. I don't even necessarily mean KDE vs. GNOME, could be one of those vs. a much more stripped-down desktop to really contrast. Assuming the text already taught basic X config, including login manager and desktop loading, now teach them the main benefit -- users can tweak their own config, and the first way to do so is choose a desktop other than the default for all users. Which brings us to #6...

6) GIVE A USEFUL EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE ""SKELETON DIRECTORY"" IS USED FOR, NOT JUST A VAGUE EXPLANATION. Have an exercise where users place a couple default folders and organizational document in here and a copy of the X config, create a new user, log in as that user and view the doc, customize X to start a different desktop, copy the edited config to the correct location, reboot, log in as that new user again -- tada! Skeleton directories are even useful on a home system, but they are mostly used in organizations with many users.",20

JohnDiego,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Common Lisp (Expert's Voice in Programming Languages),"Awesome, detailed, and elightening introduction to Common Lisp","There are many glowing reviews for the hardback edition, and my paperback copy is identical to it. Refer there for more reviews. Practical Common Lisp

This is a great introduction to Common Lisp. Thankfully it doesn't get to the stuff I learned in my Lisp manual 40 years ago, CAR, CDR and similarly arcane functions until 1/4 of the way in to the book. Much of the insight in to the unique power of Lisp was lost in the orignal books while mucking around in list structures.

The light bulb starts to click on what a powerful language Common Lisp is in Chapter 5 about functions, and clicks on brighter in Chapter 7 on macros (despite my deep-seated reservations about macros as a long-time professional c/c++ programmer), and many chapters after that illuminate the power, flexibility, expressiveness and conciseness.

I have one small complaint. In my paper copy (yes I am a bit old skul and do better reading from ink on dead trees, but at least in my case the book will do an outstanding job of carbon sequestration since I don't burn books, nor do most others), the print is slighly faint and fuzzy, and varies some from page to page. I was reading without my glasses one night and saw the reason. The font is slightly fuzzy with dots on narrow parts of letters and alternating dark/light areas on thicker parts. This likely saves a fair amount of ink in printing, but it detracts from the appearance and readability of a very fine book.

One surprising thing missing from the book is any discussion of the art of debugging lisp. There is a discussion of handling error conditions and exceptions, but that is not debugging. There are some good links online (search Google for Common Lisp debugging), but given how different debugging Lisp is compared to other languages, where most readers will come from, a chapter on that would have put the final icing on an outstanding book.",2

I have read this entire book (some parts more than once). I have completed modestly large freelance projects using php, actionscript, python and c. I do not have a formal background in computer science (I have a degree in Art). I learn by practice and by reading books.

Thinking of this book, here's what comes to mind, -one of the most enjoyable learning experiences I have had. It communicates itself with effectiveness, originality and a careful attention to detail.

When I first began using this book, I was skeptical of it. Chapter 3 introduces Common Lisp with a 'Practical', a step-by-step build-up of a small Lisp program. The next few chapters explain syntax, functions, variables and macros.

I was skeptical because, at the time, I understood little of Chapter 3 and it seemed to me that the following chapters (syntax, functions, variables, etc.) should have preceded Chapter 3. There are no end-of-chapter directives and only the 'Practical' chapters include significant tasks for cementing concepts. What does it mean?

It becomes evident that this organization is a good thing. It forces the reader to engage the book with a fresh approach. After reading a few chapters following Chapter 3, a necessary re-read of Chapter 3 yields great understanding. It sets the reader into a rhythm of reading... reading some parts once for creative enjoyment and once again for critical comprehension.

This is an important aspect of this book and my appreciation of it. The author does not try to anticipate and satisfy the expectations of the reader (a linear presentation of mixed code/explanation). Instead, like an artist, the author presents his method and changes the reader's perspectives to match his own.

The organization also adds something to the long-term usability of the book. Mini-programs and behavior test-cases are mostly reserved for the 'Practical' chapters. The other chapters are not cluttered with these things and are devoted to single topics. 'For example there is a chapter devoted to numbers. Another chapter is about the 'format' function, Common Lisp's equivalent of printf. The material in these chapters is patiently and thoroughly presented.

This is one of my favorite books. After reading it I was able to write a Common Lisp program that uses classes, packages and macros.",1
Philip H. Smyth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Common Lisp (Expert's Voice in Programming Languages),"""Practical"" is the key.","There have been any number of excellent books written on Lisp and its sister, Scheme. ""The Little Lisper"" and ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"" are two that come to mind. What most of them have in common is an emphasis on applying the powerful semantic features of Lisp to fundamental questions in computer science.

This book does show that side of Lisp. However, its most important feature is in showing an underexposed side of common Lisp - that of a potent and underutilized tool for real world programming applications.

File operations, XML and HTML output and web services are all covered. Constructs like the loop macro and package system are given extensive treatment. These were essential tools in the days when Lisp Machines roamed the earth. The unique power of the ""defmacro"" user defined macro facility is shown to good advantage.

I am giving the author five stars for a comprehensive *practical* treatment. This book demonstrates that Lisp is as capable as the current breed of ""dynamic"" languages for application programming - while possessing unique functional powers that have yet to be equaled.",12
J. Sacher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Common Lisp (Expert's Voice in Programming Languages),"Incredible book for an experiences programmer, but LISP newbie","I graduate college with an Electrical Engineering Degree, but took many Computer Science classes. I went into software, instead of hardware, as a career choice. I have used Perl, Java, C, VB 3-6, C# and other languages in my day to day job over 8 years. My only experience with LISP is hearing about it, while in college, and possibly the use of EMACS when doing Unix systems programming in C. While trying to locate good beginning courses for a co-worker, I came across MIT's online 6.001 class, using LISP. This rekindled my interest in learning LISP. The book for this course really didn't answer the ""why should I learn LISP?"" question. This book does.

After intending to purchase the textbook for that course here at Amazon and actually ordering it, I found this book. I wound up ordering this book and canceling the other (since it was online). If you are very low on funds, you can also find the text of this book online. I prefer a hard copy of the book for easier reference.

nunb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Common Lisp (Expert's Voice in Programming Languages),Rebutting a 2-star review...,"Want to 'get' Lisp? You're in the right place, just click on Buy.

This is a great introduction to a deep topic, starting with the first few chapters.

Once you've absorbed this book, I will admit it's a bit hard to go back to for reference. Seibel's style is insidious, he lets Lisp seep into you. You cannot point to a line and say, ha! that's where I learned macros, because macros are now a part of you. I think it's an excellent (nonpareil, even) pedagogical style. YMMV, but I'm all for Sidious Seibel's approach.

If you want a reference, blow your socks off with lispdoc-dot-com -- check it out now (be sure not to be drinking coffee before you go there!).

--- Historical ---

This book had a 2-star review. I created a 1-star review to address the specific criticisms made by that person. The old text pertaining to that is below.

... with a 1-star review! What better way?

I cannot imagine how the reviewer came up with 2 stars. Maybe: ""This book is #1 (hence *cough* 1-star)"" ?

Shoddy writing? Please! This book made me giggle in glee in parts...

Lisp in a Box seems to be the reviewer's only objection. It's easy to find and install, a more worthwhile endeavor than getting mad and swearing to find every single last reference to LispBox in subsequent chapters.

The 'Learn CL in 21 days' reference the reviewer makes is telling, they clearly expect a brief howto-learn-this-language-in-7 hours, judging by their admission that learning how the if statement works is the crux of learning a language.

Certainly this book is better read and digested before opening a lisp environment. And that is definitely the way to learn a new deep topic imho. Understand something in depth, then write small programs to test your understanding of it. Frittering away your time between writing one-liners and reading a book is just that, you won't gain any understanding. It may work for Perl, but ;-)

Lisp is a language to blow your mind. Expecting a quick howto is naive at best, and a sad troll attempt at worst. Read the music database chapter slowly and carefully. If you're attentive, you /will/ be hit with a wonderful epiphany of how Lisp is 'powerful'. Really. Really, really. Let the Loregasm begin!",7
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Common Lisp (Expert's Voice in Programming Languages),Learn by example....,"This is ""learn by example"" book. You can learn a lot of stuff using this paradigm, but definitely NOT sophisticated programming language. This book received extremely good reception on comp.lang.lisp - ""Hey, Lisp is not dead - we have new book"". Unfortunately, I don't believe that this book will play essential role in reviving Lisp. I gave up, and converted to K&R of Lisp, namely Winston and Horn",10
Robert S. Newman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Modern Multivariate Statistical Techniques: Regression, Classification, and Manifold Learning (Springer Texts in Statistics)",A great step forward in the way we look at multivariate data,"This book surprised me. I was expecting a book filled with a discussion of mostly traditional multivariate techniques supplemented by a few chapters of more recent developments. Instead, I found a completely new and refreshing approach to statistics and data exploration that framed the classical regression approach to most issues as a special, limiting case of a broader view of data exploration and analysis.

Sections on random vectors and matrices, nonparametric density estimation, tree methods, ANI, support vector machines, random forests, bagging and boosting, latent variables, manifold learning, and other topics are discussed and explored in adequate depth for an introductory text. The book assumes you know matrix algebra and have had some exposure to probability distributions, and common multivariate methods, but it extends the discussion in areas that are usually only covered in separate advanced texts and research papers.

The book is a little light on Bayesian methods but some compromises had to be made considering the bulk of the range of new material discussed. I especially liked the broad array of examples from genetics, medicine, physics, and other application areas and the nice color graphs where needed. The references to Matlab, R, S-Plus and other standard math packages was much appreciated although I would have liked Mathematica to have been included as well.

Overall, this is a wonderful survey of a wide range of multivariate techniques and methods. I hope it gets incorporated in college grad and undergrad courses.",24

calvinnme,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library,A great guide to OpenCV with plenty of context,"This book is excellent at exposing the reader to the various methods available in OpenCV and showing via code examples how to use each one. The author also gives you the website where you can look at the actual source code of each method shown. This is helpful since, for example, if you want to know exactly how the code is going about calculating the Fundamental Matrix, it is difficult to determine this by reading the book alone.

This book would be most useful to someone who already has a fundamental understanding of computer vision and image processing and wants to see how OpenCV will make their programming tasks easier. It does this by coding up well known algorithms into reliable pieces of code that you can use to accomplish more complex tasks. Do not come to this book if you are seeking to learn computer vision. You will only be confused as the author does not offer enough detail to teach you the mathematical foundations. However, I don't think that was his intention at all. Instead it is part user manual, part basic computer vision tutorial and overview, and part idea book. Each chapter is supplemented with excellent and interesting programming exercises that test your knowledge of what has been presented in a practical setting.

For a good basic understanding of computer vision try Computer Vision. To understand the algorithmic underpinnings of 3D computer vision try Introductory Techniques for 3-D Computer Vision. However, before you read either of these you must read Digital Image Processing (3rd Edition), since image processing concepts are fundamental to understanding computer vision tasks. In fact, the two disciplines overlap in many spots. The sad truth of the matter is that no one book will teach you what you need to know to be an effective image scientist. However, this book on OpenCV is essential reading on applying the theory via programming in an effective manner. Highly recommended.",55
David M. Stanwick,4.0 out of 5 stars,Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library,Still The Best OpenCV Book Available,"Despite all the evolution that OpenCV has gone through these last five years, and all the available on-line documentation and newer books that have been published, this is still the most useful and helpful guide. No other book covers the breadth and depth of OpenCV like this one does.

The writing style is a bit too casual sometimes. I have been a tiny bit annoyed by the authors' breezy treatment of some important details that I'm struggling with. Nevertheless, there just isn't a better alternative, or anything even close. I guess I should be grateful that the alternative isn't the case: excessive, impenetrable formality!

Again, this is still the best OpenCV reference available right now.

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library,"Generally good, codes are bad","I like this book as a supplement to understand how opencv works and how you should construct your program. It has clear explanations about the concepts but the codes at the end of explanations are now a bit problematic because they might not be compatible with the new version of opencv (2.4.5 atm). For instance ""cvQueryHistValue_2D"" is now cvSplit and it takes a careful google search to find this out. Except for some problems in the code parts that I mentioned above, the book is good. Especially the comments in the codes give you an idea how to proceed and it is really helpful. If you are not looking to build your entire program from the codes in this book, I would recommend this. Otherwise it is no good to you.",1

It is written with a straight forward and easy to read style and covers both basic image processing like smoothing and averaging as well as more advanced topics like Kalman filters.
What I find particularly appealing about the book is its low level approach. What I mean by that is it tends to give examples and explanations in terms of basic C structures and simple C code. I realize that this style of coding will not appeal to everyone so if you want to use a higher level approach (e.g. C++, python etc.) you may want to look at alternatives (python libraries for OpenCV are available).

William A. Barrett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library,Pattern recognition and computer vision for the C hacker,"As a computer instructor and researcher in biometrics and pattern recognition, I welcome this treatise on OpenCV.
Don't even consider opening the pages unless you are familiar with C, its use of structs, pointers, callback functions and the like. You may also be put off by the various mathematical discussions of various advanced computer vision algorithms that have been developed over the last two decades.
OpenCV is an open-source collaborative work. It's partially supported by the Intel corporation, through their quest for advanced algorithms that might be included in its computer chips. Many low-level tools needed for video and image processing are now provided in advanced Intel microprocessors.
The theme of OpenCV is audacious, yet achievable -- that of providing high-quality, high-performance software tools for the many computer vision algorithms that have been published over the years. That has largely been achieved through the clever use of low-level pointer-based tools, accompanied by complete C source code for everything down to the raw processor instructions.
Other good news is that the system provides an easy portal to advanced Intel hardware support, boosting performance to the highest possible level. One can also port OpenCV-based code to Linux, other Unix and Mac platforms -- it is not restricted to Windows.
I've had some trouble with Windows XP, but the image and camera grabbing functions work well under Windows Vista. I've also been able to exploit the OpenCV tools under Windows MFC to support Windows-based applications.
This O'Reilly book provides the background support that you will need to download the OpenCV system from the internet, configure your development environment and start exploring the magic that its tools can provide.
Perhaps you can also contribute to the effort in the way of reporting bugs and providing tool extensions.
I should point out that most of the OpenCV documentation is also available free through the internet. If you like your docmentation scattered around through numerous HTML links, help yourself. I prefer a clear written dialog and an index to follow the underlying logic of all the functions and their variations described in the book.",6

The main reason for the review was to save some people time if they purchase the book a year after its publication date like me. Getting up and running can be a frustrating task going by the book, when I probably would have been better off just downloading everything without a care in the world.

In the setup section it has a clear warning not to install the Microsoft SDK, otherwise your OpenNI stuff will not work. So I didn't install it. strangely it was working from the OpenNI stuff, but everytime I ran the examples in Processing, just said over and over can't find the device. So I finally gave in and installed the SDK because it sort of said to do so on the SimpleOpenNI site. Everything worked like a charm. There was no mention of this error in the book, and little if any online mention of it.

So..word of caution, even if there was a compatibility issue with the SDK when this book was first written, the open source community has clearly resolved that. INSTALL AWAY!

R. D Johnson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Real-Time C++: Efficient Object-Oriented and Template Microcontroller Programming,You'll love it and hate it at the same time,"If you're not an embedded programmer, move on; there's little here for you.

If, like me, you've had years of embedded programming experience in both C and C++ you will either love or hate this book. Or, like me, you may experience both emotions at the same time. Why? Because it contains equal parts of 'duh, everyone knows that' and 'wow that is clever' exposition and code. It covers old ground like 'replace multiply with shift and add for efficiency' (which isn't even necessarily true anymore on some modern microprocessors) and totally new ground like using lambda expressions for efficiency inside code loops. Like another reviewer states, it illustrates good coding technique, but does so using C++ features that are barely supported on desktop PCs at the time of this review much less embedded compilers or cross-compilers.

I finally settled on four stars because it excels at one task: shaking the complacency out of embedded C programmers who think state-of-the-art C++ and modern coding styles are not suitable for embedded 8 to 32 bit microprocessors. The author does a great job of showing how modern constructs such as templates, lambda expressions, placement new, atomics and the like make embedded code more maintainable without sacrificing performance. The coding style is modern, using namespaces and prefixes, and <stdint> instead of the home-grown portability defines common in embedded C code. The author covers ground many embedded programmers probably already know such as the purpose of main(), how to extract and read assembly listing, use linker map files, and C++ name de-mangling. However, those new to embedded programming may find such information useful. The real meat of the book, though, is its extensive explanation and use of templates, constexpr, lambdas, and other modern C++ techniques to move a lot of programming work to compile-time. It also does a good job of explaining how to write your own memory manager if necessary to make better use of the STL. The book finishes with some example code, including a fixed-point math class and a FIR filter implemented with the aid of templates.

Finally, I have to say this book is probably a little ahead of its time. The code and techniques in this book illustrate the future of embedded programming on the new ARM and AVR class of embedded processors. However, given the conservative nature of the embedded world--where a wrong instruction can blow up an expensive machine--it will be a while still before the tool chains are up-to-date enough and trusted enough to make use of many of the techniques in this book.",21

Michael H. Cox,2.0 out of 5 stars,Real-Time C++: Efficient Object-Oriented and Template Microcontroller Programming,Looks like great content but the Kindle version's typography makes it very difficult to read,"The content of the book (and I suspect the non-digital version) appear to be excellent (based on a scan of the table of contents), but I found the formatting on the Kindle edition lacking. The preface of the book is formatted ""ragged left"" making it very difficult to read. The ""Coding Style"" section in the preface says the code snippets will be formatted with C++ keywords and built-in types formatted in bold and all the code text in fixed-spaced font. Unfortunately, the code and the regular text are all formatted in a bold-face variable-spaced font, making the code more difficult to read and distinguish from the body text. Also, figure title text is difficult to distinguish from adjoining body text and the spacing between section headings and body text appears too small, although thankfully, it's in a larger font.

This is the second time I've purchased this Kindle book, hoping that the problems with the formatting would have been fixed. I've tried reading the book on various Kindle reader apps for PC, Windows 8, and Android and all had they same problem. It looks like I'm going to have to return the Kindle version again. To anyone who bought the paper version, does the paper version have the same problems?? To anyone considering buying this Kindle book, you may want to wait until the formatting is fixed or consider buying the paper book.",8
TomZ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Real-Time C++: Efficient Object-Oriented and Template Microcontroller Programming,Didn't Like This Book,"I read a lot of software engineering books, and generally I'm pretty open to a lot of different ideas and viewpoints. But I really did not like this book. There were two things in general I did not like. First, I felt that the author has not really used C++ in real-time systems for a long time - his approach did not show much depth or insight compared to someone using it for the first time. I had expected to see a lot of new techniques, but I did not.

Second, the author uses a lot of C++11 features, which are not available yet in most (all?) commercial embedded systems compilers. This in itself is not a bad thing, but in this case it allowed the author to side-step some of the more tricky aspects of real-time programming with more widely available dialects of C++. For example, initialization of objects with constant data is a little tricky to do efficiently with today's compilers. The author avoided this topic entirely by advocating use of C++11-specific initialization features.",18
Abacus,4.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for Business with Python: A Very Gentle Introduction to Business Analytics Using Deep Neural Networks,3 for Content 5 for author’s support,"The book is reasonably good. It explains Deep Learning fairly well in a manner that is digestible for the non-PhD (notice the topic is very technical by nature, so it does cater to an audience that has a good understanding of quantitative methods in general). A definite positive associated with this book is that the author gives you exposure and teaches you how to use three different R Deep Learning packages.

However, the narrative includes a few confusing statements. For instance, the author advances that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the equivalent of a series of Log-linear regression models. That’s inaccurate. He meant to say Logit Regression models instead. Also, throughout the book he repeats that it is critical to standardize or scale the variables (using a Min/Max scaling) so as to render them Normally distributed. However, those procedures will not change the shape of the variable. They will only change its scale. So, this argument is not appropriate. I passed my criticism by the author, and he very graciously accepted them.

When it comes to the examples, they are interesting and well explained. But, they are not always replicable. I worked on a couple of chapters. And, at times I derived the same results at other times I got very different results with the same coding as his. I know DNNs can be unstable. So, that may explain some divergence in replication. However, we both started those models with the same seed number embedded in our codes. So, the divergence is puzzling. In one interesting case, he developed a DNN with a reasonably high R Square only to uncover that the underlying correlation between the model’s estimate and the response variable was negative. This seemed mathematically improbable. When I ran the exact same model, I got a much lower R Square than he did. However, the correlation was positive as one would expect.

The author generates much goodwill with his readership. He is passionate about educating and sharing his knowledge. He is readily accessible. He actually helped me out with my coding in one case and very gladly accepted my debating some of the mentioned concepts with him.",3

naroom,4.0 out of 5 stars,Numerical Methods with MATLAB : Implementations and Applications,A student's perspective,"I used this book along with course notes and homework that I found online. My goal was to learn everything in an undergrad-level Numerical Methods course without having to spend the time and money required to take a class. The reason I chose this book was that I am a computer scientist; this book uses a programming-oriented approach to the material than other books do.

I was able to complete the homework in about six weeks. I rarely had to refer to the course notes or to other sources. So, overall the book worked well for me. For most of the topics, it was all I needed.

But, it wasn't a smooth ride the whole way. Some sections, notably Gaussian quadrature, were presented in confusing ways and took me several days to puzzle through. My one criticism of this book is that it uses a great deal of space to show Matlab code (which is available online) and so it does not have space for illustrative diagrams and graphs. So, you really need to run your own Matlab experiments using the provided code to understand the material.",1

The concepts are well illustrated (important for this topic, of course), especially where it comes to how and why a certain image operation works.

I've read many other texts on this subject, and most were either too basic (without explaining why or how things are done), or far too deep in mathematical concepts. This was exactly right. If you understand at least the basics of matrices and calculus (1st year is plenty), you're fully equipped to understand 90% of this book. If you're like me, you may need to do a little side reading, but not much.

Frederick C. Monson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Digital Image Processing: An Algorithmic Introduction Using Java (Texts in Computer Science),"Content is Great, BUT the Binding is Terrible","I have been purchasing books for 70 of my 77 years,and this offering defies the virtual definition of the 'thing.' The book I have, as well as the one that I gave to a student, is almost physically unreadable. In the 1940's, I was instructed that the binding of every new book and text required a standard 'breaking in.' That process was to insure that when one got to the middle of the read, the binding would not break. Thus, before reading this new book, I tried to process this one ----- and failed miserably. Since, every time I try to read this text, I require two bricks to keep it open to the pages I wished to read. Even with that, this book doesn't even resemble any real text I have purchased over my career. The binding is inflexible. It apparently has a metal backing that provides no spring; thus, I cannot both read and take notes which is my normal habit when reading a text. The first English edition was bound in the old manner - it had half the pages and a much more flexible binding. Further, as if to want to make reading as difficult as possible the margin of the pages at the binding are hardly a centimeter, and without a vice to level the page of interest, 2/3 of the page rises from the binding at the center of the book in an arc with a radius less than 2-3 cm and doesn't get close to flat until one reaches the 56-57mm margin on the outside of the page. In this wide margin the printer decided to place the captions of figures RATHER than reducing that margin to a reasonable 25mm or less. So, what I have is a tome whose design is apparently meant to prevent copying AS WELL AS READING! Now, if I wanted to copy the pages, I would 'clip' off the binding and run the pages through any scanner in bulk pieces. REALLY! That being true, I must conclude that, either the 'series editors' or some anonymous 'person' must really despise the authors and their potential readers. Sadly, the authors, the readers, and the sellers are duped by the publisher, in this case, who probably doesn't have quality control at home; for surely, no one educated in either the US or Germany could fail to see the shortcomings of this product. Of course, since I only speak of two purchases, I might have been the one who got the only two 'rascal' products that escaped the QC folks at ""Springer!"" By the way, those parts of the text that I have laboriously read are top notch. Thanks for that, at least. If I cannot find a way to comfortably read this volume, I may decide to excise the offending binder so that I can read the pages in a way that is reasonable - at least for me. BTW, I also have John Russ's ""The Image Processing Handbook, 6th Ed,"" from CRC, 2011. The binding of this 867 page book is bound in the 'proper' manner that enables flat pages at the middle both of whose margins are only 13mm. A most comfortable book to read and learn from. I wish I knew sufficient about the psychology of the recent leaders at Springer, and I hope that they were not hired away from CRC. That would cause me to lose hope completely.",3

Michael Yasumoto,2.0 out of 5 stars,Discrete Mathematics (5th Edition),Comparison of the top 3 Discrete Math Texts,"I have read ""Discrete Mathematics"" by Epp, Rosen and Ross which are the three most common discrete math texts that I encounter at university.

Of these three, I would rate Epp's book as my favorite because it has the clearest explanations and is so easy to read that you can't help but feel like you understand all of the content completely. The only failing that Epp's book might have is that it is not as thorough in its coverage of the material as some of the more technical books. I would say that it covers about 90% of the material and leaves out some of the more obscure topics.

Rosen's book would be the most thorough, covering every topic in meticulous detail and offering a jumping point for other texts in cryptography and number theory. Although this book is more complete than Epp's, it is also less readable and requires more effort to get through. Ideally you would use Epp's book to learn the material and then go to Rosen's book for a technical reference.

For those of you who are considering Ross's book, I have one thing to say and that is don't. Although I have read this book and done a lot of the problems in the first 3/4 of the text, this book is neither clear in its explanations like Epp nor is it as complete as Rosen's book. If you are assigned this book for a course, my suggestion would be to buy Epp's book and photocopy the Ross homework problems from a friend's textbook.

Take the advice of someone who has read all three books. If you have to buy just one, then get the Epp book. It is better to understand 90% of the material completely rather than 100% of the material partially.",24

Shankar Saikia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Principles of Data Mining (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning),GREAT INTRO TO DATA MINING,"I bought this book because I wanted a relatively high level (not too high level, but high level enough to give me a good foundation in the theory and issues) to data mining. My goal was to first understand the theory and principles of data mining before getting into the technological and application specifics (e.g., how to use software such as Dataminer or R or Weka or SPSS Clementine etc.).

This book has met my goals. Most chapters include abstract math/statistics that may be a little challenging for people who do not have a recent high level undergraduate statistics background. Actually I enjoyed the math/stats, and did not worry about going too deep into those portions. Trust me, the abstract concepts are not easy to grasp beyond a certain point, but they are EXTREMELY valuable. I am really glad that I was challeged. If you want another perspective or intro to data mining you may want to read some of the lecture notes of the ""Machine Learning"" course from MIT's online courseware - the courses are available for free on MIT's online courseware site. The lecture notes are even more abstract - they will make you appreciate this book.

I highly recommend that anyone who wants to get an intro to data mining should first read this book.

I will give the author some benefit of doubt as I did not perform any of the experiments because you need your own robot, such as an accessorized iRobot Create, in order to perform the experiments and exercises. A robot and controllers can easily set you back $300-$500.

The book does not actually get down to the fundamentals of designing and fabricating your own robot although it devotes adequate space to the discussion of the advantages of different sorts of motor drives and sensors.

It was disappointing to me that author carefully distinguishes between a physical robot and a computer emulation and devotes almost no time to robot simulations.

If you're looking for a solid reference that you can come back to and help you solve actual robotics problems, look elsewhere.

David W. Nicholas,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Quest for Artificial Intelligence,A timely history of artificial intelligence,"It is wise for practitioners in a field to know its history.

""The Quest for Artificial Intelligence"" is as comprehensive and readable a history of AI as I have encountered, covering the fields it developed out of through the collection of fields it has become today.

Nilsson is a part of that history, having made contributions to heuristic search, planning, and other areas of AI. He gives his own work fair coverage in the panorama of issues, problems, and large scale questions that have shaped AI since its inception.

""The Quest for Artificial Intelligence"" compares favorably with Margaret Boden's massive, two volume history of cognitive science (AI being one of the cognitive sciences) ""Mind As Machine."" Nilsson's book is the one to read if you want a detailed understanding of what artificial intelligence is and has been, with enough technical detail to satisfy a student of AI while remaining readable and interesting to the educated layman.

Joshua Reuben,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Quest for Artificial Intelligence,A good refresher on the state of AI,"After reading Russell & Norvig's amazing tome, this is a great high level refresher of the concepts covered there.
For an aspiring software engineer interested in developing algorithms that simulate the steps of a thought process, this book helps one understand:
A) what is currently possible, what is not possible & what is nearly possible :) ;
B) what approaches have hit dead ends & what alternative approaches superseded them;
C) what subcategories of AI research exist, & how they can be integrated
D) what areas of AI research are being actively investigated today and show promise of further advances.
E) how we stand upon the shoulders of giants [some amazing programmatic investigations took place before most script kiddies and raving transhumanists were even conceived].

In a way this last point is slightly melancholic - since the failure of the Japanese 5th Generation Computer Systems project (FGCS) in the 1980s, programming largely consists of re-inventing information systems ad nauseum. And yet cognitive science hints that the human brain is Turing Equivalent - unfortunately, the demand for immediate ROI stymies the effort to automate more tasks. This book is a potent reminder that programmers should strive to understand how to code outside this box.

In this book, individual topics pop up again and again in interleaved fashion as the author's single timeline unfolds. This may be a bit disconcerting for readers not already well versed in the field. Other advantages of a modular approach to the history of AI rather than a simple sequential approach are ease of updating the text for future editions and the ability of subject matter experts to quickly find and provide constructive feedback in their areas of expertise.

A minor irritation was the use of URLs in body text rather than confining them to end notes. Most authors would like their books to be timeless; the use of highly fragile URLs in body text seems to contradict this goal.

I suspect that this is the best history of AI we have so far. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the field.",2

Denise,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Career Architect Development Planner, 4th Edition",Career Development Tool,"This reference has been incredibly helpful to me both in charting my professional growth as well as in helping those working in my department with suggested actions for professional growth in specific areas.

The book identifies professional competences and defines what each skill 'looks like' when you are unskilled, skilled and even defines overuse which is very helpful. I've even used these definitions when preparing evaluations as they are wonderfully descriptive.

This tool suggests multiple short and long term strategies for development of each competency. Great book!",4

Sherry-Ann Zeltman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence in the 21st Century (Computer Science),“Artificial Intelligence in the 21st Century” by Lucci and Kopec is excellent treatise on AI and I highly recommend it,"“Artificial Intelligence in the 21st Century” by Lucci and Kopec is a resourceful, book that is user friendly with illustrative and intellectual appeal. After reading Chapter One I was hooked by the interesting historical overview and discourse of salient issues and research areas in the field.
I work in the medical profession and I am fascinated by the prospect of a computer performing at or near the level of a human being. Advances in computer science and medical technology created the electronic health record; diagnostic equipment for the early detection and treatment of cancer; minimally invasive surgery using robotic techniques and congestive heart failure remote monitoring programs.
My special interest in artificial intelligence (AI) is expert systems. Early AI systems often used the medical arena as a test bed. So, naturally I skipped to Chapter Nine which served as an insightful introduction to this field.
Learning is another branch of AI that has intrigued me; how does one build systems that are capable over time to improve their performance? I found Chapter Eleven to be fascinating. The discussion on simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and ant colony optimization were enlightening.
The mathematics in Chapter Ten on neural networks was a tad overwhelming, as I am not a math major. However, I really like the conversational tone, graphics and illustrations which make this text book user friendly.
I especially like the “Human Interest Notes” that provide a snap shot and overview of prolific contributors in the field of AI.
I found the “Questions for Discussion” and “Exercises” well structured, original and designed to stimulate sustained interest and provide an in-depth understanding of the topics.
Chapter Fifteen presents an impressive and exciting review of the present and future of AI.
One last comment: Inductive Learning is a popular methodology used in medicine. I hope that later editions of this text will include an expanded discussion of this approach. All in all, I found this text book to be an excellent treatise on AI and I highly recommend it to others.",4
MyBooks,5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence in the 21st Century (Computer Science),Great introduction to AI,"This is a great textbook which elucidates the field of AI without unnecessarily obfuscating it with technical complexity. That is not to say that the material is trivial - not at all - and some chapters like Neural Networks are very mathematical, but in general the tone is not overly pedantic like some AI texts can be, but more conversational with the intention of eliciting curiosity and encouraging independent thinking. I would say that the underlying theme of the book is problem solving, which includes learning through solving problems, thinking about how humans solve problems, and how to make computers solve problems intelligently.
The book is very comprehensive in that it covers a broad range of topics in AI from Neural Networks to Expert Systems. It's also full of Human Interest notes that pay homage to the great thinkers and doers in the field of AI. After finishing this textbook I think any interested student would be very comfortable delving into a more rigorous domain-specific text.",3
JARED R CLEMENCE,4.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence in the 21st Century (Computer Science),A fantastic overview of the field,"The book is a great overview of the science. It covers many topics, but goes into none of them in depth. I enjoy the frequent addition of side-bar biographies of key people. After reading this book, you should have a good understanding of the layout of the field of Artificial Intelligence as it stands today, and have an idea of where you would like to start searching next for deeper understanding. While the book does have you 'get your feet wet' with several questions and programming challenges at the end of each chapter, you should not expect to be an expert in any one of the fields of AI when you finish reading this overview.",1

I strongly recommend people who is interested in AI and want to explore more in AI to read this book. It is also suitable for people without any previous knowledge about AI and computer science. The only required thing is that you have interest in AI and want to have a good understanding about the inside of AI, not only with the hollywood movies.

A particular bonus in this volume is the detailed historical description of the evolution of the idea - and precise definition - of intuitive computability throughout the 20th century, including brief characterizations of the key personalities involved in it: not at all a collection of regular university professors. The book is well-written and fun to read!",1
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A New Synthesis,Good general overview,"The field of artificial intelligence has an interesting history, both in terms of its content and the philosophical debate it has provoked. The field could also be loosely described as divided into two camps, those who view it as a collection of highly sophisticated algorithms, and those who view it as an attempt to create machines that exhibit human-level intelligence. Ironically, in the latter camp, it is difficult to assess the progress that has been made, since criteria for measuring machine intelligence are never explicitly given. Instead, dependence has been made on the ""Turing test"" for intelligence, a test that is difficult to apply, and in fact can be said to be too vague for a practical, objective assessment of machine intelligence.
This book is written more in the context of the latter camp, than in the former. However, in-depth discussion of the Turing test is not given, and this actually is one of the main virtues of the book, although the author clearly believes that the purpose of doing research in artificial intelligence is to achieve human-level intelligence. As he remarks in the last paragraph in the book, it was written to overview the techniques that he believes are required to achieve human-level intelligence. Although he does not explicitly give the reader tests for machine intelligence that will allow progress to be measured, he devotes a small portion of the book to various ideas on just what constitutes intelligence.
The book also gives a general (and sometimes very brief) overview of the algorithms used in artificial intelligence. Search heuristics, neural networks, and genetic programming are some of the topics that are covered. The influence of the ""intelligent agent"" paradigm, that is now taking the AI community by storm, is very apparent throughout the book. The author though does not neglect some of the topics in ""good-ole-fashioned"" artificial intelligence that arose decades ago and is still applicable today, especially in the field of logic programming. These topics include resolution in both the propositional and predicate calculus, and in expert systems. By far the best discussion in the book is on knowledge-based systems and evolving knowledge bases. This topic has taken on considerable importance in recent years due to the importance of data mining and business intelligence.
Readers who are considering artificial intelligence as a career choice will find good motivation by reading this book. The field also is quite different than most others in that it respects a high degree of individual creativity and ingenuity, and has a high bandwidth for new ideas. Beginning with its origins in the 1950s, the field has grown by leaps and bounds, but its applications have exploded in the last five years, fueled mainly by business and financial applications. Concerned not only with achieving human-level capabilities, but also with other forms of intelligence and how they can be useful, artificial intelligence has become one of the predominant forces in the twenty-first century. One can only be excited and optimistic about its further advances.",6

While this book started off with some promise, less than halfway through, it started feeling like Martine Rothblat's 'campaign' to be the architect of the implementation on a wider scale of her whole ""mindclone/midware"" vision, and little else. If - and only if - it does come to fruition, just as she describes it, than her book may very well be the textbook people turn to.

Abel Brown,2.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Belief Nets in C++ and CUDA C: Volume 1: Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Supervised Feedforward Networks,Poor Self-Publishing Effort -- Many Better Resources Available,"I really wanted to like these books but the quality is just too low. TM thinks that just b/c some C++ code is included that the writing doesn't matter. The explanations of core concepts are terrible. There are many typos and confusing sentences and even whole paragraphs that just don't make sense. Much of the content for the other two books just copies content word for word from each other. There is very little in the other two volumes. Literally, whole sections are copied and pasted into Vol 2 and Vol 3. There a very few diagrams of anything and the diagrams and graphs that are included are of such low quality as to not be useful. I really want to support self publishing but these books are basically C++ code documentation. With all the DNN frameworks available such as Caffe, Torch, Theano, TensorFlow, CNTK there really isn't much point in studying this guys C++ code. Not to mention there is cuDNN with many of these core operations implemented.

There are many good resources on the internet that are of much higher quality. Checkout Michael Nielsen's free on-line book, also deep learning dot net has many good resources. Additionally NVIDIA offers self-study course for deep learning (just google) and also their deep learning institute (again just google).",26

Jon Archer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM): A Practical Introduction and Survival Guide,Very worthwhile read,"I very much enjoyed this book, which was a surprise to some extent -- although I was eager to learn about DICOM I fully anticipated a very dry, dull book. Luckily that is not the case. Moreover, the detailed explanations were great for me as a software developer now working on a DICOM application.

Part I - Introduction to DICOM provides a light but good overview.

Part II - DICOM and Clinical Data, after some brief history, gets right into the guts of what DICOM looks like, down to the bytes in a DICOM object. Lots of great stuff there. There's also some excellent information on medical images, compression, video and overlays.

Part III - DICOM Communications does a great job explaining the networking half of the DICOM standard. This is not something I've needed to know much about but was readable and definitely adds to my understanding. I can see that being useful in various application design decision in the coming years.

Part IV - DICOM Media and Security makes clear the media sections of the standard were every bit as crazy as I thought them to be. The security stuff treats anonymization/de-identification well too.

Part V - Advanced Topics is a fairly wide ranging set of topics. The teleradiology chapter was useful although I felt a little thin..although there is some good advice in there I felt there was also some confusing, contradictory and vague information. The coverage of the work the author did with PACS etc. in a post-Katrina New Orleans is pretty eye opening. The DICOM software development chapter was a little bit of a disappointment to me, although I acknowledge it is but one chapter rather than the entire focus of the book. Mostly deals with things to consider if you were to write DICOM software at level of being able to read/write DICOM files and communicate with DICOM compliant AEs. That advice is useful...but I would imagine more of us are utilizing libraries like dcm4che, ClearCanvas etc. and writing applications on top of those -- there's not really any advice for folks in that situation.

All in all, well worth the price.

One complaint: it's a HUGE shame that the Kindle edition is the 1st edition of the book. You can only (seemingly) get this updated 2nd edition as hardback.",3

The book also includes the way how to develop DICOM apps, this is very good information for the developers. The author was also responsible for DICOM system recovery after Katrina and he shared his experiences in the book. This is very important information for the hospital IT engineers and DICOM app developers. I like this book very much.",1

What is missing from other books is the practical knowledge, the problems encountered and the solutions. This book is replete with practical anecdotes.

This is a ""must-own"" book for anyone who must deal with DICOM & PACS. The author does an excellent job of presenting the basics, and then adding more advanced information in a logical progression. This book replaces all others, in my opinion.

There are 18 chapters. Depending upon the background and interests of the reader, many chapters can be skimmed or skipped. This is also an excellent guide to troubleshooting a DICOM system.

Stephen T.

If you want to understand the machine vision algorithms that would be used in ANY language, this text is for you.

The concepts are well illustrated (important for this topic, of course), especially where it comes to how and why a certain image operation works.

I've read many other texts on this subject, and most were either too basic (without explaining why or how things are done), or far too deep in mathematical concepts. This was exactly right. If you understand at least the basics of matrices and calculus (1st year is plenty), you're fully equipped to understand 90% of this book. If you're like me, you may need to do a little side reading, but not much.

Like any text book, there are some errata, so be sure and download those from their web site, where they also supply all the sample code, and links to ImageJ if you want to use that too.

Frederick C. Monson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Digital Image Processing: An Algorithmic Introduction Using Java (Texts in Computer Science),"Content is Great, BUT the Binding is Terrible","I have been purchasing books for 70 of my 77 years,and this offering defies the virtual definition of the 'thing.' The book I have, as well as the one that I gave to a student, is almost physically unreadable. In the 1940's, I was instructed that the binding of every new book and text required a standard 'breaking in.' That process was to insure that when one got to the middle of the read, the binding would not break. Thus, before reading this new book, I tried to process this one ----- and failed miserably. Since, every time I try to read this text, I require two bricks to keep it open to the pages I wished to read. Even with that, this book doesn't even resemble any real text I have purchased over my career. The binding is inflexible. It apparently has a metal backing that provides no spring; thus, I cannot both read and take notes which is my normal habit when reading a text. The first English edition was bound in the old manner - it had half the pages and a much more flexible binding. Further, as if to want to make reading as difficult as possible the margin of the pages at the binding are hardly a centimeter, and without a vice to level the page of interest, 2/3 of the page rises from the binding at the center of the book in an arc with a radius less than 2-3 cm and doesn't get close to flat until one reaches the 56-57mm margin on the outside of the page. In this wide margin the printer decided to place the captions of figures RATHER than reducing that margin to a reasonable 25mm or less. So, what I have is a tome whose design is apparently meant to prevent copying AS WELL AS READING! Now, if I wanted to copy the pages, I would 'clip' off the binding and run the pages through any scanner in bulk pieces. REALLY! That being true, I must conclude that, either the 'series editors' or some anonymous 'person' must really despise the authors and their potential readers. Sadly, the authors, the readers, and the sellers are duped by the publisher, in this case, who probably doesn't have quality control at home; for surely, no one educated in either the US or Germany could fail to see the shortcomings of this product. Of course, since I only speak of two purchases, I might have been the one who got the only two 'rascal' products that escaped the QC folks at ""Springer!"" By the way, those parts of the text that I have laboriously read are top notch. Thanks for that, at least. If I cannot find a way to comfortably read this volume, I may decide to excise the offending binder so that I can read the pages in a way that is reasonable - at least for me. BTW, I also have John Russ's ""The Image Processing Handbook, 6th Ed,"" from CRC, 2011. The binding of this 867 page book is bound in the 'proper' manner that enables flat pages at the middle both of whose margins are only 13mm. A most comfortable book to read and learn from. I wish I knew sufficient about the psychology of the recent leaders at Springer, and I hope that they were not hired away from CRC. That would cause me to lose hope completely.",3

However, this is probably not the best book for biology researchers who have only an elementary knowledge of Java and are trying to teach themselves about image processing.",1
The Sunburned Surveyor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Digital Image Processing: An Algorithmic Introduction Using Java (Texts in Computer Science),Great Book On Java Image Processing,"I bought this book because I was interested in learning more about how to work with raster data (images) in geospatial programs.

Let's Compare Options Preptorial,5.0 out of 5 stars,Interactive Theorem Proving and Program Development,Must Have as Foundation but Also Update With Web Resources,"Coq is a semi automated, interactive theorem prover (colloquially a proof assistant) that works with both math and programming expressions. It's coded in OCaml, it's a generally functional paradigm, and its typing discipline is static and strong. Typing in developing new programming languages is about ontology and taxonomy (how classes, objects, organization, methods, classifications and much more are set up and separated), NOT typing on a keyboard. Typing is the way programs check for consistency, which is a kind of error detection and/or avoidance, and thus VERY relevant to Coq.

Speaking of typing, you MUST understand typing to use this book. Any book on developing new programming languages (and some on DSLs) will cover typing if written after the 90's (/during oop season), but if you have cash to burn, Ben Pierce is the go to guy on that: Types and Programming Languages, available used for about $30+ US on Amazon.

Both the 2004 and 2005 hardcover and paperback of this book are the same, so shop for the best price. These books cover several releases back, and the stable releases from 2013 and up are not backward compatible. The software is freely available at coq dot inria dot fr, and you will need it to use this book. Ssreflect, a significant new set of tools for Coq, also is freely available and is not covered except on the website. (You CANNOT get this book on a website, or free, the documentation does NOT include this book's pedagogy).

This book is a MUST as a great general intro to how, where and why to use Coq. All the documentation information in this book, as well as a tutorial, are available on the inria website, but are not organized for learning or for beginners, autodidacts or self study as this fine text is. BUT the weaknesses of the book being dated are made up for on the website, which DOES have an 8.4 and above tutorial that you will understand easily after studying this book. Note that this is still the ONLY well written, BEGINNERS intro to Coq!

Coq USED to be (when this book was written) a research and development tool, and basically non-commercial. However, since that time, Coq has proven a number of practical theorems and has validated two new optimizing compilers (CompCert for C and one for Java). Because of this, Coq has suddenly become the ""go to"" solver/ proof engine for new languages that have to be validated and bulletproof at launch. I write domain specific languages for robotics, and although I don't achieve bulletproof in my compiles (which are at the VHDL/ circuit level), Coq is a wonderful ""debugging"" tool as well. It doesn't provide the level of code generation of Isabelle, but other than that is clearly the top proof assistant available.

Experience in OCaml is a plus, and Haskell is ""almost"" a necessity if you are developing a compiler to interact with the OCaml. Haskell's ""lazy"" access system also allows you to deluge the compiler with test junk that's only used if needed, so you don't have to worry about blowing out your memory when Coq decides to gallop. This book is for mature developers of new languages, and programmers that are interested in checking their code in a semi automated fashion, so obviously you need to know how to code-- well-- to use this book and these tools.

Mark on Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Essentials Of Discrete Mathematics (The Jones & Bartlett Learning Inernational Series in Mathematics),Best book on discrete math I've yet found,"This book is written and illustrated in a manner that is clear and precise, while using plain English. Terminology is explained. Intermediate steps are explained. Dependencies between chapters and sections are clearly marked. Exercises and examples are relevant and progress from simple to complex. A good breadth of subject matter is covered. For the reader who is not particularly mathematically-inclined, but who needs to master the fundamentals of discrete mathematics, (such as for computer science), this is an outstanding book, head and shoulders above any other I've used (and, to get a grip on discrete math, algorithms, and optimization, I've been reading A LOT of them lately).",15
Acesion,5.0 out of 5 stars,Essentials Of Discrete Mathematics (The Jones & Bartlett Learning Inernational Series in Mathematics),Simple and clear.,I used this book for two logic courses. The book is laid out in a straightforward logical(I would expect as much from such a book) fashion. You should be able to go from the first to the last chapter without a need to jump around to connect concepts as they simply build upon one another. Each chapter is also self contained meaning that if you only wanted to learn about graph theory you could skip to that section and read it and be able to understand it without needing to consult other chapters which is nice when you take a semester break between logic courses. The best part are the problem sections which the book provides detailed answers for. Unlike most math books which only detail a few steps or simply give you an answer to reference this book will actually lead you through the process of solving the problems which is immensely helpful.,13

Ethan Bienstock,4.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods,This textbook does an excellent job developing the mathematics and providing intuition behind SVMs,"This textbook does an excellent job developing the mathematics and providing intuition behind SVMs. That being said, This textbook assumes you have a firm grasp on vector calculus and linear algebra. Chapters 1 and 2 provide a good overview of how machine learning can be used in classification and linear regression. Chapter 5 is an overview of what is covered in most introductory multivariate calculus classes. However, chapter 3 and chapter 4 are not easy. If you lack a background in real analysis you can read the first four or five pages of each chapter and get a basic idea of what is being discussed. Some of the proofs could use a bit more explanation, but at the same time they are mathematically rigorous and concise.

Lastly, the author makes mention that you can read the book out of order. Here's the order that I read: chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 5, chapter 3, chapter 6, chapter 4, chapter 8, and then chapter 7. I think this order gave me enough background information and motivated me to delve into the mathematical theory.

Sandro Saitta,4.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods,More for mathematicians than computer scientist,"This book introduces the concepts of kernel-based methods and focuses specifically on Support Vector Machines (SVM). It is hard to read and a good background in mathematic is clearly needed. The book has a strong emphasis on SVM starting from the very first line of text. Concepts are well explained, although equations are not clear. The notation doesn't facilitate the reading at all. The book covers linear as well as kernel learning. The kernel trick is well described. It is easy to understand ideas behind SVM while reading the corresponding chapter. Finally a small chapter on SVM applications is proposed. Unfortunately, it only contains typical SVM applications (i.e. standard problems).

I think this book is good if you:

* Have a strong mathematical background

* Work in the specific domain of SVM (or kernel-based methods in general)

* Want to write a research paper about SVM and need the correct notations

However, this book is NOT intended for people who:

* Don't like to read theorems, corollaries and remarks

* Are not interested in reading hundreds of proofs

This is my personal opinion as a computer scientist: this book is definitely written for mathematicians.",36

Bookworm,3.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Time Series Forecasting with Python: An Intuitive Introduction to Deep Learning for Applied Time Series Modeling,following the codes in the first few chapters was not easy. First,"The book is intended to give a quick introduction to Python based implementation of neural nets and time series analysis. It covers a wide range of topics focusing on how to do the analysis using various Python libraries. While I have not tried all the tools yet, following the codes in the first few chapters was not easy. First, you have to have a Python 2.7 based environment to ensure compatibility with some of the required 3rd party libraries. Second, the per-processing of data was done rather clumsily (associated codes could be significantly polished). I suspect that some of the transformations can be done more efficiently using pandas. The author is obviously very knowledgeable and does mention that his intention is to show how to process raw data for various models and not to write highly 'Pythonic' codes. But even as an intermediate level Python hobbyist, I found the codes to be somewhat sloppy. The book also has typos and a very poor formatting. I found the inconsistent use of font size and style very distracting. There is no doubt the book has been greatly rushed without the benefit of professional editing and design. In short, the contents are great, the intention is good as well, but the delivery is poor. I would like to see that the contents are updated for Python 3 and all typos and editing issues addressed in the next version.",2
John M. Ford,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Handbook of Natural Language Processing, Second Edition (Chapman & Hall/CRC Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition)",Climbing the Steep Curve of Natural Language Processing,"This is the second edition of Nitkin Indurkhya and Fred Damerau's guide to natural language processing (NLP). Damerau passed away before this edition was published, but his contributions are present and acknowledged throughout. Like the first edition, this volume has a practical focus and is targeted at language-engineering professionals. Its stated goals are to focus on practical tools and techniques and discuss NLP as it pertains to input to and output from computer systems. The second edition includes greater coverage of NLP in non-English languages and has a companion wiki with post-publication content and links to useful online resources.

The handbook is organized into three sections. The first, Classical Approaches, covers historical and foundational roots of the field. Its chapters introduce techniques for organizing text data, parsing it into words and other meaningful units, and conducting basic syntactic and semantic analyses. A final chapter introduces language generation. The second section presents modern empirical/statistical NLP. It divides the territory as linguists would expect. Separate chapters cover creation and management of large samples of language, statistical techniques, parsing and part-of-speech tagging, word sense disambiguation, and speech recognition and translation. The third selection examines some representative NLP applications, including machine translation, question answering, and text mining.

The book presents a great deal of densely-technical information in a fairly readable manner. (The statistics chapter is an exception; it could use additional detail and a less theory-driven emphasis.) It is not intended as a textbook, so the reader shouldn't expect much hand-holding. Nor is the coverage of topics comprehensive. But there are numerous useful references in the text and links in the book's wiki to more detailed sources. Although there are no exercises per se, the example procedures are presented well. It is a useful handbook and reference that is comparable to--and updates--Manning and Schuetze's Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing.

So check it out of the library and give it a skim. If you are working in this area, consider obtaining your own mark-up-able desk copy.",6

calvinnme,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Spoken Language Processing: A Guide to Theory, Algorithm and System Development",A classic and comprehensive resource,"This book is a comprehensive overview of most of the major topics associated with speech processing. Divided into five main sections, the book is well structured with a clear division of concerns. The title, ""Spoken Language Processing"", may be misleading to some as language processing topics only accounts for one section of the book.

The first two sections cover the fundamental theories that should be understood before embarking in-depth into a study of speech processing. This may seem an obvious approach but many texts do not follow this pattern making their use as reference tomes limited. Separating background theory from its use is also useful in that it allows a rigorous approach to its description. Too often texts give a hurried imprecise overview of theories used before launching into a long and complex use of the theory; losing the reader instantly in a quagmire of formulae.

The first two sections of the book deals with background material, material that the reader should at least understand the key concepts of. The first section concentrates on speech in general (including production and perception), probability and statistics, and pattern classification. These last two topics mentioned are both important parts of the book and are dealt with in their own chapters. Both are well written with the right amount of explanation and background. Much of the remainder of the book expects at least some familiarity with the material presented here. These chapters, like all chapters in the book finish with a section entitled, ""Historical Perspective and Further Reading"". The inclusion of recommended further reading, in addition to the vast number of references appearing in each chapter, make the book as a whole a very good starting point for any work in speech processing.

The second section concerns itself with the DSP topics which relate to speech processing. In this section the reader will find everything from FFTs to multi-rate signal processing and speech signal representations to speech coding. Again the section is well written and the reader is not forced to refer to other texts to understand what is written. If a topic is not expanded upon here then it is an indication that is not dealt further in any great depth in the remainder of the book.

The third section of the book covers speech recognition and is probably the section which will find most use with many readers. This section is very thorough in its treatment of the subject. It starts immediately with a discussion of Hidden Markov Models which is almost exclusively the method employed in the pattern matching stage of speech recognition. Any algorithms that are mentioned are also detailed which really make the book useful. In fact algorithms are presented throughout the book making it a practical reference as much as a theoretical one. This is important because there is a big jump from understanding theory to being able to implement an algorithm to exploit that theory. Other topics covered include an excellent chapter on environmental robustness with one of the best discussions of microphones I have seen. Language modelling and search algorithms are given a thorough treatment. I would like to have seen more detailed information on front-end processing and endpoint detection, as this remains a critical stage of the recognition process. Perhaps the level of detail reflects the fact that this is currently a hot research topic with potential for significant advancement.

Section four, on text-to-speech processing, is a good overview of the field and better than any book I've seen on the subject. It shows numerous block diagrams of what you need to build such a system and gives numerous algorithms in pseudocode. It also dedicates a subsection to each block of the text-to-speech system block diagram, discussing in detail what you would need to do to implement that particular block. Since much of the individual blocks have been discussed earlier in the book, it refers you back to specific earlier sections for details.

The fifth section is a short one on entire systems and shows some case studies, concentrating on what Microsoft was doing at the time this book was published, since that is where the authors' research came from. I would highly recommend that anyone anticipating getting into speech processing have a copy of this classic nearby.",5

Theo Dee,4.0 out of 5 stars,Understanding Beliefs (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series),Not what I expected,"While I still enjoyed reading this addition to the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, as it was short, concise, and mostly on point, there were a couple of things I was disappointed by.

First of all, a better title for the book would have been What Do We Mean By ""Beliefs""? The author does a great job of breaking down what beliefs *are* and how they relate to ""reality"", ""truth"", and ""objectivity"". For this reason alone, I would recommend the book.

What I was hoping for, which the author did not deliver on as strongly, was a better understanding of *why* people hold irrational beliefs (psychological and emotional reasons, pragmatic reasons, lack of perspective, brain development and family upbringing, etc.) While there are other places you can find this information, such as in David McRaney's books (You Are Not So Smart and You Are Now Less Dumb), I ""believed"" that I would find such information in Nilsson's book.

Another aspect of the book I found annoying were the long-winded examples of certain beliefs and how science evolved in particular areas. Some that come to mind are the sections on global warming, heliocentricism, physics, and evolution. These are dropped on the reader quite randomly and go on longer than they should. They take up a sizable portion of the book, which could have been used for other subjects, such as ""Possible causes of holding irrational beliefs"". Each of the examples above should have taken no more than a single page to cover. This book is not about any of the above topics.

With all of that said, I would still recommend this book to get a fundamental understanding of what beliefs are, and how you can apply this knowledge to yourself and those around you.",7
Kevin L. Nenstiel,4.0 out of 5 stars,Understanding Beliefs (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series),Belief as Window to the World,"Don’t misunderstand this book’s title. Nils Nilsson, an engineer and artificial intelligence specialist, isn’t interested in how we usually understand “beliefs,” which may mean religious convictions, opinions held without ironclad evidence, or partisan loyalties. Rather, Nilsson focuses on how we know concepts. While philosophers debate how we comprehend processes—riding a bike, speaking our native tongue, whatever—Nilsson questions how we know facts.

Nilsson begins with the premise that we cannot know very much directly. We devise a schema of the world around us based on evidence, testimony, and supposition, then assume this as our belief. This may involve how we believe (or disbelieve) scientific phenomena, like global warming, or how we believe society functions, or how past experience is relevant to current circumstances. Nilsson describes the ways we construct beliefs from limited evidence, and explain the entire world through partial glimpses.

Vernacular attitudes, Nilsson acknowledges, often receive “beliefs” as less solid or less worthy than “facts.” Nilsson quotes a friend saying “I don’t believe it, I know it,” as though belief is flimsy. Yet as Nilsson persuasively demonstrates, we actually know very little about the world, in the sense of having incontrovertible proof. It’s not possible to know, for instance, the contents of other people’s minds, or the behavior of forces we cannot sense, or the span of history from before our births to after our deaths.

That’s just a sample of the limits Nilsson puts on “knowledge.” We know very little directly. Consider how we know about social structures. We have sensory evidence about how people behave around us. But what about people far away, or people unlike ourselves? We have only the testimony of narratives, statistics, and other people’s stories. We mix our experience with others’ testimonies, draw conclusions, and apply them outward from there. These conclusions aren’t “facts,” no matter how virulently paid pundits ballyhoo them. They are beliefs.

Anyone who’s ever sat next to a three-year-old, though, knows the question that follows from any belief: “Why?” Individual beliefs we may hold, which we could structure as declarative statements ( i.e. “Markets will correct for shortages of supply”) are generally buttressed by supporting beliefs (“Prices reflect both supply and demand”). Nilsson describes complex belief networks, such as Bayesian belief networks, that describe ways humans support what they believe by increasing degrees of complexity.

Beliefs, in Nilsson’s formulation, should always be held lightly. We may believe Principle X, but we should always remain willing to test our beliefs against new, countervailing evidence. This means we should communicate with people who don’t share our beliefs, and should prize the belief-making process more highly than maintaining intellectual constancy. He admits this is easier said than done. However, we can regard certain tests and their outcomes as legitimating the processes of belief.

In advancing this claim, Nilsson includes the lengthiest, most complete description I’ve yet read of the scientific method. Whereas my high school teachers presented a simple four-step process of hypothesis, experiment, conclusion, and repetition, Nilsson describes a complicated process that is intensely social, cumulative in detail, and exuberantly sloppy. Though it isn’t nearly as dispassionate as schoolteachers might present, scientific method permits us to conduct reliable, repeatable tests to verify and refine our beliefs.

I must dispute one statement. Nilsson asserts that beliefs which we cannot subject to scientific scrutiny have no practical value and should be discarded. He means belief in transcendence and the supernatural, but this gives me pause. After all, what scientific scrutiny tells us that democracy is better than totalitarianism? Capitalism better than communism? Historical outcomes aren’t experimental results, especially since they can’t be retried. We all hold many beliefs that defy exacting scientific scrutiny.

Indeed, I’m not the first to observe that belief in scientific reliability is itself not scientific. Nilsson and I may agree that science provides reliable indicators about our physical world, and that drawing conclusions about tangible reality from evidence is better than drawing it from ancient testament. However, science provides spotty foundation for, say, managing your marriage, or raising your children, because impersonal forces differ from relationships. I believe in science. I also believe in its limits.

That quibble notwithstanding, Nilsson’s exposition on how humans know what we know is very illuminating. As a primer on scientific epistemology, it helps us make decisions about how we treat the knowledge we have, how we revise it, and how we defend or discard would-be facts. I’d recommend this text to schoolchildren worldwide, because we need more adults who know how they know.",4

SLB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Digital Image Processing Using Matlab,Great book!,"This is a great book, BUT I think you need to be an engineer to understand it. The book assumes the reader has knowledge of concepts such as probability theory, statistics, and other mathematical concepts like functions, transforms, histograms, PDFs, CDFs, filtering, least-squares, convolution, MMSE, etc. (which I do because I am a wireless communications engineer). I think it also helps to have knowledge of Matlab already, else you will be reading the book very slowly trying to simultaneously understand the image processing concepts and the Matlab code used to implement them. You also must have the image processing toolbox that comes with Matlab to run the code presented, or you will not be able to use it. If you have all these things, it's a very good book. The authors explain the concepts clearly and present all the code - so even if you don't understand every word in the text, you can look at the code and figure it out (or run the code to see what it does), or vice versa. The text and code complement each other nicely. The code is not commented line by line, but general comments are given, and they are usually enough to understand what each function does, and what its inputs and outputs are. Many custom functions are presented, which you can run even if you don't understand every detail but understand the function in general. The book also does a good job of covering both introductory and advanced concepts. What I especially like is that the authors give lots of examples, with code and pictures, to aid in understanding.

I am learning a lot from it. Being There clarifies several complex issues by, among other things, providing vivid examples.

My only criticisms are minor:
- About halfway through the book, it started to get a bit repetitive. I didn't need to be told again and again that perception and cognition are active and use the world as its own memory.
- There are a few errors. E.g., page 29 puts the area of high visual resolution (i.e., the fovea) at ""0.01 percent"" of the retina. It's 1 percent (0.01) of the retina, not 0.01 percent.",4
Shawn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics",A nice opposite view of mainstream AI thoughts,"As a junior Ph.D. student who hopes to have a career in the research of artificial intelligence (machine learning or deep learning more precisely), I was reading this book as a touch on the opposite of the belief that intelligence is achievable by machines. Apart from several of his dramatic tones towards mocking A.I. (what was that story in the pro- and epi-logue about?), this book has been a very enjoyable experience for me.

Roger Penrose is definitely one scientist that holds a very strong opinion on this opposite, and I do have to say that he is undoubtedly good at explaining his arguments. This book did a good job at disseminating a set of fundamental ideas from a physics perspective in relation to some very philosophical and mathematical issues. From my reading, there are two streams of ideas in the book. The first one is from mathematics, including the introduction of algorithms, Turing machines and logical proof systems. The second one is from physics, from classical mechanics to relativity and quantum mechanics and beyond. The interaction of these two streams by itself is worth reading by anyone who is pondering on the fundamental doubts of the mind, intelligence and conciousness.

From the first stream, the book’s main argument rests on the Turing halting problem and Gödel’s incompleteness theorems. From these theorems, he argues that machines could not be like humans since it could not know the truthness of these self-referencing statements. I am not yet convinced by this seemingly sound argument, because it rests on the fact that there is certain statement about the system itself that it could not know true or false. We humans could perceive that these incomplete statements are true, because we are not these systems therefore they are not self-referencing statements for ourselves. We do not have an answer to whether we ourselves are free from these incomplete limitations, since if we had the answer it would violate the incompleteness theorems. Who knows, maybe some aliens would think of us as no difference from we think of the machines, and apply a form of Cantor’s diagonalization to say that “look, humans cannot have mind because they cannot understand these true statements that are obvious to us”! As a result, the presumption that humans are free from incompleteness is one most ridiculous hidden idea in the book.

In the second stream, the book became much more constructive. It is a great journey to explore the searching of an explanation for the mind through the vast space of knowledge in physics. However, throughout the arguments, the ideas could only belong to a set of speculations. This is not a surprise since he argues for the necessity of a correct quantum gravity (CQG) theory to explain the human mind, which should ultimately unify quantum mechanics and general relativity under a single mathematical framework. It is the fact that no such theory yet exists that shakes down many of his arguments and made them merely speculations. As a result, this book in my opinion does a very bad job at opposing artificial intelligence in both streams.

In general, the book is still very much enjoyable just because it contains a grand set of fundamental knowledge. It is particularly so reading from a critic point of view. Roger Penrose also has two later books in the same string of thought, which undoubtedly may explain his ideas better and may resolve some of this book’s issues. I am looking forward to reading them as valuable thought excercises, but may be after a few books from some other human endeavors.",6
Simon Manley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics","Worth reading, despite being less developed than the later work","This book reads like an early draft of Penrose's ""Shadows of the Mind."" The reader coming afresh to Penrose's ideas would be tempted to skip this earlier book and going straight to Shadows, where the ideas are much more fully developed. The interesting aspect of the earlier work, however, is to see how Penrose's thinking was evolving, purely along physical lines, before he teamed up with the medico and neuroscientist, Stuart Hameroff. It would be a mistake to skip this book, because it is far more readable than ""Shadows,"" the later work being so detailed and technical that many will simply give up on it.

The Emperor's New Mind concentrates on the limitations of formal mathematical logic {as implemented in a computer}, and how human consciousness can stretch past these limitations. Much of this argument is based on Godel's theorems about the limitations of formal systems of logic. Penrose concludes that Artificial Intelligence programs will never, no matter how far computer science develops, be able to produce the kind of conceptual understanding which is characteristic of human consciousness. In a metaphysical leap, he proposes that consciousness is an essentially quantum phenomenon. He gives the ""collapse of the wave-function,"" familiar from conventional interpretations of quantum mechanics, an enhanced status as a real physical effect, and proposes that it is mediated by some {not yet fully understood} effect in Quantum Gravity.

Granted that a conscious observer has featured prominently in discussions of the ""measurement problem"" from the very beginnings of quantum theory, and that no agreed position has emerged in nearly a century of debate, Penrose's proposal to make the collapse of the wave-function an objective process, and to tie consciousness to it, has more merit than the metaphysical flavour might at first suggest.",3
Tartarus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics",Interesting premise but takes a long time to get to the point,"The Emperor's New Mind is an interesting take on the concept of Artificial Intelligence. The basic premise is that, contrary to what AI supporters have been insisting for decades, the idea that any machine could somehow become capable of actual thinking is a completely unfounded concept based on flawed reasoning.

Penrose's main argument is that all computers must necessarily run according to algorithms. Even if someone could somehow construct a ""quantum computer"" (which is doubtful) this would still be operating in an algorithmic manner. The mind, on the other hand, operates non-algorithmically. As such, no computer nor any machine could ever hope to replicate a mind no matter how advanced said machine may be.
Of course, this is a rather simplified overview of Penrose's argument. To get a better idea of the points he makes, one can do no better than read the book, where the arguments are presented in a good and convincing way.

One criticism I have of the book is that it takes a LONG time to get to the point. In fact, despite being a book about why ""strong AI"" is implausible, most of the book seems to be about mathematics and theoretical physics. Granted, maths and physics does tie in to Penrose's arguments against ""strong AI"", but he seems to go into excessive detail. Surely just a brief overview of the maths and physics underlying his arguments would have been sufficient.
As a consequence of all the detail put into all the maths and physics info, the actual arguments about AI don't go into nearly as much detail as they could. This is unfortunate, as I had been hoping for a more detailed set of arguments showing the flaws of ""strong AI"" claims. Still, what was presented was still pretty well argued.

Overall, an interesting book and a good source of info for understanding why claims about thinking machines don't hold up even close to as well as the claims' proponents would try to have one believe.",2
Rob Kroese,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics",An engaging tour that doesn't really go anywhere,"Disappointing. Penrose spends an insane amount of time talking about mathematics, turing machines, physics (classical and quantum), and all kinds of other stuff before finally settling down on page 376 to talk a little about brains. (I'll admit to skimming much of the preceding stuff.) After a brief tour of brain biology, we get to the crux of his argument, which boils down to the fact that it's hard to imagine how any algorithmic process could produce what appears to be non-algorithmic thinking. ""Thus we are driven to the conclusion that the algorithm that mathematicians actually use to decide mathematical truth is so complicated or obscure that its very validity can never be known to us. But this flies in the face of what mathematics is all about!""

This is a little like arguing that a man who wakes up at a bus station with no memory of how he got there must have been transported there by magic, because he has no memory or evidence of having been on a bus. Just because you aren't aware of the mechanism by which you got somewhere, it does not follow that that mechanism was something completely outside of your normal understanding of how the universe works.

Not only is his argument flimsy; it's only tangentially related to the 300 pages of stuff you have to wade through to get there. My suggestion is to skim the book for stuff you find interesting but don't expect much in the way of a central thesis.",4

Frederick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics",A Revolutionary Idea,"Penrose uses Godel's Incompleteness Theorems to posit that conventional computers can never replace animal brains (artificial intelligence).

limelight,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics",Exhausting,"If you could only use one word to describe this book, ""Exhausting"" would certainly be it. While the basic premise is that consciousness cannot be the product of complex algorithms, Penrose spends the vast majority of the text thoroughly exploring every irrelevant aspect of physics and every nuanced, extraneous detail of our current understanding of the nature of the universe, while attempting to accomplish the task of presenting the material in a way that the average Joe can understand (Hint: if your text contains the phrase, ""Here, theta is the angle which the pair of points z and w subtend at the origin in the Argand plane"" then you have failed).

After extensively winding his way through everything from Turing machines, the big bang, general relativity, special relativity, complex numbers, natural numbers, irrational numbers, Fractals and the Mandelbrot set, Euclidean geometry, Fermat's last theorem, Gödel's theorem, recursively enumerable sets, non-recursive mathematics, Hamiltonian space, periodic tiling, quantum mechanics, P and NP completeness, the two-slit experiment, quantum spin, Riemann spheres, Lobachevskian space, the EPR paradox, Newton's laws of motion, Schrodinger's equations, quantum field theory, Galilean space-time, entropy, black holes, vector mathematics and vector fields, cosmology, time symmetry/asymmetry, Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, quantum gravity, Lorentz equations of motion, Minkowskian space time, Poincare motion, the tidal effect and many, many, many other subjects, the author finally spends a mere two chapters on the main topic.

When Penrose does get back to discussing consciousness, most of his arguments are philosophical and many of his conclusions are drawn from observations of his own perception, which is then used to reason out larger principles. Penrose attempts to apply the same methodology to his inquiries regarding psychology and consciousness that he is used to from his more usual areas of work, such as mathematics and theoretical physics, areas where progress is made by simply thinking about problems and conjuring solutions in your head. Even when he does make an appeal to actual experiment, he often comes to bizarre conclusions. For example, an experiment wherein an electrode is placed into a person's brain which causes them to not be aware that their skin was touched when the electrode is activated within a quarter of a second after someone touched them leads Penrose to conclude that the effect of the electrode is traveling backwards in time.

If you have a lot of time on your hands and you would like a thorough survey of the state of physics as it stood in the late-80s then this book is for you. If you are looking for a decent discussion of consciousness, the relevant contents of this book could be easily condensed to a rather uninteresting pamphlet.",67
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics",Just Read the Good Parts,"As other reviews have mentioned, Penrose attempts to demonstrate the impossibility of strong AI's thesis. In the end, Penrose presents two core arguments: (1) a well-reasoned, deductive, and logical proof based on Godel's incompleteness theorem, and (2) a complete conjecture about quantum gravity that has little to no supporting evidence.

Thus, please save yourself the time and just read chapters 1-4 and 9-10. The 225 pages that are chapters 5-8 give the background for Penrose's second argument. These pages are mostly filled with erudite, technical physics. The first four chapters, on the other hand, give an enlightening review of artificial intelligence and outline the mathematics needed to follow his first core argument.

Personally, I find both arguments unconvincing. Not being a mathematician, I won't embarass myself by trying to show why Godel's incompleteness thereom is not entirely appropriate for a discussion on artificial intelligence. As for the second argument, neither you nor I need worry; it is entirely useless.",11

Johnny,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics","Outdated Ideas, All Over the Map","I bought this book thinking that it was written for scientific non-experts. I was very wrong. I have a masters degree in electrical engineering, so I probably have more scientific background than most of the general public. Even so, I found Penrose's book to be almost impenetrable. The topics range from soup to nuts: classical physics; general relativity; quantum mechanics; Mandelbrot sets and fractals; thermodynamics; cosmology and the big bang; computer science; physiology of the brain. Every so often, Schrodinger's wave function and black holes are thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately, these diverse topics are never brought together into a coherent thesis.

Furthermore, I found many of the ideas presented in this book as being outdated and incorrect. Examples of some of the egregious errors I found in the book include the statement that black holes destroy information and that entropy equals missing information. A more modern (and more technically correct) treatment of entropy and information can be found in ""A Farewell to Entropy"" by Arieh Ben-Naim, and Stephen Hawking changed his mind about black holes -- they don't destroy information.

Penrose makes the claim that the second law of thermodynamics is a consequence of quantum gravity. A more modern (and correct) view is exactly the reverse. As Erik Verlinde has shown, gravity is an entropic force that emerges from the second law.

Penrose repeatedly reverts to a very outdated reductionist description of reality, which assumes that the whole is equal to the sum of its parts; i.e., physical systems are linear superpositions of complex quantum-mechanical wave functions. The Schrodinger's Cat ""paradox"" is resurrected for the upteenth time, even though there really is no paradox. (I thought the tired notion of a quantum-mechanical cat that is simultaneously dead and alive had been finally laid to rest decades ago.)

It came as no surprise when Penrose articulated the reductionist evaluation of the human brain: ""In fact, there are a lot of similarities between the action of a great number of interconnected neurons and the wires and logic gates ... It would not be hard, in principle, to set up a a computer simulation of the action of a given such system of neurons. The brain is a thinking machine, no different than with consciousness an algorithm that is carried out by electrical impulses transmitted among neurons. A natural question arises: does this not mean that whatever the detailed wiring of the brain may be, it can always be modelled by the action of a computer?"" In other words, is the whole (the brain) equal to the sum of its parts (the neurons)? Is consciousness nothing more than a computer algorithm carried out by cellular logic gates?

Penrose brought the quantum-mechanical processes, U and R, into the discussion of consciousness. (Along with Schrodinger's Cat, U and R are repeatedly dragged into practically every topic in this book. U represents the linear, deterministic superposition of complex quantum wave functions and R represents the reduction, or ""collapse"", of the wave function into real, probabilistic actualities. Penrose states that in addition to causing the second law of thermodynamics, gravity, specifically the graviton particle, is responsible for triggering the R process.) After some hand-waving, Penrose concludes that even U and R are not up to the task of explaining consciousness, and therefore something ""beyond"" quantum mechanics is required to explain it. But what is ""beyond"" QM? Unfortunately, the book leaves that question unanswered.",4

Un francais en angleterre,3.0 out of 5 stars,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence),"Ok, but not enlightening","I own an old edition of the classic Russell and Norvig (R&N) which I read 10 years ago and did not feel like going through the huge new 2009 edition to learn about current topics, so I went looking for something a bit more recent with a focus on knowledge representation, and came up with this book. I have to say unfortunately that while not a bad book, it does not cover much more than the old R&N (side note on this: R&N is very comprehensive and covers the full AI spectrum. This book seems biased toward one particular school of AI. This may or may not be bad for you: if you're not interested in the additional material in R&N, such as neural nets, you're possibly better off with this book. I doubt there are many of you in this case though) and tends to be less pedagogical. It is also more uneven regarding the depth at which topics are covered, with a fairly strong bias toward the topics where the authors appear to be active researcher. Such a bias would be ok for a more advanced textbook, but we're talking about a fairly introductory text here, and it feels a bit unbalanced. I cannot therefore recommend it highly, but I am not highly critical either, as I still managed to learn a couple of things. Below are detailed notes, which I hope might be of interest to outline the stronger points. As a side note, this is a very theoretical book, with no direct programming application or exercises. This did not bother may, but may not be clear from the other reviews.

The introduction sets the scene well and provides a useful conceptual background. How the following chapters are articulated against the principles discussed in the introduction is not always straightforwardly clear though. In that sense, the authors may fall a bit short of their overall goal.

The second chapter (the language of first order logic) is unlikely to be big news for anybody schooled in undergraduate mathematics, but I understand the material must be included for the sake of completeness and autonomy. The third chapter is entitled ""expressing knowledge"" and in my view does not really do justice to the topic, as demonstrated by the matter covered in the afterthought section ""other sorts of facts"": these ""other facts"" include statistical and probabilistic facts, default and prototypical facts, intentional facts (beliefs etc...). The book deals with some of these later to be fair.

At this point in the book, all that has been achieved is to show how one can use first order logic (FOL) to deal logically with some problems that a six years old can probably solve without the need for the framework. Chapter 4 shows that it is possible to teach FOL to a computer and to have him assess the truth of a statement formulated in FOL given a number of others FOL statements. The algorithm is not completely trivial but not overly complex either. Unfortunately, the time taken to deal with such tasks is potentially very large for problems not amazingly complex if one allows FOL statements of arbitrary structured. Chapter 5 is dedicated to the exploration of Horn clauses, which are basically a type of FOL statement for which algorithms are available that converge faster. This motivates the need to embed some hints on how to reason with a given problem within computer languages. Chapters 6 and 7 explore this respectively in the context of PROLOG and of the so-called ""production rules systems"". As one gets familiar with the above approaches, a number of limitations become clear and the subsequent chapters are about moving away somewhat from FOL. Chapter 8 introduces object oriented representation, using a formalism a bit on the heavy side for a concept that's actually fairly clear. Give or take a few examples, a reader of R&N is on familiar ground up to this point in the book. The next chapters, respectively on description logics and inheritance cover material that was less familiar to me and might be a reason to dig into this book. It shows a couple of neat ideas (taxonomies, inheritance networks) and how reasoning with such data structures can be difficult when one encounters contradictions. This motivates the need to clarify the concept of ""default"", which is done in chapter 11, another good chapter in my view. Chapter 12 includes an introduction to probabilities that probably ranks with chapter 2 as something most readers don't really need. It also covers fairly superficially bayesian networks, influence diagrams and the Dempster Shafer theory. In all honesty given the brisk pace at which this is all done, I don't think it's really possible to get much out of what's covered here.

The concepts in the next chapter (Explanation and Diagnostic) were newer to me. While not straigthforward to implement, it seems the core approach of the authors is here at an advantage over other more opaque techniques.

The next two chapters (""Actions"" and ""Planning"") deal with topics that are closer to the preoccupation of standard AI. As they're both good topics to motivate the AI endeavour, introducing them earlier might have made more sense.

The last chapter is about ""the tradeoff between expressiveness and tractability"". The authors look back at the big picture that had been evoked during the introduction, but which had to some extent taken the back seat during most of the time. Fairly uncontroversially, they point out that being able to deal with very expressive languages is desirable, but typically fraught with tractability issues. One senses that the

It's highly readable though, requiring no technical knowledge, and one of those titles (like Dawkins' Selfish Gene) that makes the reader feel like a genius as the layers unfold. It focuses on the details of making a single individual as sophisticated as possible rather than the approach taken by most comparable researchers, who hook together 'creatures' driven by a few simple rules, apply those to a large population and let 'emergent' processes do the rest and generate complex outcomes. It's true - looking at ants in the real world, and various a-life programs created, you do indeed get interesting and unforeseen complexities from a large population of super simple organisms. But every increase in the sophistication of the individual creatures will have exponential benefits in how rich the outcomes will be from a population of them!

When integrating physics and math with biology, the hypotheses you can examine depend on the sophistication of the inputs.

I bought this book since this book has been referenced in another book : Demand Driven Performance by Debra & Chad Smith.

We understand earth by the guidance of physics. After Galileo - Copernicus - ... a huge step has been done by Newton.
Newton's Laws were explaining static, linear and dead bodies which are in equilibrum. called inertia. It means if there is no external force applied the mass keeps its course of movement, if it is still, it stays still, if it moves with constant speed it keeps going with the same speed. If you want to accelerate something, you need to apply a force. Everything is additive, optimization is possible. Time flows slowly, days are almost recurring, mass production is popular. World social and economic order is simply based on these principles.

Thermodynamics Laws are contradicting with Newton's Laws. You can break a glass easily but you can not make it again so easy. It means everything is not bidirectional and additive as Newton thinks. 2nd law of thermodynamics is known as entropy and it says everything is decaying, disorder is rising.

Darwin called this phenomenon as ""natural selection"", according to him only those organisms WHO are able to adopt changing circumstances will survive.

Einstein - Heizenberg - Bohr - ... inserted relativity, indeterminancy and proven that around light speed Newton's Laws are no more valid.

In this book I observe the evolution of dissipative structure concept by Ilya Prigogine to Complex Adaptive Sytems by John Holland. Characteristics and definition of CAS is exciting. I have been inspired several times by TOC concepts. I have found a lot of ties in between Deman Driven Performance and this book, it amazed me really.

This is a theory for nonlinear and living World, complying with Darwin, complying with entropy. Organisms and companies are able to learn, eager to survive and time has only one direction to go. Since everything is dynamic, everything is changing there must be no end point, no optimum point but continuous improvement. This is a must to survive against Darwin.

You need to know the rules to play chess. Even in this case every move leads endless new risks and opportunities, all possible mistakes are there waiting for you. This book is hinting the rules, the rest relies on you, practise and enjoy your life, enjoy your work !",3

For those unfamiliar with the bootstrap method, by a system of resampling from an existing sample of data it provides a means of establishing the standard error for pretty-near any statistical measure (like the standard error of the mean in traditional statistics), as well as the determination of general confidence intervals for those measures, even when the distribution of the data is non-gaussian or unknown. I do find the author's symbolic notation a bit confusing - perhaps TOO compact, and many of the symbolic expressions would really benefit from an associated clearly written paraphrasing (difficult for me to remember all the conventions after putting the book down for a few days).

Clifford Berg,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Artilect War: Cosmists Vs. Terrans: A Bitter Controversy Concerning Whether Humanity Should Build Godlike Massively Intelligent Machines,"Brilliant, and a timely call to attention","The book is not perfect. I think that in many ways De Garis glosses over complexities that might have a big impact. For example, he does not address the fact that the emergence of intelligent machines will not be the only crisis of technology that humans will be dealing with that threaten our survival: we will also have biotech, nanotech, and who knows what else. De Garis does mention these, but not in the context of how these competing issues might impact public policy and perhaps tip the balance in favor of the ""terrans"", as De Garis terms them.

De Garis also makes some large leaps in the book that are probably sound but that are not substantiated. For example, he mentions ""asteroid-sized"" artilects without explaining how or why this scale of machine would be built. Presumably he bases it on the argument that once the machines take over they will escalate their own scale - but he doesn't make this clear and the reader might be put off by descriptions of asteroid-sized machines, when in fact this is not really relevant to the main issue. The main issue is whether to allow the creation of machines that are smarter than us.

But De Garis is right that there is a fundamental issue that is independent of the details: if we can and do create such machines, we will surely lose all control over our destiny - to the extent that we have control now.

I also agree that De Garis is right that this is an emerging issue and perhaps the most important issue of the 21st century, if one expands the issue to the larger issue of oversight of technology in general.

The are many complex social issues that need to be addressed if one is to plan for how to implement oversight over technology, and De Garis does not get into this at all. A book (or many) is needed on this topic. De Garis says clearly that his goal is not to create such a plan but rather to raise awareness of the issues and stimulate debate.

I am very glad that I read the book because in spite of the leaps it is grounded I believe, although it might seem far-fetched to someone who has not thought much about these issues before. I think that De Garis' framework for thinking about the issues is effective. I strongly recommend the book.

D. Wolf,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Artilect War: Cosmists Vs. Terrans: A Bitter Controversy Concerning Whether Humanity Should Build Godlike Massively Intelligent Machines,"Overblown, maybe. Or maybe not.","The author argues that one day soon, humanity will divide into two warring camps: those who favor the development of superintelligent computers (which he calls Artilects--short for artificial intellects) and the humans who oppose this development. His thesis is that the opposers will so strongly fear the possibility that the artilects will exterminate humans that they will do anything to prevent their development--even waging all-out war against the humans who favor their development. He asserts that the result of this war will be nearly a total annihilation of humanity. The book takes up all manner of counterarguments and bats them down. The oddity is that the author claims to be a developer of these artilects who is genuinely conflicted about which camp he should belong in. Yet he can't bring himself to suppress the inventions he is working on that will help bring about the catastrophe he predicts. So rather than stop the work, he writes the book as a form of penance: ""Stop me before my science runs amok and kills off our species--but if you don't, I'm having a wonderful time stroking my ego as one of the foremost cybernetic thinkers and doers of our time--which may well be the end-times of our species!"" One argument he doesn't deal with is what happens if nobody pays much attention to the development of artilects--which, after all, won't just be sitting around philosophizing: they'll be put to work running our air traffic system, our energy grid, and all manner of other vital functions. By the time the potential enemies of the artilects take their eyes off Britney and other pop-culture distractions, it will be too late to stop the artilect supporters or the artilects themselves. At that point, we will just have to hope the artilects are sufficiently amused by our antics not to exterminate us. This, by the way, would be before they build themselves some space vehicles and depart on an exploration of the universe, where they'll find a way to tap into the power supplies of many different suns, so they won't be dependent on any one solar system for their survival--thus achieving immortality.",5
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Artilect War: Cosmists Vs. Terrans: A Bitter Controversy Concerning Whether Humanity Should Build Godlike Massively Intelligent Machines,Farfetched,"If one examines the history of research into artificial intelligence (AI), one will see it to be one of periods of incredible optimism as well as periods of extreme pessimism. Funding for research into AI, both private and public, is partly responsible for this. But the researchers themselves bear a certain measure of responsibility for the wild swings that have marked the history of AI. It seems that as soon as something is invented that appears promising or ""intelligent"" it is shortly thereafter abandoned as being ""trivial"" or uninteresting. Researchers always seem willing to go along with this unfortunately, even though they have indeed made significant progress in certain areas. Once an algorithm or reasoning pattern is understood, its status as `intelligent' is taken away and it is thereafter viewed as `just another part of the programming toolbox'. There is strong evidence, coming mostly from the commercial realm, that truly intelligent machines exist and are saving and making companies hundreds of millions of dollars in their deployment in the field. This intelligence is however not noticed or recognized as such. It is viewed merely as software that is `running' on the machines, complex yes, but not really different than `ordinary' software that has been used for decades now. If this pattern continues, then no matter how intelligent machines get they will not be viewed as being so. Their human users will therefore not be intimidated by or even impressed by them. They will become accepted just like any other piece of technology, usually taken for granted, although at times becoming an annoyance due to their need for repair and adjustment (this need becoming more critical as their complexity increases).

When this book is read with this in mind its main thesis, namely that there will sometime in the relatively near future be a controversy over the building of `massively' intelligent machines, completely dissolves. The author believes that sometime in the second half of the twenty-first century, humanity will divide itself into two camps. One of these, called the `Cosmists', will advocate the building of what the author calls `artilects', which are ""massively"" intelligent machines. The other camp, called the `Terrans', is strongly opposed to the building of these types of machines. The tension between these two groups will become so extreme the author argues, that it will result in a full-scale war between them, resulting in the deaths of millions of people.

In the book the author details his reasons for believing that this will happen, and he even discusses his own anxieties on the possibility of massively intelligent machines. The author is a noted expert in machine intelligence, especially in the fields of evolutionary computing and evolvable hardware. Therefore when a researcher like the author makes the claims he does it motivates the reader to examine his arguments in more detail. It is apparent when reading the book that these arguments have been carefully thought out, even though at times, because of the Cosmist-Terran terminology, the reading sometimes appears sophomoric or science-fictional in quality.

The claims made in this book would have more credibility if progress in artificial intelligence could be modeled by large discrete jumps. Central to its claim is that there will arrive a time at which both `Cosmists' and `Terrans' agree that superintelligent machines can be realized or manufactured. The apprehension felt by the Terrans will motivate them to try and suppress this realization, this behavior putting them squarely against the Cosmists. This conflict will escalate into full-scale war, fought with highly advanced and destructive technology.

But progress in AI is basically a smooth function of time, and there has been progress, despite the extreme skepticism of many individuals (most of these, again, being AI researchers themselves). Like any other field, some of the ideas in AI have not been fruitful, and have fallen by the wayside. Advances in AI have been steady, and the advances, as well as its applications are rapidly accelerating. The use of intelligent machines has become routine, so routine in fact that it is not really noticed. One can expect this trend to continue, and researchers twenty years from now will no doubt think that real intelligence has not yet been achieved. The bar will then get raised again. All the while the machines are performing useful functions and will exist in complete symbiosis with the humans around them. However, there will still be anxiety about the future arrival of superintelligent machines. It may take a while, probably till the end of the twenty-first century, for this anxiety to alleviate. Historians of technology in the first year of the twenty-second century will no doubt look back at this one and be perplexed as to why AI progress was not really part of the consciousness of those who were involved in it. These same historians will also feel another emotion when they study the developments of twenty-first century technology, including artificial intelligence:

I have a general methodology for reading texts or reference texts. First, a quick read through. Next a read through with note taking.

I bought this text because I am taking a college course in Discrete Structures this Fall, 2011, for my major in Computer Science. The course has no assigned text per se. Hence, the need for a comprehensive text to scare the bejeebers out of me, and get a good, solid grasp of what the topic encompasses. This text definitely does both.

This text is considered a one-semester course. It covers basic Number Theory, Probability and Statistics, Cryptography and Cryptanalysis, and much more.

Since it includes theory as well as practical exercises for the student, and requires the student to prove some of the theorems, it might be classified as an upper division text for the undergraduate student after completion of a course in mathematical proofs or similar.

Regardless, this text challenges me to learn beyond my comfort zone. Yes, it is intimidating. Yes, some of the material is beyond my current training and exposure. And, definitely, YES, I will learn more each time I read and study through it.

As I am always looking for texts to become a permanent addition to my library, this text definitely qualifies for permanent status. It will sit very nicely next to my:""The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes 1-4A Boxed Set, Donald Knuth"".

I believe this text deserves closer examination as a course text or reference text for your library.

JoLo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lessons from the Masters: Current Concepts in Astronomical Image Processing (The Patrick Moore Practical Astronomy Series),Current Concepts In AIP A Must Have,"For anyone wishing to improve their astrophotography skills this book is excellent. I do not recommend it for those just starting out in astrophotography - there are other getting started books and guides out there - but for those who have invested the time and effort in AP and are moving up the learning curve, this book is an excellent resource.

The book is divided into chapters written by some of the top names in astrophotography - Tony Hallas, Robert Gendler, Ken Crawford, Jay GaBany, Babek Tafreshi and many others. The chapters concentrate on a single process or workflow, many of which inlcude step-by-step instructions for incorporating these techniques into your workflow. There are three chapters that outline an overall deepsky workflow that I found very helpful. Hallas' short chapter on noise reduction and his technique used to remove green pixels from the background was by itself worth the price of the book. Ken Crawford on HDR and PS mask refinement, Tafreshi's chapter on incorporating earth and sky, sections on wide field processing, color enhancement, the list goes on...

If there was one disappointment with the book, i would say it was Damian Peach on planetary / lunar photography. I was really looking forward to the chapter to improve my processing skills on these challenging objects, using my video camera and Registax. I found the chapter to be useless and very basic. It did not contain any tips or step by step techniques like the other chapters that i found to be so useful - it really didn't tell me anything I didn't already glean from the web and the astronomy forums.

Sure, much of the information is available in online tutorials by Ken Crawford and DVDs by Adam Block and Tony Hallas, but one thing I really like about this book is having it all in one place (in my case the Kindle version on my iPad).

As well as demonstrating image processing methods within the book, the author also explains the whys and how's of undertaking various methods. I was amazed on the information provided by the masters as this information is difficult to extract from the experts. Thanks for putting this book together. I think I will be able to really improve my processing and also help and explain tips to other imagers. Definitely glad I got this one....",1
Jim Lafferty,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lessons from the Masters: Current Concepts in Astronomical Image Processing (The Patrick Moore Practical Astronomy Series),At Last!,"I purchased the kindle version of this book as soon as it was avaialble. After reading it over for the first time, I immediately ordered a print copy so I could keep one (printed) copy in the field with me and a second copy on my Ipad to refer to while processing my astro images. I am primarily a solar imager, but I did do deep sky ccd imaging for about 8 years with pretty high end equipment, and now I also have begun to delve into widefield DSLR imaging of the night sky. This book is exactly what most of us have been waiting for, especially that ""intemediate"" level imager who is looking for the information and tips to push on to the next level. All of the contributors to the book are recognized experts in their particular area of asto-imaging. Most of us in the hobby know them from their published images, their presentations at various amateur astronomy events, or have met/corresponded with them via social media. FINALLY, much of what they have learned that got them to the next level is all together in this one book. You will see that there isn't one ""magic pill"" that all these experts use to process great images. While there all common threads in terms of data collection, calibration, etc., each one takes a slightly different approach to processing based on their experience and target. The book deals with both the ""how"" and the ""why"" of different processing techniques in the various chapters, but I was also pleased that there is still discussion on the best techniques of gathering data with your camera as well. You will have your favorite chapters that center around what and how you like to image, and the rest of the information is still there at your fingertips when you are ready to ""branch out."" If you are an astro-imager like me, who has been mostly self-taught through the school of hard knocks, nurtured along the way with some guidance from those who have been there before, this book will be an indispensable part of you ""learning library"".

David C. Lane,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intelligence,A very important read to understand the rise of the machine brain!,"Reviewed by Dr. Andrea Diem-Lane

While computer technology has no doubt become more progressive, the question remains whether we will one day have full-blown artificial intelligence. The idea that we can actually create a being that may have consciousness and far surpass our own intelligence is astounding, but the ramifications of such a creation, whether it be our saving grace or demise, are still unknown to us. Many argue that since an AI explosion is in the very near future and it can so radically transform our lives, we should be diligently addressing all topics related to AI.

The Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intelligence edited by Keith Frankish and William M. Ramsey does just that. The text explores many AI topics from a variety of angles, including computer and cognitive science perspectives and philosophical and ethics ones. Though the editors make a point that this “guide’s” main focus is comprehending the latest in AI research and the theoretical issues of that research, many of the essays are written by philosophers of the mind who raise important philosophical issues, such as are machines conscious and what do we mean by that, can they be programmed to be ethical, and what does the future hold in light of AI?

The text is broken up into four main sections: the foundations (an examination of AI accomplishments, research areas, and philosophical roots); architectures (an understanding of good old-fashion AI or GOFAI, connectionism and neural networks, embedded cognition, etc.); dimensions (an investigation of different dimensions of intelligence from learning to emotion to consciousness, etc.); and, lastly, extensions (highlighting the world of robotics, artificial life and the ethical aspects of AI). The 15 articles that make up these sections are “stand-alone pieces” with often overlapping material. For instance, John Searle’s famous Chinese Room argument is discussed in several of its articles.

In the beginning chapter, Stan Franklin walks the reader through the key moments in AI, including Alan Turing’s significant contributions and the offering of the Loebner Prize of 100,000 dollars to the first program able to pass the Turing Test (an award still waiting to be declared but I suspect it will be claimed in the very near future). We learn here that the reference “AI” was coined shortly after Turing in the 1950s by John McCarthy, who worked at Dartmouth at the time, but later at MIT and then Stanford. The author explores many fascinating events of AI history, including the moment machine learning was born with Arthur Samuel’s checker playing program, and the case of Deep Blue beating the chess champion Gary Kasparov and Watson defeating champions on the game Jeopardy. In poetic form, the writer declares that in the second decade of the 21st century AI is emerging out of an AI winter (with some progress being made) to an AI spring and maybe even an AI summer (with major accomplishments on their way).

Franklin’s article is followed by a couple of essays which explore the philosophical aspects of AI, asking the profound question what is it to have a mind and whether computers will possess them. The authors review noted philosophical positions within the field, including Daniel Dennett’s strong AI position that consciousness is substrate neutral and so computers modeled after the human brain can have awareness. This is challenged by Hubert Dreyfus’ critique that AI will not match human intelligence. Unlike computers, human’s thinking is non-algorithmic or rule orientated (a similar argument was made by Roger Penrose). Dreyfus asserts: “Our ability to understand the world and other people is a non-declarative type of know-how skill that is not amenable to GOFAI propositional codification. It is inarticulate, pre-conceptual, and has an indispensable phenomenological dimension that cannot be captured by any rule based system.”

Another objection to strong AI comes from John Searle. According to his weak AI position, there is no qualia for the computer as there is for the human mind. Computers, he says, simulate conscious understanding but do not have it. To demonstrate this Searle devised the Chinese Room thought experiment. Imagine you are in a closed room and trying to communicate in Chinese with one outside the room. To do so you slide under the door frame questions in Chinese. On the other side of the door the recipient slides the correct answers to the questions back to you. From your perspective you may think that you are communicating with a real Chinese speaker who understands Chinese, but in truth, according to this thought experiment, you are communicating with a computer which is simply manipulating syntactical symbols but not understanding their meaning or semantical content. In a similar vein, another thought experiment also mentioned in the reading is Ned Block’s “China brain” thought experiment. As a criticism of machine functionalism, in this thought experiment one is asked to imagine that the entire population of China acted like a human mind for 60 min. If functionalism is correct, then one would expect that if the human mind was simulated perfectly, with individual citizens acting as neurons connected in just the right way, then a conscious mind would emerge out of this. But, as Block points out, this is absurd.

Despite some philosophical objections that strong AI awaits our future, other articles investigate evidence for it and the amazing strides made in AI research. One such area is machine learning, perhaps one of “the most rapidly growing areas of computer science.” Another area of research is developing artificial agents that may be able to experience and express emotions. Though we face the “other minds problem” (that is, not being able to know the internal states of another or if there are internal states), we encounter the same problem for humans. If the “right kind of architecture” is implemented for emotion, as it is for the human brain, then there is no reason to argue conscious emotions cannot be experience in AI. If one takes a substrate independent view, then simulating the physics of the brain well enough can allow for consciousness and emotional states.

In one of the chapters in the last section of the book promising lines of research in robotics are investigated. For instance, interfacing technology with neural tissue may allow for prosthetics to be controlled by the brain. Perhaps even more fascinating is the possibility of creating hybrid machines, or robots with “biological matter in their control systems.” Whether digital electronics are put in our brains or whether some of our organic matter is place in the robot, future robotics, it is predicted, will become as common place as computers are on every desk.

Furthermore, artificial life research (hard artificial life of autonomous robots; wet artificial life of test tubes and creating artificial cells from living and non-living materials; and soft artificial life of computer simulations or digital constructions) is elucidated. Whether we can create life synthetically and whether software systems can be “alive” raises profound philosophical concerns. Creating such life forms places us in “unchartered ethical terrain.”

One of the most enlightening articles in the text that deals with the subject of ethics is Nick Bostrom’s and Eliezer Yudkowsky’s The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. The authors evaluate important ethical issues, such as preventing machines from harming humans and the world at large, and also considering the moral status of machines themselves. For AI to be built to act safely and ethically it needs to have “general” intelligence and not be simply task specific. Artificial General Intelligence (or AGI) will be able to “foresee the consequences of millions of different actions across domains.” Furthermore, to determine whether a machine should have moral status, we need to ask if the machine has both sentience (qualia) and sapience (or personhood). If these are established conceivably one should not discriminate morally against it. According to the Principle of Ontogeny Non-Discrimination, if two beings have the “same functionality and the same consciousness experience, and differ only in how they came into existence, then they have the same moral status.” We apply this reasoning to humans created in vitro fertilization and would presumably to humans if they were created as clones, and so reasonably we should likewise bring it into play when creating artificial cognitive systems.

In this same article there is a fascinating section on whole brain emulation, or “uploading” the human brain unto a digital computer. To do this one may have to destroy the original organic matter as it is dissected into thin slices in order to capture all of its neuronal connections. Once a precise three dimensional map of the brain is achieved then this can be uploaded to a powerful computer and the new digital brain may have consciousness as the old one did. Either this new brain can live in a virtual reality or be connected to a robotic body and live in the external world.

In this discussion, the writers raise the issue that artificial minds may experience subjective time very differently than we do. Four years of objective time to us may be experienced by a “fast AI” as a millennia of subjective time. The Principle of Subjective Rate of Time is introduced here: “In cases where the duration of an experience is of basic normative significance, it is the experience’s subjective duration that counts.” In this context, then, if a fast AI and a human were both in pain, it may be morally relevant to alleviate the pain the AI experiences before one helps the human. Or, in an another case, if an upload committed a crime and it was sentenced to two years in prison, we would have to ask if this should be two objective years (experienced subjectively as a very, very long time at the fast AI level) or two subjective years (for us just a couple of days).

Many of these same philosophical and ethical concerns are also addressed in Sam Harris’ podcast, The Light of the Mind, in which Harris interviews philosopher David Chalmers. In the last 40 minutes of the almost two hour podcast, the conversation turns to AI. Chalmers did his Ph.D. at an AI lab at Indiana University and so AI research has been a particular interest of his. While he has spent a great deal of his career as a philosopher on the hard problem of consciousness (subjective, first person states of awareness), more recently, he has focused his energy on whether AI can experience such an internal state. Known for taking a non-reductionistic view, Chalmers argues that consciousness cannot be explained by standard physical processes. He claims that something needs to be added to the picture, such as new properties or an enriched physics in a panpsychic way. With this view, some label him an “innocent dualist.” Nonetheless, he entertains that AI can have consciousness much like us.

Ultimately, Chalmers argues there are two ways AI research can go. In one scenario, we become these superintelligent creatures by enhancing and augmenting ourselves or uploading ourselves (via reverse engineering). Once we have cracked the neural code we can replace our brain with durable computer parts and perhaps a new artificial body as well. Wisely, Chalmers suggests a gradual upgrade, one neuron replaced by one silicon chip at a time, and that one stay awake during the procedure to ensure consciousness stays on route. If “lights start to go out” in the procedure then it can be stopped before it is too late. Supposing that it is successful, the question remains will this be “me” or simply a copy or twin type of me. When we ask the silicon beings if they are the original of course they may try to convince us they are but we would really have no way of knowing if this was the case.

If we want to live virtually with no “meat body” we can reverse engineer our brains and upload them onto computers. Yet, an obvious ethical question arises out of this: if you delete an uploaded self are you committing murder? Chalmers contends that if there is consciousness (or what appears to be) then this being is in our “moral circle of concern.” On a personal note, at the end of the interview, Chalmers expresses his hope that in his life time he will one day be able to upload himself. With this immortality may possibly be achieved.

In another storyline, according to Chalmers, superintelligent beings are not like us and these new superintelligence AI may destructively take over the world, gobbling up our resources and eliminating anything that stands in its way, as Nick Bostrom in Superintelligence also speculates. Since AI may have the ability to mass reproduce (making copies of themselves) and each successor system may be more intelligent than the prior one, these smarter minds may pose great risks to our overall well-being (of course, it is also possible that they offer great benefits). Sam Harris interjects that with their far superior intelligence they may trample us as we do an ant hill.

With all of this said, in a 100 years time when we may be in full blown “AI summer,” the world may seem unrecognizable to us. Superintelligent conscious machines, humans with silicon chip brains and robotic bodies or uploaded human consciousness, and even possibly teletransportation, may be the norm. Since the tide of AI is rising this is the time we should focus our efforts in setting up game rules and ethical standards, helping to create a friendly future before it is too late.",1
Christopher G. Rose,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intelligence,Frustrating Book,"This is a frustrating book. It has a copyright of 2014 but many of the articles (it is basically a collection of articles) seem hopelessly out of date. (I'm looking at you, GOFAI chapter, in particular.) There is a lot of philosophical noodling, some interesting, but mostly incomplete and way too confident. For example: There is much claiming that computer systems can't be intentional, but no specification of how a system might prove that, and no consideration that we would have a lot of trouble proving the intentionality of our human peers. Basically this is a lot of philosophers arguing about science in the same way that Aristotle did in his Physics. Aristotle got little right in the light of modern science, and I suspect the partisans of each school will eventually be shown to be poor predictors of the future scientific results. They seem to have missed out on the last 10 years in advances in machine translation, context sensitive understanding of language, and other technologies that have grown incredibly very recently. For my part, I am an engineer who works in the field. Some of the philosophy inspires ideas to implement. Most just make me shake my head at how easily people believe the weak ideas that they have based their careers around. Most should probably head back to grad school for a knowledge update,",8

Sunghyun Kim,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning LibGDX Game Development, Second Edition",starting with OpenGL ES and later finding LibGDX better choice to start with,"I am not a game software developer, but got myself interested in it recently,
starting with OpenGL ES and later finding LibGDX better choice to start with,
because LibGDX has OpenGL ES in it and it works as a game framework.

Author starts with very detailed guide on how to set up development environment, followed by
basic architecture and flow of LibGDX and then gives you an illustration of
developing a complete game with Canyon Bunny which I've found easy to understand.

In later part, the author touches upon a simple 3D application based on LibGDX
where the essential stuffs like ray picking and model-based rendering are explained.

All the example codes are downloadable from Packt Pub and all worked when I actually
executed them on Eclipse, except for the Android-based Canyon Bunny which crashed
on pressing play button, reason for which I am still trying to find.

( The reason : java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.badlogic.gdx.physics.box2d.World.

If this error ever occurs, copy gdx-box2d.jar from the libs folder of CanyonBunny project
to that of CanyonBunny-android project. Then it will work. )

In my case, this book worked as a good starting point after which I am moving onto Libgdx Cross-platform

this may not be what you're trying to find.",5
Joshua Davis,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning LibGDX Game Development, Second Edition",Kindle version has no images,"I don't usually write reviews but I am hoping I can save someone some trouble. I should start by saying that I think the content of the book looks like it should be good, but the Kindle version got screwed up. The authors make extensive use of screenshots and other graphics and none of them show up in the Kindle edition. It seems like every other page has a reference (not a link, just a heading/description) to an image that isn't there.

In the beginning of the book they mention that they provide a PDF that includes color images (I'm assuming the print edition has black and white images) but the link is broken. The link they give is here: https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/4775OS_ColoredImages.pdf but that results in a 404 (file not found) error and no way to find the file. I went to the packtpub.com website for the book and I couldn't find any reference to the color PDF there either.

A lot of the concentrated info contained here is hard to find elsewhere and would require extensive research in several compiler theory and computer architecture manuals.
After reading the text your understanding of software/hardware interface will be improved by several orders of magnitude.
The only small annoyance is the fact that a lot of times Mr Hyde start the discussions on various topics using HLA listings as example and even if he provide details on MASM/TASM applications he does so comparing these to HLA. Hence you have to always study the HLA examples ( HLA is some kind of low-level language the author developed ).
Since I'm not interested in HLA ( probably like a lot of the readers out there ) I did not like the ( small ) additional effort it required.
Overall this book is a little gem.",3
Lance C. Hibbeler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Write Great Code, Volume 2: Thinking Low-Level, Writing High-Level","Overall, totally worth it","I read the first volume of this book, and it was a great, informative read. After volume 2, I have this to say:

This book is not a cookbook for writing better code. Hyde explains why certain programming constructs are better than others (and in what cases), and backs it up with evidence from the assembly code (that is the entire premise of the book). Finally, solid proof of (and against) what I've been hearing all along from instructors and other programmers on message boards or face-to-face communication. That in mind, it would have been nice to have a summary of the tips at the end of the chapters, or the end of the book, as a quick-reference kind of thing. These concepts are the perfect thing to consider when fine-tuning your code. I take the stance that if you fine-tune as you go, you have less work later, so I took notes as I read and have started implementing changes for the better (with evidence that it is better) in some of my coding.

Does anyone write code in Pascal anymore? Seriously? Hyde discusses examples in C/C++ and Pascal for the most part (favoring Pascal, by my estimation), so it is nice that the book is language-independent for the reader. The assembly examples in the book are in 80x86 and PowerPC...I think it would have been better to release two versions of this book, one where the assembly is 80x86 (because it is so ubiquitous, if for no other reason), and then another where the assembly is in PowerPC assembly. I didn't pick this up to become an assembly language programmer, and quite frankly, the PowerPC examples just confused me. It looks like my cat stepped on my keyboard and it appeared in print.

The tone of the text is sometimes condescending (especially in the first 5-6 chapters), with a not-so-subtle ""real men only code in assembly"" message. It seriously reminds me of my parents/grandparents whining about how hard they had it growing up...walking barefoot to school in the winter...and only having assembly to work with in writing programs.

So by the end of this book, I think I have met Hyde's goal for the readers. I can't sit down and write an assembly program, but I can read enough assembly to compare different versions of my high-level program to say what is better. As the subtitle suggests, I am ""thinking low-level"" now as I write my programs (in C...which most programmers would call low-level). I suggest ""actively"" reading this book and coding up a few examples with your compiler and examining the output, following along in the text. Doing that really made the material click for me.

Overall, it's a good book and definitely worth it. This is a long one though, and takes some time to digest. See you in volume 3!",9
Wuping Xin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Write Great Code, Volume 2: Thinking Low-Level, Writing High-Level","do not ask what your compiler can do for you, but what you can do for your compiler!","In this RAD time when anybody who knows drag-and-drop can proudly claim himself software developer, this is the unique book for true, serious, and hardcore programmer that writes native codes. I completely agree that, in order to write efficient and optimized code, you not only need to understand what your compiler can do for you,but also you should know, at least for a minimum level, what you can do for you compiler. In this regard, this book does an excellent job explaining the magic your compiler does for you and what you can do to become part of the magic. As such, I highly recommend this book to any serious programmers.

The only thing I don't like about this book is that it appears to be giving too much space to HLA, which I suspect is a widely accepted assembly dialect that was actually used in any real-life project. And I just feel it is a waste of my time trying to understand and catch up with this HLA language. This results in my taking one star off with the final rate of 4 stars.

Other than that, this is indeed a very good book.

In a previous reivew, it is complained that Java is not touched. This is understandable while it really doesn't seem to be a problem to me. Java after compiling is translated into bytecode that has to be executed on the virtual machine. I guess that is really beyond the intended scope of this book, which is related to the world of native codes that after compiling can be directly executed by the machine.",8

Keto,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Engineers Guide to MATLAB (3rd Edition),Great title for mechanical and other engineering fields,"Many 'engineering' matlab books don't live up their titles. They are simply written as general introductions to matlab with a few useless thoughts about engineering thrown in.
In my opinion, a good matlab engineering book focuses less on general tips that you could get anywhere, and more on practical problem solving techniques and methodologies that provide insight into a paticular engineering problem and its solution.
This books succeeds in that respect. Though it gives space to the more general issues of using matlab, it gives ample room to specific engineering problems. I found its information and examples very useful. The topics are focused on mechanical engineering fields, such as vibration and control; however, the math used for such topics are used across engineering and science disciplines. Thus, any scientist or engineer will find this book useful.
The book is written so that engineers at many levels can benefit from it. For example, as a former graduate student, I found the treatments of vibration response analysis insightful. However, an undergraduate or otherwise inexperienced user would benefit from this book as well, because there is alot of general discussion of how to effectively and efficiently use matlab and write m-files.
All in all, I found this book excellent for both its treatment of high level engineering analysis issues and its more general matlab tips and discussion.",36

Retuning to the usual introductory concepts, after years of exerience, I found most of it to be ""old news"", but there were still some elementary functions that I was unaware of and coding techniques that together allow me to write shorter, more time-efficient, and more readable (to outsiders) code.

Chad P. Glinsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Engineers Guide to MATLAB (3rd Edition),Review of 3rd Edition,"********* 06/15/2011 UPDATE *********
Now that I've owned this book for over a year, I just wanted to say I still stand by my original comments (below) and still believe this is a 5 star book. Over the last year, this book has accelerated my ability to become proficient in MATLAB and it's NOT simply a copy and paste of the MATLAB help documentation. I particularly recommend this for Mechanical Engineering students.
*************************************

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I've owned the 3rd Edition of this book for about a week now. Therefore, it is difficult for me to give a truly complete review, but I have at least skimmed through the various chapters. This book looks amazing, even for someone with little to no training in MATLAB (like myself). It starts with the basics and quickly moves into the more advanced material without going into unnecessary details about computer programming. It explains how to use the tools you need and gets to the point quick.

I am a graduate student in mechanical engineering and I am very disappointed that a numerical analysis course that utilizes this book was not offered during my undergraduate years. I think it should be mandatory that every senior undergraduate mechanical engineering student fully understand how to utilize MATLAB for solving engineering problems...something that I lacked upon graduating, so now I'm making up for it on my own time with this superb book.

Bottom Line: This book makes the perfect companion for any engineering student interested in learning to solve real-world problems with MATLAB (a commonly used program in the real-world).

Thanks to the many authors of this book!",3

Sunday,4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Android Studio: Build Android Apps Quickly and Effectively,"A very good book, but needs some improvements","This book does a fantastic job describing Android Studio app development and supporting tools (Git, Gradle, ...). The coding projects it gives are really good, illustrating the essentials of app development. But, some of the most important android software classes that they use (e.g. Intents, Adapters, Broadcasts, Notifications, Transactions, etc) are hard to find, since they are not mentioned in either the Table of Contents or the sparse Index. If there is another edition of the book (I hope there is one), it could improve the Index, add also add a chapter discussing some important classes and methods in the SDK. This should be done before Chapter 7 about Git, where many of these classes are used without any description of them (e.g., Intents). This makes Chapter 7 particularly murky, and difficult to understand. Chapter 8 is clearer, with some discussion of android classes and methods. Then, in Chapters 9 and 10, there are a few good descriptions of android classes etal. For example, Intents are finally described near the end of Chapter 9; although, there is no reference to this in the Index. Also, what it means to inflate android Views is finally described near the start of Chapter 10, but again is not referenced in the Index. These descriptions are needed much earlier in the book, before they are actually used in the ""Labs"".

I would have given this book 5 stars, except for this lack of clarity, and lack of content referencing.",12
AstroArlo,2.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Android Studio: Build Android Apps Quickly and Effectively,Not suitable for beginning programmers,"If you have no experience programming, do not purchase this book thinking it will be easy to learn to program Android apps! I found that Murach's Android Programming was laid out much more logically and was easier to follow. Also, they slowly build up the complexity as you progress through the chapters. I used the first edition, which was oriented to programming in eclipse. The second edition includes Android Studio - I wished I had purchased that book instead of this one.

I purchased this book several weeks ago and some of the examples are already obsolete!

In chapter 5, the exercise is to build an application called Reminders. If you follow the instructions, an application is created with xml which looks nothing like the xml in the example code for the book which can be downloaded. The instructions say to create a new app. After creating the app, you are supposed to click on the ""Hello World"" text on the Visual Designer stage, delete it, and then drag a List_View onto the stage. However, Android Studio will not let you do this because the default xml created is considerably different than what is in the source code from the book.

I took two semesters of Java in college, and we programmed Android in the second semester. Without this background, I would have been completely lost for this example. I used eclipse to program in Java and Android, and purchased this book to become proficient in Android Studio. This book may get me there yet, but I need to make it through more chapters to see if it will fit that bill.

I agree with a previous reviewer about the use of git in this book. It is spread out over several chapters and I found some of the explanations very general and not too helpful in getting the tool running. Also, this seems like an advanced topic for people just learning how to program in Android. I think it would fit better later in the book.",1

My major issue is that a number of the examples (most?) had IDE warnings and when I got to chapter 9 (which is why I bought this particular book) it all fell apart.

Chapter 9: Currencies Lab: Part 1 is where they create the JSONParser class. As soon as I started importing any of the org.apache.http.* libraries Android Studio started complaining and thought I could eventually make it work (without any help on this from the book or its source files/errate from Apress) it still wasn't something that I would really want to use because Google has deprecated their usage.

Geoff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning Made Easy with R: A Gentle Introduction For Data Science,An excellent guide,"I actually really love this book. The quality of the grammar and spelling throughout is very poor (the book reads like it was written by a ten-year old) yet in many ways this is its greatest strength. Anyone who was given up on learning guides because the language and technical jargon used is unfathomable need not worry at all here. The writing is so straightforward that it makes learning the models a breeze.

My only criticism is that the book contains a lot of diagrams which were produced in R with no mention of the code that produced them, which is silly because in many cases its a one liner. It means you have to dig around on the internet to find out how to do it.

Overall though this is great and I find myself strangely compelled to read the author's other books.",4
ShoppingGeek,4.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Understanding (2nd Edition),Very good introduction,"Natural Language Understanding is a much better introduction to NLP/AI than Speech and Language Processing (2nd Edition). While some amount of jargon is to be expected, NLU keeps it to a relative minimum and is very readable.

I have been working on a knowledge base (""KB"") for NLP/NLU for many years and one shortcoming that I see in all books like this is that the authors do not seem to have any direct experience with creating a KB and as a result, they spend a lot of pages, and even chapters, trying to solve problems which are already solved by a good KB design. Many of the middle chapters, as well as the appendix on Logic, fall into this category.

Nevertheless, there is a lot of worthwhile material in this book. Even things which seem off-base to me still raise some issues which will require further thought and analysis. In comparison, I felt like I got nothing at all of value out of the 1000-page Speech and Language Processing book.",7

Joe P,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perl Best Practices: Standards and Styles for Developing Maintainable Code,A must-read for any Perl shop,"Perl is frequently criticized for being messy, hard to read, and unmaintainable... a complaint which is not without merit. Perl Best Practices is a direct response to that criticism, and goes a long way towards resolving those issues. Any team, or any individual for that matter, who is writing Perl code for a living should read this book and implement it's recommendations.

Perl is an extraordinarily flexible language, which by design puts as few constraints on the programmer as possible. This freedom lets it do amazing things, and is part of what makes Perl so powerful, but it is a double-edged sword. The fact that the language itself does not force you to conform to an arbitrary style of ""good"" programming means that the onus is on the programmer to be self-disciplined. Perl Best Practices (PBP) provides guidelines for that self-discipline, and the tool it inspired - perlcritic - provides an enforcement mechanism.",1
Frobisher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perl Best Practices: Standards and Styles for Developing Maintainable Code,Perl Salvation!,"I came to perl from a C++ background, and was initially horrified by the aspects of perl that control-freak-language developers usually are. However, after using it on and off for a couple of years it became my language of choice because it's so quick and easy to do things that just take too much coding in other languages. (As a friend of mine said who kept pushing me to get used to perl, ""Yes, Dave, perl *is* the dark side, but once you go there you'll never want to go back..."")

Being A Good Developer I have purchased a number of perl books, and several of those have been useful. The problem is that there's a tremendous amount to remember, especially if you're not coding 100% in perl, especially since encyclopediac reference books just don't have time for the 'why' aspect.

This book excels in a few important ways:

1) There's always a 'why' given, and the right way and the wrong way are contrasted. This makes it, for me, far easier to remember things. It helps that the author uses English very well, and I virtually never find myself wondering what he meant. (In too many programming books, there's just not enough editing of the explanations, and very poor English.)

2) While I don't always agree with the author's best practices, most of the time I do, and he always makes his case well.

3) He shows both 'before and after' code, and gets the amount of code needed to make the point exactly right. I almost never find myself flipping past over-long examples, nor do I find myself not getting things because he's too concise.

This book was both highly useful and a pleasure to read. (Perl is indeed the dark side, but now I revel in the dark side.)",2

But this book (Perl Best Practices) somehow pulled me in - and I ended up reading every page of it. Why? Because I was finding elegant ways of writing the code. Note that I was writing Perl scripts every day for the last 10 years. So you would think I don't need instruction. Still after reading the PBP book, I am now doing many things differently.

Damian compares different styles of writing the code, explains potential problems (sometimes very subtle and difficult to catch), and explains how to write the code which is more readable and maintainable.

Eric J. Wu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perl Best Practices: Standards and Styles for Developing Maintainable Code,This book has changed my life,"This is a must-read for any Perl programmer. You are only as good as the teachers you have, and if your teachers use stuff like $|++, you are screwed. In this case, Conway would tell you to Use English;, and then you'd know what a $| is. A sampling of other tips:

Don't modify via $_ (too easy to screw things up)
Use hashes for arguments if arguments > 3 (trackability)
Use Croak instead of die (Croak gives more info, better for debugging)
Use ' ' instead of "" "" when no interpolation (less ambiguity)
Don't use unless (complication and confusion).
use /xms in regexes (for readability, and avoiding mistakes)
test when closing or opening a file

A few of the reviews here are 1 star. IMO these are people to which ""freedom"" is more important than ""group code maintainability"". This should really be the third Perl book for anybody, after Learning Perl and Intermediate Perl.

George Roman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perl Best Practices: Standards and Styles for Developing Maintainable Code,Don't Write Code Without It,"This is a fantastic book that's valuable no matter what language you

program in. I've been writing code for three decades and have

programmed in almost two dozen languages and the priorities are always

the same when writing / reviewing code: maintainability, efficiency and

robustness. Every dictum in this book clearly advances one or more of

these priorities. If you're like me, you'll wish you had this book when

you started your software engineering career.

For development teams, this book is an instant win. With any

development team, there is always a discussion as to what coding

standards to use. Perl BP can be used to short-circuit such debate, to

the benefit of everyone involved.

Of course, not everyone will be happy with the standards outlined in the

book. Before I plunged in, I skimmed through the book and found things

that I disagreed with: K&R braces; loop labeling; no unless statements;

postfix if; etc. The arguments made in the book, however, are so

compelling that I'm now gladly writing my code to conform with them.

I always feel fortunate when I read a book that makes me want to change

my behavior for the better. Perl BP is one of these books.",3
David Gaj,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perl Best Practices: Standards and Styles for Developing Maintainable Code,Extremely Useful and Informational Book!,"This book contains a tremendous amount of information that will help make you (and me) a better Perl programmer. Obviously, there are many ways to do things in Perl, but it does help to have a guide to show the different ways and why one way might be better than another - as far as maintenance, readability, etc.

For Perl to be taken more seriously as a structured, modular, maintainable language, we need to start using more discipline in implementing style suggestions such as those contained in this book.

PBP tells you how to write good Perl until you have enough experience to know better. Then you'll write Perl like the book suggests because you do know better.

PBP is like ""use strict"". At first using each seems overbearing and painful, after awhile you wonder how you endured the pain of not using them.

PBP describes programming habits that, if followed, will make your programming time more productive. It will also make it more enjoyable, unless you actually like beating your head against the wall searching for self-introduced bugs.",9

one. I didn't understand why there is no info on Win32 Perl (use

""chomp"" instead of ""chop"", stuff like that). The book would have been

better if it hadn't shied away from that. It seems like Conway

decided to leave OS-specific best practices for another book. Apart

from that one gripe the book is quite good and will force the reader

to think about ways to improve his programming even though no one will

agree with everything. The books strongest point is that it touches

on the oldest parts of the language and also some really new stuff

like importing Perl 6 behavior via CPAN modules, and ties it all

together into a coherent body of thought. The thing that really

shines is how much Conway understands how Perl works as a programming

language and is honest about where it's lacking. Apart from the

The chapters are well written and provide good examples for any significant concepts. Each section covers the basics to establish a foundation of understanding for someone unfamiliar with the area, but goes on to also touch upon the research forefront on each topic. One of the most useful sections I've found as a researcher is the Bibliographic Notes found at the end of each section which briefly describes the major groups of work within the topic with cites to major papers/articles/books in each of these areas (seems to be about 50 or so per chapter).

The only ""drawback"" to this book would be if you wanted to touch upon everything, there is far too much content for a single semester. However as mentioned above, the chapters are structured such that you could easily use the first couple sections of each chapter to cover all the foundations and either leave later sections for students to read on their own/select an advanced project, or cover the remainder in a 2nd semester.

A. Williams,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Unity Scripting,Here are some of the things I liked about this book… + Contains good information on Unity ...,"I have mixed feelings about this book. About half way through, I was ready to give it 5 stars. But my opinion changed while reading the 2nd half. It seems as though the author was trying to write a book that beginners and advanced coders could benefit from, and in the process, created one that isn’t ideal for either.

Here are some of the things I liked about this book…

+ Contains good information on Unity programming concepts like GameObjects, events, integration with Git, etc.
+ Debugging section was great (I learned a lot from it)
+ Contains good information on improving code quality and efficiency.

And here are some of the things that I thought could have been better …

- The books states it is an advanced book intended for people already familiar with Unity scripting, yet the 1st 50 pages are a review of basic C# and general OO principles. Those pages do contain some Unity specifics, so readers familiar with C# still need to go through it. I would prefer to separate the generic from the Unity specific, or remove the generic altogether and assume C# as a prerequisite.
- The book seemed to change from a “guide” in the first half to more of a “cookbook” in the second half. Latter chapters appear to be a collection of “how tos” for certain things, with explanations not much more than comments about the code.

Overall it was still a good read and I learned a lot, so I gave it 3* because there was no 3 1/2 star rating. For anyone wanting to get a good understanding of how Unity animations work, however, the author’s book “Unity Animation Essentials” is a 5* read.",5

JoeT,4.0 out of 5 stars,RapidMiner: Data Mining Use Cases and Business Analytics Applications (Chapman & Hall/CRC Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Series),"Excellent, but…..","Rapidminer is a great tool, but to me, suffered from abysmal documentation.
So, when Matthew North came out with ""Data Mining for the Masses"", I was both happy (great explanations in all the chapters) and hoping that he would release a second version of his book. So far, no.
Instead, this book was published. It is edited by Markus Hofmann, and contains 24-chapters which were cobbled together from outside sources. So, I was expecting something similar to North's book.
Not quite.

Pros:
1. 24 (actually 23 if you don't count the introductory chapter) fairly detailed use cases for a number of different projects.
2. All of the processes can be found on the rapidminerbook.com site.
3. Advanced use of Rapidminer. Personally, I think a bit of overkill for beginners but experienced uses will love the examples.

Cons:
1. The book to me is a series of 23-use cases. They define the problem and offer the process diagram then stop. Most of the chapters do not even discuss what happens if you execute the process and explain how to interpret the results. This is what is significantly different from North, and if you are using a process that you are unfamiliar with, isn't a good thing.
2. The editor was lazy. Instead of creating 1-zip file with all the processes in it, labeled by chapter, there are 24-different files to download from the website. And, some are labeled ""Chapter 12"" or something altogether different.
3. Some of the data files that the processes seem to need are missing and I have had difficulty in getting the same results on some of the processes. One of the processes is just plain wrong (it's right in the book though), and Chapter 17…still can't get it to work.

Summary:
This book does quite a nice job in the ""define and design"" part of creating a process. I can't imagine that anyone taking the time to work through the examples will not learn something. However, I caution a beginner using Rapidminer: this book might be a bit of overkill as a first book. You would best use North's book first, get some experience, then go through this book, since the 'analysis' component of this book is missing from most of the chapters.",12
Mehul Shah,5.0 out of 5 stars,RapidMiner: Data Mining Use Cases and Business Analytics Applications (Chapman & Hall/CRC Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Series),Wonderful Case Studies!,"Wow, this is truly a great book. The 20+ case studies in this book are stupendous in breadth and scope spawning numerous domains; retail, healthcare and pharmaceutical to name a few. RapidMiner is well known for providing a data-mining platform that makes data-mining accessible to everyone, including those not blessed with having gone through the rigors of a PhD in knowledge discovery.

This book provides the much needed impetus to jumpstart serious data-mining initiatives by first systematically dissecting the challenges and hurdles to data-mining in the real world and subsequently providing fully operational RapidMiner solutions a.k.a. processes to tame the challenges. Solutions are also provided for the much more difficult challenges of text mining, image mining and anomaly detection.

The lessons learnt are easily extensible to the unique challenges we are called upon to solve in our corner of the world. I heartily recommend this book-two thumbs up!",5

Am finding it hard to get motivated to pick it up again. I did learn one thing from the book, however:

John Harpur,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Computational Brain (Computational Neuroscience),A source of stimulation and frustration,"There is an argument that this is a book of its time. It is nearly fifteen years since it was put together and a great deal of neural water has flowed under the bridge. The thematic enthusiasm for computationalism that dominates the book has not been convincingly proved in the meantime. If anything, the computational properties of models have been shown to entertain many unpleasant complexity results. Moreover, the localisation of brain functions grounded in naive interpretations of lesion effects has come under greater scrutiny due to detailed MRI results. Given twhat was known at the time, it is unsurprising that the book focuses on the visual system - a focus also found in Christof Koch's recent book. Acknowleding all that and more, it would be hard to find a better condensation of science, computationalism, and philosophical speculation than in this book.

Leaving aside downsides arising from recent discoveries that the authors could not have anticipated, the book can be frustrating to read at times. In particular, there is a tendency to introduce technical concepts and descriptors into accounts without prior definition. For example, very early on in a brief account of monkey vision there is mention of V4, MT, etc. The terms are neither defined nor explained. Strangely, in the introduction to networks, the inner product of two vectors is explained while the outer product is not. Small points but the oversight recurs.

The philosophical content in the book is light, but the assumptions driving the work are among the most contentious. There is no point reaming off a list but the book does not shirk supporing the brain-as-a-computer hypothesis.

All in all a stimulating work, if in need of updating.",15
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Computational Brain (Computational Neuroscience),Excellent,"This book can be viewed as one of the first attempts to use results from psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and philosophy with the intent of gaining an understanding of how the mind/brain works, but all of this is done within the ""computational mind"" paradigm. The approach taken by the authors is one of the most honest of those in the literature, for throughout the book they are careful to note just how much evidence there is to support their position(s), and to what extent further work is to done. Philosophically speaking, the authors are clearly in the materialist camp, believing that Cartesian dualism does not cohere with current scientific knowledge. But they state that materialism is not an established fact, allowing the possibility, but not the probability, that dualism may in fact be true. They reject early on though any ""arguments from ignorance"" in their assertion that just because neuroscience does not have an explanation of consciousness, that such an explanation is impossible. The authors call the failure to be able to think of consciousness in terms of neuronal activity ""intuition dissonance"", and reject completely its efficacy in establishing the truth of the nature of the mind/brain.
The underlying theme in the book is to explain emergent properties as ""high-level"" effects that are dependent on ""lower-level"" phenomena, hence rejecting the thesis that they are ""nomologically autonomous"", i.e. that such a dependence cannot be done and is outside the domain of science. The science in this book recognizes its historical origins, and it is clear that the authors will not accept explanations of the mind/brain that do not involve scientific experimentation and analysis. Much has been done experimentally in neuroscience since this book was published, especially using the techniques of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A brief discussion of MRI is given in the Appendix of the book, but no doubt if the book were updated there would be a lengthy overview of it. The current experimental situation in neuroscience has led some to predict a total ""reverse engineering"" of the brain in the upcoming decades. This prediction is an optimistic one, but no doubt detailed knowledge of the brain will continue to accelerate, this being a sign of what the authors call ""a remarkable time in the history of science"".
The authors devote an entire chapter to the computational modeling of the brain, mostly of course dealing with the mathematics of neural networks. The approach in this chapter though is still at a level that would allow a general audience to follow it. Readers with a background in physics, especially statistical physics, will appreciate more the discussion on Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines. Experimental results are inserted as graphs throughout the book, with detailed explanation. As a whole the discussion of the biology of the brain is purely descriptive, and the line drawings could stand some improvement.
The chapter on neuronal plasticity is the most interesting in the book, the authors viewing the brain as an entity that is continuously undergoing modification. Their stated goal in the chapter is to explain how the ""local"" property of plasticity can result in the ""global"" property of learning. Clearly intelligence to the authors is an emergent property, i.e. an object or device may be characterized as intelligent without its components being intelligent. Particularly interesting in this chapter was the discussion of the amnesia of a patient who underwent bilateral resection of mesial temporal lobe structures. The time scales of the patient's memory are striking: he remembered things before the surgery but could not remember things that happened a few minutes or hours ago, but could remember things within a minute in his past. The authors also mention the fascinating work of Antonio Damasio and his collaborators, this research being even more important at the present time. The scientific study of consciousness is just beginning and no doubt this study will give many surprises as it develops throughout the twenty-first century.",26

My point is, e.g., a chapter or section starts and the introduction provided to this topic under consideration is almost completely missing. Moreover, the explanations given in the main text are just not good. Sorry, it makes not much sense to collect and present a lot of deep results of scientific articles in statistical learning theory without the necessary explanations.

1. This book assumes that you already have some background and quite a bit of familiarity with the subject

2. While it contains many topics, most materials are only ""presented"" rather than ""clearly explained"". And so, while it may be good as a reference book, at least for me, this definitely shouldn't be your main resource when first studying the subject.

3. Definitely the authors are expert on the field and I just hope they would come up with a much better revision of the book

4. One nice feature of the book ... it contains pretty picture! Unfortunately, just like the old saying, ""a picture contains a thousand words"". Thats exactly what happens here. Some of the pictures are hard to understand.

King Yin Yan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Representation and Reasoning),only 8 reviews so far?,"Of course, this book is a classic, and the low number of reviews is only because it was published in the 80s.

This book has revolutionized the field of AI, and made Bayesian networks ubiquitous in computer science today (though, BNs were first proposed in 1970 by Suppes or perhaps even earlier).

[ Interestingly, Suppes used BNs to deal with causality. ]

I think part of this book's originality is the use of a mathematical theory (ie, probability theory) into AI. A similar and earlier revolutionary step was taken by John McCarthy in his use of formal logic in AI.

Chapter 5 is actually about what I'd call probabilistic abduction, but the naming of the chapter is a bit misleading.

Gardenfors puts forward a a model to explain cognition that he calls ""conceptual spaces."" These conceptual spaces are at a level of abstraction in between the symbolic (used by AI types) and connectionist (Neural Nets). But what makes his conceptual spaces interesting and plausible is the position he takes that in this conceptual space, most reasoning is done by evaluating the analog of a distance between two aspects of a perception. Or, we find things to be similar if they are ""geometrically"" (measurably) closer on some limited number of dimensional scales.
This is easy to follow for things like colors, but he doesn't stop there. He goes on to describe how this explains a wide variety of perceptions, as well as how we form and reform categories and concepts, and shows how this informs semantics and the process of induction.

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,3.0 out of 5 stars,Conceptual Spaces: The Geometry of Thought (MIT Press),A little disappointing,"If one is to design a machine that can formulate concepts and engage in such things as inductive inference and its corollary scientific discovery, then one must be able to quantify the notion of a concept in such a way that it can be implemented into the cognitive structure of the machine. One must be able to distinguish one concept from another, be able to tell when one concept is similar to another, and understand in detail how concepts are related across domains. It would not be enough to have qualitative notions of these distinctions or similarities, since they must be able to be formatted in such a way, either via coding, language, or electronically, so as to be used by the machine.
This book gives an interesting approach to the problem of concept classification, but it does so only from a qualitative point of view. It is a good start in this regard, and readers will gain a lot of insight into the problems that it addresses. It does not however give any advice on how to implement its ideas into a real thinking machine. Mathematical concepts are brought in order to talk more meaningfully about spaces of concepts, but they are really restricted to metric spaces and not general enough to deal with the plethora of concepts that could present themselves in typical environments. The book should be considered more as a work in philosophy, so those interested in this field might enjoy the book more than those who were expecting a book more geared towards artificial intelligence and computer science. Those readers interested in automated theorem proving or automated mathematical discovery might find the discussion on geometric categorization models of interest, and will find an interesting application of Voronoi tessellations, namely that of accounting for the varying sizes of concepts in a categorization.
By far the most interesting chapter in the book is chapter 6, wherein the author gives a highly original discussion of inductive inference. The ability of human cognition to generalize from a limited number of observations is viewed (correctly) by the author as very impressive, but he is careful to note that inductive inference cannot be done free of side constraints. Quoting the philosopher J.S. Peirce and his evolutionary explanation of why induction is so effective, the author uses his theory of conceptual spaces to develop a theory of constraints for inductive inferences. The main notion in this theory is that of ""projectability"", which attempts to delineate the properties and concepts that are may be used in inductive inference. The author wants to arrive at a computational model of induction, and he offers interesting proposals for doing so, even if they lack immediate empirical justification.
Central to the problem of induction the author argues is how observations are to be represented. This has been neglected in the history of philosophy he says, and so he then proceeds to outline his ideas on how to represent observations, distinguishing three levels, namely the `symbolic', the `conceptual', and the `subconceptual.' At the symbolic level, observations are represented by describing them in a specified language. At the conceptual level, observations are characterized relative to a conceptual space. At this level induction is viewed as concept formation. At the subconceptual level observations are characterized by inputs from sensory receptors. Induction is then viewed as the attaining of connections between various inputs. The author views the processing taking place in artificial neural networks as an example of modeling at the subconceptual level.
The problem of induction is more complicated than is typically presented in the literature, the author argues. Inductive inference will look different depending on which approach to observations is taken. In his elaborations on the processes of induction, one of the key issues that arises is the how discovery takes place across different domains. The process of conceptualizing across different domains takes place, as expected, at the subconceptual and conceptual levels. The symbolic level is delegated to formulating laws.",32

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Computer Vision with SimpleCV: The Simple Way to Make Technology See,"Disappointed, no index (!) or color images (but keeps referring to colors in examples)","First of all, it is inexcusable to publish a technical book without an index.

I am reading chapter 5 and the text refers to a function mentioned in a previous chapter. How can I find this one function? There is no index, so am I to scan through the free-flowing text of the first 4 chapters looking for one function in many?

The lack of color images makes this book less useful than it could be. It's almost comical when on page 92 an image is shown (Fig 5-9) and then on page 94 (Fig 5-10) the converted grayscale image is presented - when BOTH are shown in grayscale in the book. On page 95 it says ""let's work with a picture of a yellow glue gun"" .. but only a grayscale image is shown. By the way I tried to see if any of the images were available on O'Reilly's site, but if they are, I wasn't able to find them. That would have been helpful.

Finally, there are a number of typos/errors in the book (see the errata on O'Reilly's site)

I believe the authors are knowledgeable about the subject, and the text is written in an easy conversational tone, however this book is marred by the above mentioned serious shortcomings and I would not recommend it. Very disappointed.

UPDATE: Sample files can be found on the SimpleCV site itself (though it's odd they are not also housed on the O'Reilly site) - look for a link at the bottom of the book page ( http://simplecv.org/book )",6

Kenneth Finnegan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Computer Vision with SimpleCV: The Simple Way to Make Technology See,A little half baked,"I was looking forward to a book titled ""Practical Computer Vision."" When so many of the other texts drop into math so quickly, I wanted a more pragmatic approach to CV. I'm afraid this book may have swung a little too far in the opposite direction.

First of all, the fact that the release date got pushed back several times started to set off some alarm bells for me. There are still sentences in this book where the author seems to have a verb. Furthermore, there seem to be many issues with the figures in the book:
* It seems the author forgot to include image examples (or ran out of time making them) for one or two of the code snippets.
* The entire book suffers grossly from the fact that the author seemingly forgot that it was going to be printed in black and white; countless times he uses color to illustrate something. ""The points of interest have been highlighted in yellow."" It's all grey...
* Every figure between 8.10 and 8.14 are the exact same image. He refers to them as the various steps for edge detection, but seems to have forgotten to actually *DO* anything on the original image.

Overall, I was disappointed with this book. I was hoping for a practical introduction to how computer vision works, but instead got a practical introduction to how to use SimpleCV for computer vision. Any of the algorithms for computer vision I was interested in understanding were simply wrapped in magical SimpleCV function calls; a more apt title would have been ""Using SimpleCV (for Practical Computer Vision)."" That by itself would have been forgivable, but the fact that the book then ends up feeling like a rush job leaves me questioning what this book would really be good for.

If I had no clue how computer vision worked, and wanted to write a tinker-toy computer vision program like PhotoBooth, a new edition of this book might be interesting. As it is, I didn't find it useful, and kept checking to see if ""Draft Edition"" was printed on the spine and they had sent it to me by mistake.",26

Other books do a better job of formal proofs but this book is light years ahead of any other in terms of helping you develop an intuitive understanding of why a given proof or construction is correct.

The proofs are preceded by a ""proof idea"" that outlines what's going on before you get into the rigorous details. The writing is fluid and discusses the implications of the theorems and why they're important. This gives the reader an appreciation of the topic, which is a rare thing in something this arcane.

In fact, all of the examples provided were outdated by at least 45-50 years. Some of the devices used in the examples no longer existed (like some pre-historic tape machines).

I later took the same class with another teacher who didn't use any books but instead used examples like soda machine that dispenses correct change, etc. Much more helpful.

Corbett is out to kill this very clever and wily old leopard in the second half of the 1920's. The leopard is believed to have made its debut as a man-killer following the influenze outbreak of 1918. Corbett hunts this killer over two years. In an intense battle of nerves between the best shikari that ever was and the wily leopardus, corbett's life hangs by a thread many times. On one dark stormy night, robbed of his defenses, he makes his way back to the village after a failed attempt in an experience that he terms his scariest. Another time the leopard snatches a goat right under his nose and gives him a run for his money! All and many illustrations of man's utter helplessness when a clever maneater turns against him.
In the end, corbett suceeds in putting a bullet where it truly belongs - in the maneater - to end its career. In true corbett fashion he has a soft spot for the old dead leopard, which gave him such a sporty fight. I am sure they both met again in the happy hunting grounds!

Sidharth Kshatriya,5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations (Oxford Master Series in Physics),This is a great introduction to algorithms and computations in Statistical Mechanics,"This is a great introduction to algorithms and computations in Statistical Mechanics. The book does not assume a lot of prior knowledge of Physics/Statistical Mechanics which is a great plus. This book is rare because it takes a very strong computational approach towards Physics (unlike most Physics textbooks that approach the subject with a very analytical approach with ""nice"" functions). The computational approach is really the approach you need to take when doing ""real"" Physics, in my opinion.

I also find that the book has a rare and sparse elegance too it: Its not needlessly verbose and the author explains his subject without drowning you in words. The approach is not to drown you in equations (either) but teach you just enough so that you understand the Computer Algorithm (which is the primary focus). There are a lot of interesting graphs and diagrams across the book too.

The algorithms explained in this book like the Metropolis algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Random Walks etc. have widespread application in areas outside Physics too. So I would recommend this book to people who find these algorithms abstract to take a look to get a good feel on how these algorithms work in a concrete setting. In other words, even if you are not a physicist, understanding how these algorithms work in physical systems will help in other areas like Machine Learning!

I am almost at the end of a MOOC on Statistical Mechanics taught by the author of this book. The MOOC is amazing (like the book). Ideally it would be amazing to read this book in conjunction with the course but this may not be possible for everyone, of course.

If I would offer a suggestion it would be the author should choose a particular computer language for the algorithms in this book in a future edition. Currently they are in psuedocode. Of course, this way these algorithms are more generic and can be implemented by interested readers in any language. But by implementing them in a particular language they become more ""alive"". In the MOOC course I'm taking, these algorithms are implemented in Python and there is a sort of instantaneous and interesting quality to them. You can run them, you can play around with them. This is not the case with the psuedocode in the book, sadly.",4

If you are interested in using GA for solution-finding, I doubt you'll find much useful in this book beyond the first chapter or so. Many of the examples later in the book were so specific that I couldn't see how they could be usefully generalized. Really optimizing a GA approach for a specific problem domain takes a fair amount of tuning, and this book won't help much with that.

Thomas Wikman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Neural Networks for C#, 2nd Edition",Practical introduction to Neural Networks in C# (plus mistakes),"This is a practical introduction to Neural Networks using the C# programming language. The book is filled with examples and implementations and the corresponding code is listed in the book and on his website. Unfortunately I saw no zip file or other downloadable archive so you have to copy and paste the code. The book discusses the simple Hopfield network and the standard feed forward back propagation networks, self organizing networks (Kohonen), as well as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing used independently and in conjunction with neural networks. The book covers matrix algebra and pruning of neural networks and some interesting applications such as predictive neural networks (financial prediction), OCR, and Bot programming. I thought the chapter summaries and review questions were quite helpful. The book also features useful appendixes and a useful glossary (and index).

The examples were illustrative and useful and the book was well organized. The writing style was a bit mechanical but the book was otherwise well written and fairly clear. Unfortunately it seems to contain some typos in the math and equations and that will confuse you a lot more than a typo in the text would. In chapter two page 63 the rows and columns in the weight matrix seems mixed up and on page 278 there is dot product that is completely wrong. The top of page 168 features a paragraph that is complete BS but it did not deter from understanding any of the important content.

SDB Mike,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Neural Networks for C#, 2nd Edition","Necessary practical review of methods for NNs, needs polishing","The author provides a needed introductory level book for NNs. I have several theoretical books on my shelf that hit me like a brick wall. Sifting through code with accompanying explanatory information is a luxury for non-theoretical folks like myself. Sadly, physically crunching the numbers (okay, letting code do it) while monitoring code execution is what some of us need to get a mathematical idea to sink in. This book provides that.

That being said, the author writes very mechanically, bordering on robotic. Just a little more writing finesse would greatly improve the readability. The text is still quite readable, though, and the references are available to dig deeper (Neural Smithing, for instance). In addition, for folks interested in the code architecture, this book is sadly lacking. Theoretical and mathematical information is first presented, followed by most of the code, and then code walkthrough. The code walkthrough is somewhat helpful and necessary, but discussion of the how and why of the code implementation is not adequately addressed. A few choice UML diagrams would greatly improve the reader's understanding of the code flow. This is especially important for the feedback sections.

Now, I bring this up because I think it is vital to an avid reader: I have only read the first 7 chapters. What? Really? And yet I am willing to rate it? Yes. It is the critique above that has kept the book sitting on my shelf the past several weeks. This is very interesting and directly applicable material and I should be willing and ready to devour it... and yet, I'm not. I will garner the will power to continue to the end because the Bot section was the content that queued me to by the book.

You will learn some things about neural network organization, training and applications. Along the way, you will even see C# code for performing addition and printing text to the console. Unfortunately, this book does not really provide a whole lot of information about anything. It will introduce an idea without giving the reader a good intuition for how to apply it, then move on. Then it will re-introduce the same idea in the next chapter, but again the explanation will leave something to be desired. At least the low information-density makes this book a quick read. (Figure 1-1 illustrates this important concept with an instructive diagram.) If nothing else, after reading this book you should be able to write a ""hello, world"" program in C# and perhaps define a neural network. That concludes by discussion of Jeff Heaton's ""Introduction to Neural Networks"" which, in case you forgot, is a book about neural networks -- an important topic in computer science.

Todd Ebert,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prolog Programming for Artificial Intelligence (4th Edition) (International Computer Science Series),An excellent book for learning prolog and AI,"Having just read a book on automated reasoning which covered topics in logic, such as unification and resolution, I was very pleased with the prolog programming language, in that it takes concepts from logic, and uses them in ways that can be applied to a number of interesting areas of AI, such as NLP, planning, and expert systems. I thought Bratko succeeded in making this connection with logic, without burdening the reader with notation and concepts that are really not needed for writing or understanding prolog programs.
The book also worked for me on the level of providing a good introduction to the syntax and sematics of the language. The first 200 pages succeed to this end.
Finally, the last 13 chapters can be summarized as representing an introduction to AI from a prolog perspective. On the positive side, he shows how to apply prolog to all of the modern, main streams of AI study. However, on the negative, the slant towards prolog in these chapters tends to oversimplify these disciplines.
My impression of the language is that it seems good as a prototying language, since it is declarative in nature, but from my experimentation (using SWI Prolog) I think I could write better implementations using c or java.
In closing, Bratko's book represents a very good place to start learning prolog and the world of AI.",17

Sachmo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Software Requirements 2,3.5 stars... worth reading but reads like a verbose work instruction,"I did not find this book as good as other reviewers seemed to think.

To give a bit of a background, I'm work on a fairly complex robotics system with both hardware and software components. Determining system requirements is one of the major tasks that I perform on a daily basis.

I did find this book useful, as after reading it I had a much better perspective from the 5000 foot level of how requirements affect the entire business organization and product development process. It really drills down the importance of understanding what it is you are trying to build before designing a product. This book is 100% useful to engineers that focus on hardware as well as software - don't be fooled by the title.

My main gripe with the book is that it reads like an overly verbose company work instruction (imagine a dry and somewhat boring employee orientation manual). There are entire pages of material that could have been summed up much better in a paragraph or so, or with an effective picture. Many of the flow charts in the book for example read like your typical overly complex and useless business process charts that no one would ever actually reference when they do their job.

For the record, I don't have a problem with flow-charts, but they need to be simple to be effective, and despite what I stated above, there are a couple flow-chart gems in the book.

On to the specifics...

Section I of the book focuses on a very general overview of requirements, roles that different people perform in relation to requirements (i.e. designers, product managers, project managers, system analyst, testers, etc.). I found most of this material to be useless, except for comparing how my company structured itself versus standard practice across the industry. I imagine that anyone working at a company with any sort of formalized requirements process wouldn't get too much out of this section either.

Section II is a bit better. It begins with a focus on the business aspects of requirements. Without a clear scope document and business vision, the requirements are meaningless. It goes on to argue the importance of customer feedback during the requirements development process. I think some clearer explanation on gathering customer feedback, with specific case studies for how to drill down customer desires into tangible features to incorporate into a product would have gone a long way here... but I generally agree with the philosophy. Much of the use case / customer feedback chapters were too general to be useful though.

Section II also covers good practices in documenting requirements. I took this part for granted because my company has many of these practices already in place, but had I been working for a smaller company or startup, I would have found these organizational tips to be invaluable. This is really great material if you don't have any formalized process in place.

Section III covers a lot of issues related to version control, changing requirements during the development process, maintaining traceable requirements... This section is boring, and could have benefited by being more concise as well. Reading it did give me a better perspective of the requirements process however.

Section IV, a very short section, was really one of the best parts of the book. It ties together the other sections in some of the effective flow charts of the book as to how requirements management is a PROCESS, and one that lies at the heart of good product development. If you've ever been through a project and had a gut feeling that major decisions were being rushed without due consideration, or that the wrong tasks were being prioritized, this section will crystallize how things should have gone in that project. It covered a few things I hadn't seen before, such as measuring requirements volatility, which is a good way to get a handle on how well the product is defined over a long period of time.

Finally in the appendices, there are a couple hidden gems that cover the maturity level of a company, and what level of requirements management are actually NEEDED by company depending on the project. For a simple project, requirement management tools would be major overkill.

Overall a good book for managing requirements. People that work on large, technically challenging projects in large groups / organizations would find this book especially useful. It suffers though from being way too long for the information that it is trying to impart.

My review might a little harsh, as I could see myself re-reading a couple selected parts of this book from time to time, but I simply would never rate this book anything close to 5 stars, and I'm surprised by how high other reviewers have esteemed this book.",2
K. Parmalee,4.0 out of 5 stars,Software Requirements 2,Enlightening Read for a Requirements Novice Like Me,"When I first purchased this book back in 2006, I went through most of it fairly quickly, and even downloaded some of Wiegers supplementary material from processimpact.com. Some of my colleagues took notice and together we formed a mini-workshop using the downloaded materials, which we used to gather requirements for an enhancement to one of the applications I assist in managing.

A merger and subsequent reorganization later, I found the time to finish the book. I recommend it for the developer or technical manager who finds themselves in a project that lacks thorough requirements development. The book uses appropriate tone and terminology to address its' intended audience; it is neither too simplistic nor overly dense. It has enough supplementary material to preclude the need to build a requirements development process from scratch without looking too much like a cookbook. Its' bibliography includes several classics and many references not familiar to me. All in all, a balanced book about requirements development and management.",1
Chris Kessel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Software Requirements 2,Great practical advice on requirements,"I'm somewhat of a software engineering/process geek. I find the process of creating a product more interesting than the actual code these days (though I like to code). Wiegers' book is THE bible, in my opinion, for eliciting and maintaining requirements.
He covers the issues involved in gathering requirements and keeping them up to date, often offering multiple ways to resolve issues. Wiegers, unlike many academic oriented books, fully acknowledges the political and cultural difficulties that arise when trying to institute a requirements program. Much of his advice is practical and he gives good pointers on the highst ROI practices, so you can inject a little at a time, rather than trying to change culture wholesale.
I'd give a 4.5 out of 5 if I could, due only to the ""Next Steps"" sections at the end of each chapter. The ""Next Steps"" are supposedly be small steps you can take to start using the advice Wiegers offers. Unfortunately, most of the steps start with ""Take a page/chapter from your current requirements document...."" I've worked at few companies that even have a requirements document, so I'm not sure how useful the ""Next Steps"" really are.
But, that complaint aside, this book is the best combination of reference information for techniques and advice on how to use them on the job.",16
Alex,5.0 out of 5 stars,Software Requirements 2,"Excellent and very practical book, I DO recommend it","I do recommend this book, both for experienced of novice sofware developers or consultants for several reasons:

1. The content has a great balance between practical advice and theory, so it won't burden you with information applicable to 5% (e.g. huge projects) of your daily work
2. It is well written, both in content and edition style (format) so it is very easy to read and understand quickly
3. It has references to standards and literacy but it is just to illustrate and not so heavily that makes it hard to read

To sum up, its one of the very best SW Engineering books I've read so far and so that I do recommend it.

Information theory itself is fascinating. Unfortunately, without math, there seems little point in the effort. The viewpoint is fresh, and the author is enthusiastic, but there's not much new material here.

Jaume Puigbo Vila,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes","Information theory, the third physics revolution of the XXth century","The author has a degree in probability theory and artificial intelligence, but he is a professor of journalism and has therefore written a book which is both very entertaining and not too difficult to understand. The subject is information, which Seife claims is the third XXth century revolution in physics started by Claude Shannon and which has relations with the other two: Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.

Of course, information is also related to thermodynamics and entropy, so the book contains a discussion of all these topics: thermodynamics, relativity and quantum mechanics. Famous conundrums such as Schroedinger's cat, entanglement, Maxwell's demon, etc. are analyzed from the point of view of information theory.

Here are some snippets of the book:

According to Seife, Einstein dictum ""Nothing can travel faster than light"" is really about information:"" Information speed cannot exceed c"". Another interesting fact is that what really causes computers to heat is the erasure of bits.

Seife describes recent achievements and experiments, proof that he is familiar with the latest results. One curious example is the solution of ""the knight problem"" in 2000 by using a DNA computer! Another one is that the entire human race has less genetic diversity than a few scores of chimps due to some kind of cataclysm about 500,000 years ago. A third one is the 1996 experiment demonstrating the existence of virtual particles (the so called Casimir effect).

In chapter 7, quantum computers are introduced and the possibility of the brain being one is briefly discussed. Unfortunately, it seems that Max Tegmark proved Roger Penrose wrong on this count. You begin to understand the power of quantum computation when the author describes Grover's algorithm to guess a number out of 16. Classically you need four yes/no answers to four questions. Grover manages the same task with two. Quantum computation reduces the complexity of some problems from n to square root of n.

I found also very interesting the reasons why the photoelectric effect cannot be explained by waves. On the other hand, interference cannot be explained by a corpuscular theory of light, so we are stuck with duality.

Towards the end, the author discusses black holes and the holographic principle: the quantity of information contained in a ball is not limited by its volume (surprisingly), but by its area. Since most cosmologists consider now the universe infinite (inflation seems to imply this) we are led, via the holographic bound, to the conclusion that the universe contains infinite copies of our own bubble universe. Seife admits that this is the most bizarre thing among the many ones described in his book.",7
Elton Hall,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes",Information and Understanding the Universe,"Information is the key to the mysteries of the universe, according to Charles Seife, author of Zero and now of Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes (Penguin Books, 2006, ii + 296 pp.). This information is not like the letters on a page (which encode information that allows us to read words), though it includes that. It also includes any kind of charge or registered change of state, such as a 0 or 1 in computer talk. In fact, anything that can be represented by 0's and 1's is information, and all information can be so registered. In explaining how information theory has transformed thinking in the sciences, Seife covers a lot of ground--cosmology, quantum theory, biology, etc., etc.

Seife does a fine job of explaining some key concepts in information theory, such as redundancy--the use of clues to indicate what some piece of information actually is. One such is the use of vowels even when not needed for capturing the words. Th ct n th ht, probably does not need the vowels to be understood. `Ingenius' and `ingenuous' would, however. One thing I did not know, meaning I was utterly clueless about, is that computers, which use compressed files that eliminate all sorts of redundancy, do make errors, though we virtually never see them because there are built-in checks and balances that catch and correct them. Since a computer operates entirely on 0's and 1's, or, more literally, on charges and lack of charges, all information that we normally think of as information can be recorded in this way.

What Seife wishes to show is that information theory underlies physics and other sciences and that understanding that much helps to deal with a variety of problems, from probabilities to the famous Schrödinger's cat to black holes and what happens around them. He also discusses some problems that have yet to be resolved. Without attempting to explain his explanations, which make sense upon reading but can be difficult to keep clearly in mind, he uses as examples DNA sequences, mathematical formulas for the expansion of gases (which exactly parallel equations for the transmission of information!), and probabilities associated with questions like the state of Schrödinger's cat before anyone looks. He illuminates the issue of light functioning as a wave and as particles through information theory, showing that, while light might be considered neither or both, thought of as information resolves the paradoxes associated with it.

The book, as he warns, has a dreary side, since information is closely tied to entropy, the diffusion of energy until it is evenly distributed throughout the universe. Information theory itself suggests that we are doomed to a future (incomprehensibly long in the future) when all information disappears, that is, entropy is total. For information requires differences in energy levels--a distinction between 0 and 1, so to speak--to exist, and, for Seife, everything is information. The time will come when there will be no such differences. There are more immediate threats to our existence, however.",5

Camber,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes","Muddy Thinking, Fuzzy Writing","Count me with the other reviewers who gave this book 2 stars. I think their criticisms are generally on target, and the book is lacking on pretty much every level.

First of all, the book lacks clarity, with few of the concepts and arguments explained clearly. Part of the problem may be the avoidance of math, as is common in popular science books. However, as I labored to get through the book, my impression grew ever stronger that Seife actually doesn't understand the subject matter well enough himself, so the fuzziness seems to stem mainly from that. It's as though he has learned his science primarily from popular science books, rather than taking the time to learn the material rigorously. This subject evidently needs a serious scientist, not a journalist who happens to be interested in science.

Tied to this, I didn't care for Seife's writing style. As other reviewers noted, his writing has the quality of trying to oversell the ideas, and relies too much on silly metaphors, as though that could somehow substitute for clarity.

The book also largely lacks a necessary philosophical dimension. The concept of energy is quite abstract and underlies all of natural science (energy isn't tangible material ""stuff"" you can hold in your hand, but is rather more like a general capacity to cause change), and Seife doesn't seem to realize this. But then he goes further and asserts that information, which is even more abstract than energy, is ""physical,"" yet he offers no real discussion of how to interpret that claim. Instead, he just forces the information idea on many areas of science (thermodynamics, quantum theory, biology, cosmology, etc.), as though asserting a bunch of relatively vague connections is a substitute for clear definitions and careful scientific reasoning.

Having said all of this, let me note that I actually do think that the thesis regarding the fundamental role of information is plausible, perhaps even probable -- Seife writes as though he came up with the idea, even though it's by no means original to him. The problem is simply that Seife proves unable to properly explore this thesis, and he certainly fails to adequately make the case for it in this book.

With this book having turned out a bust, despite the thesis being plausible, the question is what to try next. I know of two other popular books on this subject, Information: The New Language of Science by Hans Christian von Baeyer and The Bit and the Pendulum: From Quantum Computing to M Theory-The New Physics of Information by Tom Siegfried, but the reviews for these books raise the concern that they might not be much better than Seife's book. Another book, apparently written at a much higher level and published by Springer Verlag, is Information and Its Role in Nature (The Frontiers Collection) by Juan Roederer, and I think that one looks more promising.

But getting back to Seife's book, I'd recommend skipping it entirely. I found it to be an insult to the reader's intelligence, and a waste of the reader's time. My time has already been wasted, but yours doesn't have to be also ...",16

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes","Well written, but only for the true layperson","This is a gentle introduction to a fascinating subject: that information actually has a physical basis in the universe and that information theory (based on the work of Shannon to determine how much information can theoretically be transmitted across phone lines, but carried by Shannon and his successors far, far further)may actually be fundamental in explaining quantum mechanics and indeed our entire universe.

The book starts with basic description of entropy and definitions of information and proceeds to discussions of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and such interesting topics as whether Black Holes destroy information or not (Hawkings bet they did, but ultimately conceded...as Seife notes, Hawkings may be the only one who actually changed his mind).

Seife is a clear writer and great at creating an argument step-by-step.

However... I was a math major, a physics minor and am a working computer scientist with years of coursework in automata and complexity theory. Though there was new material in this book for me, vast swathes were way too introductory for me. I really didn't need a 20 page description of how bits are the fundamental element of information and strings of bits can encode anything, or for that matter to rehash special relativity or the selfish gene theory. Though it mostly succeeds, this book may be a little too ambitious. It tries to start with first principles for the layman, but spans so many fields (thermodynamics, information theory, quantum mechanics, biology, cosmology, special and general relativity) that providing basic introductions to all of them greatly dilutes the new and interesting material.

I really wish I knew what to read next. From here it appears most things are other popularizations or deeply technical works for specialists in quantum computing.

David J. Kreiter,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes",Information is physical,"Charles Seife has not been the first to proclaim that the most fundamental entity in the universe is ""information"". Physicist John Wheeler, David Bohm, and Tom Siegfried among others have held this view as well, but no other author I've read has gone to such lengths to establish this idea as an undeniable conclusion.

In a consise staight-forward format, Siefe delves into biology, computer science, cosmology, Relativity, and quantum theory, to establish the notion that information and the second law of thermodynamics are intricately linked. And he does this without ever allowing the reader to become lost or confused.

Information is always physical, whether it is marks on paper, holes in a punch card, atoms in an electo-magnetic state on a CD, photon polarization, or up/down spin on an electron. All information has a physical representation. And like any physical thing in our universe, it abides by the laws of nature, including the laws of thermodynamics and Relativity. Information, like energy, can neither be created nor destroyed. Infomation always moves toward the most probable state: maximum entropy. And no information can travel faster than the speed of light.

The qubit, which is the quantum representation of the classical bit, abides by the laws of quantum physics, and despite the weird instantaneous quantum connection between particles in an entangled state demonstrated by Bell's theorem of inequality; the qubit does not violate faster-than-light communication. Oddly, the qubit does violate one tenant of Relativity--that no effect can precede its cause. It seems that the time-asymetrical qubit has no ""before"" or ""after"".

Unlike the classical bit wich resides in a binary, either/or state, the qubit can be in a superposition of states: Two states simultaneously. This fact is what makes the possibility of quantum computing so enticing. By nesting probable outcomes in a superposition of states many fewer yes/no questions are needed in algorithms, making quantum computing many orders of magnitude faster than classical computing.

But, far wider implications exist for the quantum qubit. Siefe believes that the qubit's superposition of states solves two contentious vagaries of the Copenhagen Interpretation of reality: What constitutes an observer? And is there a difference between the classical and quantum worlds?

Siefe says that there is no clear-cut demarcation between the subatomic and classical world, and there is no conscious observer required to collapse the wave function. This directly leads to a resolution of the famous Schrodinger's cat paradox. Since the universe at large is constantly involved in probing with light waves, neutrinos, and zero point energy, the universe itself acts as the observer. Large macro objects such as cats undergo decoherence (a collapse of the superposition of states into a classical bit) very rapidly, while a single subatomic particle or photon take a much longer time, being less likely to come into contact with nature's measurements.

Information is so fundamental that Siefe believes Richard Dawkins popular book called ""The Selfish Gene"", would have been more appropriately titled ""Selfish Information"". Siefe says that when it comes to biological organisms, information is even more selfish than the gene, and can run contrary to survival of the fittest. He cites several examples of information reproducing itself even though it is detrimental to the organism, and at times, to the entire species. Information will attempt to replicate even at the expense of the proliferation of the organism carrying the information.

This book was very enticing, and left me with some questions. Is it information that is the most basic entity, or is it ""meaning"" as physicist David Bohm maintains? Is there a difference between information and meaning? Experiments with polarization of light lead me to suspect that there is a difference.

And, finally, is the brain really a classical machine as Siefe says, or is it a quantum machine as Evan Harris Walker maintains? (See my review: ""The Physics of Consciousness"" on Amazon). Either way, Charles Seife is right on the mark with this work. I give this book 4.5 stars for being an excellent and fun read.

Stanley B. Klein,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes",Not good,"Bad idea and bad presentation. I read the ""zero"" book (essentially a history) and was poised to have another interesting popularization of a key construct (information).

What I find, instead, is stipulation, assertion, failure to address (much less recognize -- best I can tell from what is written) weighty issues that continue to blur the lines between epistemology and ontology, and a smattering of formalization and empirical demonstration. And, as best I can tell, these sit in superposition with no discernible (or conceptually satisfying) arrangement even after the wave collapses.

The author, if he truly wants to elucidate (assuming he can) would better serve the intelligent public by dwelling on the implications of one (or a very few) highly debatable issues -- e.g., ""information is physical"" (or perhaps ""perception is reality""; btw is this idealism?) and trying to show in a logically compelling way why these stipulations have any rational traction. Instead, we get bits (no pun here) of ideas that beg (and question beg) for considered treatment absent any serious attempt to logically sanction the ideas presented.

What a mess.

An aside -- this short book would be shorter still if the author did not have the tendency to repeat himself (often in adjacent sentences).

Also, the device ""X, Y, Z...and even N"", where we start off with something remote physically or conceptually (e.g., X = atom, quark, etc.) and end with something silly (e.g., N = cats, pintos, piles of poop) is a sophomoric device used once. The author uses it with sad frequency.

Finally, as per style, announcing that ""this is really ""troubling"", weird"", ""upsetting"" every few paragraphs is, well, troubling in and of itself.

This is not a good effort, even for the pop science audience.",1
tacfire,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes",Great Read...!,"Great Book, But...!

Quantum mechanics made fun and easy! I guess all those ""Physics for Dummies,"" books paid off `cause Seife really makes it all understandable!

However...! I was thoroughly vexed by Seife painfully contradicting himself regarding the first law of thermodynamics and the Big Bang.

Page 31, after stating very clearly that energy cannot be created or destroyed, he footnotes (4) ...""But all the energy (including Einstein's mass-energy) currently in our universe was created with the big bang, and that amount hasn't changed since the universe's birth.""

Note the ""was created,"" in the passive voice.

So, if mass-energy can't be created or destroyed, how ""was"" it created and by whom/what?

All through his book ""Zero,"" Seife seems to deride the West for avoiding zero out of fear of nothingness, the void, infinity-G-d. That fear strangled mathematical and scientific advancements for a millennium. Yet here he makes an assertion with the similar fear-induced tone.

Here's the brutal heresy that Seife dares not state:

Why is there ""something"" rather than ""nothing?""

Perhaps because ""nothing"" is a concept with no physical reality. Perhaps because the amount of mass and energy are the ""entropic reality"" for our universe.

By simply applying the First Law of Thermodynamics that states that matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed, our universe has always existed in some form, with the exact same amount of energy and matter. The Big Bang explains our universe's current viewable configuration.

Sadly, Seife dares not state this obvious axiom, perhaps fearing that he is entering the No G-d domain!

Look in mirror wild-man! It isn't just the ""Dark Ages"" Europeans that feared knowledge!

Other than that..READ THIS BOOK!!!",22

Rather then get bogged down in the academic backing behind semantic data this book sidesteps a the idealistic principles of semantic data to instead focus on getting things done, and what the actual advantages to representing your data as a semantic graph are. As such, it explains how to actually accomplish real, concrete tasks using real technologies - and explains how to do this using simple, but realistic examples, and realistic code.",3
Ralph Hodgson,3.0 out of 5 stars,Programming the Semantic Web: Build Flexible Applications with Graph Data,"Welcomed book, but some disappointments","While I am glad to see books about Semantic Web technologies that are written specifically for software developers, I am disappointed that I cannot give this book more than 3 stars. Why? The book contains misleading statements that may lead a developer new to these technologies astray and encourage non-optimal practices. I will give a few examples illustrating what I mean:

-On page 131, the example explaining property domains may lead the reader to believe that having two separate domain statements (ex:hasEyeColor rdfs: domain ex:Human and ex:hasEyeColor rdfs: domain ex:Animal) is ""the"" way to do things. Such a practice creates issues which are not properly explained. And the diagram 6-1 illustrating this modeling example is wrong. Looking at it, the reader is left believing that the domain of ex:hasEyeColor property is a universe of things that includes Humans and Animals, while in reality it is an intersection of Humans and Animals. If someone were now to add another domain triple such as ex:hasEyeColor rdfs: domain ex:Dog, the domain would become the intersection of Humans, Animals and Dogs and a conclusion could be drawn that Jamie Taylor is a dog - obviously, not what was intended.

-On page 140 it is stated that RDF schemas are usually stored in the same graph with the data they represent. This is not true and, to the contrary, is considered to be a poor practice - keeping schema and data separate is important for schema reuse. Did the writers intended to say that they are usually put in the same triple store? The statement is confusing and it is contradicted by the book examples such as those using FOAF. It is clear that FOAF schema and FOAF data files are separate graphs.

-While modularity is talked about (""semantic data model is not a monolithic thing""), the key mechanisms used for modularity (e.g., imports and named graphs) are not mentioned anywhere.

-Describing SPARQL as a ""read only"" language is not correct. While INSERT or DELETE keywords are not part of SPARQL 1.0, the CONSTRUCT keyword provides a way to create new triples. Developers can also use CONSTRUCT to identify triples to be deleted. I also believe it would have been useful to mention that Jena API (arguably the API most used by the developers building Semantic Web applications) already directly implements inserts and deletes and this implementation is being used in the upcoming SPARQL 2.0 spec. Perhaps, this was not known at the time certain chapters of the book were written.

-The cursory of SPARQL is disappointing. SPARQL mastery is as important to the developer working with the Semantic Web data as SQL mastery is to the developer working with the relational data.

-The blank node example of address raised a concern that the imprecise language used in describing the motivations for using the blank node does not make it clear that a blank nodes can never be referenced across graphs.

In conclusion, the book does a good job covering a broad range of topics in a very concrete, down-to-earth way. It directly addresses some of the key misconceptions about the Semantic Web standards. For example, it makes it very clear that RDF is a data model and RDF/XML is simply one serialization of it. The depth of coverage is insufficient and uneven impacting the book's effectiveness for developers. Some choices of the areas authors decided to focus on are questionable. For example, I would have preferred to see less coverage of Freebase and more of SPARQL. I am also left wondering how much of a peer review the book had received prior to publication. An even modestly rigorous review process would probably have caught the most notable errors, imprecisions and omissions and resulted in a stronger book.",49
Engineer Always Learning,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory (Information Science and Statistics),New to Field of Learning Theory,"I am relatively new to statistical learning theory, though with a solid background in supporting theories and a Master's in Engineering. I found the text readable. I appreciate the historical perspective and the development of concepts by the author. I was generally able to grasp Vapnick's theories and explanations, though often after rereading passages many times.

Simple examples would significantly aid the readability and understandability of the text - akin to the way we teach our children. We don't describe all the attributes of a rabbit, we point to a picture of a rabbit and say ""bunny"". After two or three examples of this my children know the abstract concept of a rabbit (without me having to describe a small, four legged creature with long ears, etc. and then answering the inevitable question of ""What's four legged creature mean daddy?""). Particularly with a text about learning theory, one would think it would be full of such examples - at least from a pedagogical point of view.

Initially, I didn't mind Vapnick's editorializing, but after a while I find it annoying - I'm sure he didn't single-handedly invent the entire field of statistical learning theory, but he sure doesn't miss any opportunities to tell the reader that he believes he has.",2
SLB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB,Great book!,"This is a great book, BUT I think you need to be an engineer to understand it. The book assumes the reader has knowledge of concepts such as probability theory, statistics, and other mathematical concepts like functions, transforms, histograms, PDFs, CDFs, filtering, least-squares, convolution, MMSE, etc. (which I do because I am a wireless communications engineer). I think it also helps to have knowledge of Matlab already, else you will be reading the book very slowly trying to simultaneously understand the image processing concepts and the Matlab code used to implement them. You also must have the image processing toolbox that comes with Matlab to run the code presented, or you will not be able to use it. If you have all these things, it's a very good book. The authors explain the concepts clearly and present all the code - so even if you don't understand every word in the text, you can look at the code and figure it out (or run the code to see what it does), or vice versa. The text and code complement each other nicely. The code is not commented line by line, but general comments are given, and they are usually enough to understand what each function does, and what its inputs and outputs are. Many custom functions are presented, which you can run even if you don't understand every detail but understand the function in general. The book also does a good job of covering both introductory and advanced concepts. What I especially like is that the authors give lots of examples, with code and pictures, to aid in understanding. I've learned a lot about image processing from this book that I don't think I could have gotten otherwise.",2

James Caldwell,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Robot Alchemy: Androids, Cyborgs, and the Magic of Artificial Life",Robot Alchemy....And The Magic of Artificial Life. Caveat Emptor,"I like Texe Marrs a lot. I've actually spoken to him over the phone on a number of occasions, and was warmed by his avuncular and accommodating manner, I also found one of his previous books, 'Codex Magica', an extremely deep revelation into the dark recesses of Freemasonry, and the way they communicate with their sign language. It was on the strength of my first two sentences, and the words 'Alchemy' and 'Magic'in this book's title, that I bought it almost unseen. Much to my surprise, I found little, if any, engagement with the Transhumanist agenda of those such as Ray Kurtzweil's (which is 21st Century Alchemy) awaited singularity, nor anything about the thinking behind how we got to robotics in the first place.

Within the last 600 years anyone who would read cursorily would note that people we would now call 'scientists' today, were nothing short of alchemists who eventually hit the barbed wire at the Enlightenment and then adopted the empirical method. Some continued and were considered 'occultists', in the sense that something hidden is 'occluded'. The Royal Society is full of scientists who consulted old occult alchemical (Nostradamus being perhaps the most infamous example of a practitioner) texts, and it may interest people with an interest in English history that one of Queen Elizabeth I's closest advisors was a man named Dr John Dye - who was a philosopher, spiritualist, and alchemist. Per example, the spirits Dye and his friends (such as Sir Francis Drake) would communicate with spirits who told them that Jesus Christ was neither God, nor the Son of God - which concerns this Christian reviewer: Royalty and politicians are notorious for taking the advice of mediums and astrologers to this day

""Transhumanism"" answered many of my questions on the topic, so seeing Texe write a title on Robot Alchemy was like a red flag to a bull. Let me say it is NOT a bad book, but it is not what I had hoped for, as exemplified in his 'Codex Magica'. It's a great book if you want to find out where we stand in 2013 with everything Robotic/Cyborg/Cybernetic. A great coffee table book which is not difficult to read - but I was hoping that Texe would engage some of Alchemy's basic principles and goals. Quite literally, with robotics, we are getting close to turning the proverbial pig's ear into a silk purse. There is danger ahead: Texe skirts with it. The other book looks at it comprehensably.

I don't think it would be fair to detract stars for my dismay, but I will take two off because using Alchemy in the title led me to think that Texe would give us a Christian perspective on some of those issues. As many of you know, Texe is an outstanding Occult researcher. I have no doubt he could have taken a shot at it. Good book; could have been better.",3

Ray Dillinger,4.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Cognitive Systems: A Primer (MIT Press),Delivers what it says it will. Presents Useful insights. Possibly too brief.,"It's a slim little book but it's a good overview of 'consciousness' as we understand it and as it applies to technologically created intelligences. It addresses fundamental questions like how much does being situated in the world and having means of influencing the world and goals to achieve using that influence contribute to consciousness.

It analyzes the split between the symbolic and subsymbolic AI camps. To be brief the symbolic-AI camp models knowledge as specific, explicitly-represented objective facts that get manipulated by formal, repeatable rules, and the subsymbolic or connectionist camp is all about building systems that adapt, in hard-to-analyze ways, to perform actions and anticipate things in a way that seems to demonstrate knowledge but where the knowledge itself can't easily be understood or extracted as a list of explicit facts or rules. The subsymbolic approach gives rise to belief that an agent must be situated in a world it can perceive and influence, and which it must influence in order to achieve its goals or survive. The symbolic group considers those things to be unnecessary. It's hard to say whether this is a split over whether these methods can achieve consciousness as much as it is a split over what consciousness is in the first place. Either way it's worth considering. Both symbolic and subsymbolic AI, if successful, would be things you can use. The distinction would be that a subsymbolic AI would most likely also be using you.

I consider one of the defining characteristics of ""real"" or humanlike conciousness to be subjective perceptions, desires and needs and independently wanting things and taking action to achieve them. Predictably I'm part of the subsymbolic camp.

I found the sections on self-prediction and fundamental mechanisms for empathy to work to be interesting and (hopefully) useful. There were a few ideas I hadn't considered there, such as how mimicry contributes to empathy and how comparing analysis of one's own success vs anticipation of one's own success contributes to something like self-consciousness.

What this is NOT, is a technical guide to implementation of anything. That's fine, because it doesn't pretend to be or promise to be. Mostly it's exactly what it says on the label: a review of theories about consciousness and how those theories pertain to artificial consciousness.

I thought it was a bit too brief; I'd like to see expanded consideration of most of these topics. It's an overview, not a reference.",3

Jim Davis,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Life of Super-Earths: How the Hunt for Alien Worlds and Artificial Cells Will Revolutionize Life on Our Planet,Interesting and informative but the climax never comes,"In many respects this book is excellent. It has a lot of interesting information about the discovery and composition of exoplanets. The discovery techniques are gone into in commendable detail, especially the transit method. There is also a fair bit of historical background as well. The composition relies more on computer models but the breadth of possible planets (sort of like a planetary ""main sequence"") is also gone into in some detail. The astronomy end of the book is great.

The biology part is a very different matter. Things start off well enough as the details of the origins of terrestrial life are reviewed. Then the author makes the plausible enough claim that a certain amount of geological activity is necessary for the development of life and earth's is just barely adequate. Super-earths, he asserts, with their greater geological activity would be more hospitable to the development of life.

By this point we have arrived at the last chapter. The book has built up to and has been pointing to the climax promised in the the book's title, ""The Life of Super-Earths"". I was expecting the author to tie up the biology and astronomy and show how life on super-earths would differ from life on earth. Naturally this would be somewhat speculative but that doesn't matter.

What we receive instead is a rather lame chapter on synthetic biology. Super-earths disappear from the narrative and we get a description of what biologists are hoping to do in the laboratory. All in all, I felt cheated. The promised punch line never came.

The book can be recommended nonetheless as a relative recent recapitulation of events surrounding exoplanets, both discovery and theory.

The Kindle edition was quite serviceable with a few flaws. There was an amusing glitch where exponents were linked to chapter notes. The print index was printed without the page numbers and was unlinked making it completely useless except as suggestions of terms to search for. Finally, the book was organized into two parts of six chapters each but only the parts are marked on the progress bar.

Baer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Life of Super-Earths: How the Hunt for Alien Worlds and Artificial Cells Will Revolutionize Life on Our Planet,Towards a New Enlightenment,"This interesting book has the subtitle “How the Hunt for Alien Worlds and Artificial Cells will Revolutionize Life on our Planet”. The subtitle explains why I read the book. We need to change things on earth, reject superstition and practice reason.
About halfway through this short clear text Sasselov, now director of the Origins of Life Institute at Harvard, speaks of his boyhood and looking through his telescope. “The experience was truly visceral, shivers ran up and down my spine every time I pointed the telescope at a patch of stars”. How fortunate we are to have had him immigrate from Bulgaria.
Let us hope that the excitement of Astrobiologists such as Sasselov overwhelms the greed of our elite and the gullibility of we the people. Existence is too much superstitious faith in the value of certificates issued by the Federal Reserve. Perhaps Astronomers who just this week showed us pictures of Pluto 3 billion miles away could get the FBI to release tapes showing what hit the Pentagon on 9-11.
Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton practiced reason and 300 years ago battled the church and the unreasonable to bring us the Enlightenment, America, Science even Industrialization. As one might expect today all this must be re-thought. Reason may have led to Science but today Science unfortunately doesn’t lead to reason.
The great power of technology, obedient to money, has built a dangerous orthodoxy controlled by a self-serving elite. The view of the astronomers, and Astrobiologist such as Sasselov is unlike that of our bankers or politicians. Let us hope the astronomers remain independent or find support without tax money. They must not disgrace themselves as the scientists at our National Bureau of Standards did in their “study” of the collapse of Building #7 on 9-11. The Astrobiologists are excited by life, by stars like our sun, planets like earth. How fascinating that some believe things could be better, that earth is only on the margins of the HZ (habitable zone.) Here is a group thinking about our welfare! Seeking a larger earth one with more ocean, more islands (think tropical paradise). Contrast our energy studies as that from British Petroleum with the Astrobiologist’s. They look at the heavens, find a hot star, like our sun. We look below ground. They seek benign conditions, we savor reserves of coal, oil and gas that can be sold. The Astrobiologists have our welfare in mind, the light, the warmth, the fresh water, regenerated oxygen. Our elite ignore all this, consider something else, money! One must buy comfort.
There is no eternal rule we can follow to benefit ourselves. Look at us! How has a society resting on selfish private wealth miraculously produced inexpensive PV panels, selective surfaces, super insulation, low e coatings? Despite these remarkable productions our pitiful culture will not know how to use them (we do invent them only as long as we don’t use them)? Long ago came the bicycle, the window, the clothesline. These innovations are disregarded or misused. Children seldom ride their bikes to school, windows are rarely oriented to admit winter but not summer sun. Clotheslines are replaced by gas or electric dryers. What makes anyone think, that PV panels will be used any better? It is a question of struggle, great effort is required to use man’s wonderful inventions. The Astrobiologist set the stage for reason and our success. Think of young Sasselov peering through his telescope in Bulgaria. We must struggle against superstition. A large number on a check or currency bill is readily believed. A well-insulated roof is forgotten. Reason must triumph over superstition, astronomers and their telescopes have helped before and can again. To benefit from the Astrobiologists we need never reach a new planet, just realize how good this one is. Even if the entire culture can’t be saved enough can use windows, bikes, clotheslines, PV, selective surfaces and low e coatings.",3
Jerry Larsoni,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Life of Super-Earths: How the Hunt for Alien Worlds and Artificial Cells Will Revolutionize Life on Our Planet,Eye-opening,"I found this book tremendously informative, exciting, and satisfying. (I didn't want to just say ""awesome""). I picked it up at the new books section in the library, partly just because it was small; I found the title and the blurbs kind of puzzling, wasn't sure how interested I'd be, but at least it was easy to carry :-|
I've since ordered a copy, even though I don't usually like to buy books any more, especially physical editions-- I don't have room! What a deal: two bucks and change, plus four bucks shipping.

I didn't see ""How the Hunt for Alien Worlds and Artificial Cells Will Revolutionize Life on Our Planet"" (from the cover blurb. The blurb still seems a little incoherent, but I didn't see what the search for exoplanets had to do with the origin of life; now it's very clear.)
Besides being very illuminating, this book is much easier to read and digest than most popular scientific books.

One of the other reviewers said he hadn't known that our planet has been transformed by the life that evolved on it. I knew that, but there are lots of other things I didn't know, or didn't connect or fully grok. This book makes those connections, and shines the light on quite a few things, including the big one, Marconi's question: where the heck are they? Why don't they write, or visit, or why don't we get their TV programs?

First of all, I really didn't get it about ""super-earths"". Those are defined, if I recall, as planets between 2 and 10 times the mass of earth. Until the 90's, when astronomers started discovering exoplanets, I never heard of such a thing; they're not in science fiction. In our solar system, there are no superearths; just three rocky, ""terrestroid"" planets, four giants, and a lot of moons, dwarf planets, and smaller stuff. In other words, Earths, Jupiters, Plutos, moons, comets, asteroids, but no planets bigger than ours except the giants.

In science fiction, it's extremely rare to have an Earth-like planet that's significantly bigger than Earth, no doubt because we don't have any in our neighborhood. I can think of a couple offhand: Jack Vance's Big Planet, and Silverberg's Majipoor, but basically it's just Earths, Jupiters, moons, asteroids and junk. Plus weird stars and black holes, wormholes, stuff like that.

When the super-earths started getting discovered, I thought it was just, well, they're easier to spot because they're bigger, but they're not very interesting. The surface gravity would be too high for us to live on them, not to mention the cost of getting in and out of their gravity wells. (Actually, it's just habit that makes us think we need planets anyway, but that's another story).

Turns out that, while Mars, for example, was apparently too small to retain an atmosphere and develop life, and Earth is just big enough, the super-earths are actually even better. They also all tend to have about the same surface gravity, 1.4G, which might not be insuperable. Of course, we probably won't get to them for quite a while anyway, if ever; the most Earthlike one so far discovered is almost 600 light years away, and even one light-year is a heck of a long way, but these super-earths can tell us a lot about how planets form, and how life evolves.

You need a planet to develop life; every place else is too cold for chemistry to happen, too hot and/or radioactive for chemical compounds to be stable, lacking energy sources.
A planet IS its life and vice-versa; but in principle, and as proved by our lunar expeditions, life can transcend its planetary origins. All this is from the book; I would add that once we leave the planet, we don't need other habitable planets; we can build habitats that provide everything planets did, in space, or maybe on a low-g planet such as Luna.

That point about planets being transformed by the evolution of life implies (though I don't think this is mentioned in the book) that any habitable planet is already inhabited, not necessarily by intelligent life or technical civilizations, but by life-forms, biospheres. We can be pretty sure there are no planets sitting around with oxygen atmospheres and no life-forms, just waiting for us, because oxygen is extremely active, and will combine with other elements, so the only way you have an oxygen atmosphere is if plants keep replenishing it. Now, those plants and animals on any hypothetical inhabited/habitable planet may have different biochemistry than what we're used to; they may be toxic, or hyper-allergenic, or infectious, to us. (That would be very interesting to know, btw. Short of traveling to exoplanets, maybe we'll still be able to learn enough about them to get an idea whether our type of biochemistry is the only possible kind).

Planets also have gravity wells, which makes them hard, or expensive, to get to and get away from. That's true even of Earths, even Marses. Lunas, not so bad.

Of course there's a lot of speculation in the book, but it's very well done and plausible.
So-- what about Marconi and his Question? What I thought up to now was that well, of course we're not the only technical civilization in the universe, but they may be rare and far apart. Billions of stars, yes, and most of them with planets, sure, but it takes a long time (say, four billion years) to construct a solar system, and then another few billion years for life to evolve, and then once you have intelligent life and technology, it still might take a long time to build an interstellar civilization-- and although we tend to assume our species and civilization will last forever, that's probably not true; genus homo is about 2 million years old, language and technology maybe only 50,000. Maybe our species will only last another few million years even if we don't blow ourselves up.
So maybe intelligent species just tend to be separated in time and space.

This book offers another idea. Maybe I shouldn't tell you; if I just give you the bottom line (spoiler alert), it won't have the same impact as if you follow the line of reasoning in the book. But it turns out, with reasonable estimates of how long it takes to form the right kinds of stars, and then develop life, that it's possible we're first! Or, among the first.

There's also some discussion of scales: the quantum scale, where things happen too fast and too weirdly to develop anything as stable as life; the cosmic scale, too big, too slow; and the Goldilocks scale we live on. This book brings together a great many different ideas in a very satisfying way. I can't recommend it too highly.",1

Naked Pagan,3.0 out of 5 stars,AI for Game Developers: Creating Intelligent Behavior in Games,Just a few caveats,"I bought this book because of the chapter O'Riley had on its site (Flocking) and the general experience I have had with O""Riley in the past. While there is plenty to learn from this text, its not for the faint of heart or new programer. There is a lot that needs to be done to get set up for this.

My first issue is that some of the code seems just a little too complex for a beginner. While I respect the features hes trying to put in, it can clutter up the main point of what is happening, and makes learning the basic principles harder.

It seem the writter assumes you read his other book 'Physics for game programer' since he refers to it several times.Download the sample code for the book and you will see what I mean.

Then there is no discussion of the graphic package being used. I tried to do the stuff with GDI+ and ended up switching to DirectX because the flickering was so bad. Some discussion on setting up a test and development enviroment to run these projects on would have been helpful.

Oh and it was written in C+. Okay, no big deal, but a warning would have been nice. I can handle C+, but I do my work now in C#. Since it was written in an OO language, a little back ground on system design would have been helpful too.

Asking too much? While the info there is good, there are a lot of obstacles for a 'beginner' to handle. I'm motivated though, and bought his phyiscs book just to see if it helps out any.",1
Riccardo Audano,2.0 out of 5 stars,AI for Game Developers: Creating Intelligent Behavior in Games,Intelligent agents should steer clear from this book,"Terrible and useless even for a book on AI for budding game developers. The theory and explanations in this book are sometimes decent but more often than not quite lacking. (es: in one of the first chapter the author uses Bresenham algorithm without taking the time to explain it). The use of tile based examples introduce unnecessary overhead, and the continuos attempts to introduce physics related code and references to the author's other book on game physics are just plain annoying. The range of subjects covered is very broad (chasing and evading, pathfinding, emergent behaviours, rule based reasoning, bayesian networks, neural networks, fuzzy logic, finite state machines, genetic algorithms), definitely too broad to treat each of these subject in decent depth and with clarity. Example code is of low quality and just superficially object-oriented. If you are looking for a decent introduction to game AI I recommend Matt Buckland ""Programming Game AI by Example"" and ""AI Techniques for Game Programming"".",34
Michael Valenzuela,4.0 out of 5 stars,Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart,Our computerized approaches to decision making are wrong! This book can help.,"This book contains a collection of essays discussing how intelligent creatures actually make decisions. The book presents a dichotomy of formal/standard approaches (e.g., multiple linear regression) and fast & frugal heuristics. The following comparison is a little unfair, but it should be useful for the less technical readers: traditional AI approaches are like being ""book smart"" and the heuristics discussed and defended in this book are like being ""street smart.""

Let me elaborate. Many standard approaches are radically different from how we, as intelligent beings, think. Many (most) formal decision making algorithms are based on machine learning approaches, which simply process the data, ignoring the data collection task. They are data hungry. Give them the perfect data set and they can break records (or beat players at the game called Go).

Alternatively, the fast and frugal heuristics take into account that information might be hard to come by in the first place. Moreover, these heuristics are much easier to follow in real life. They are based on three simple principles:
(1) Simple search rules,
(2) Simple stopping rules, and
(3) Simple decision rules.
The primary reasons one should care about fast and frugal heuristics is that they:
(A) Are ecologically rational, meaning they can be implemented with limited time, mental effort, and other resources,
(B) In many cases perform as well as more sophisticated algorithms, and
(C) Provide insight into real life intelligences.

The heuristics presented here are not necessarily going to win in top Artificial Intelligence (AI) competitions, but are still surprisingly useful. These heuristics are more biological-like AI.",1
baylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart,"Well, i liked it anyway","Whether you like a book depends on what information you're looking for. i make computer models of human behavior so this book, which is easy to read but filled with concrete solutions and lots of supporting dat, was near-perfect for me
As a note, i'm picky when it comes both to writing and thinking. And i hate most books written by academics. Even the ones with good information (eg, Fodor's Modularity) are hard to read and filled with confusing, field-specific words. Not this book. It's really well written. Written in plain English, very few assumptions, very thorough analysis, lots of self-criticism, lots and lots of data (OK, that part is boring and can be skipped, but it's comforting to know it's there)
What's it about? Common AI, psych and economic decision and learning algorithms (decision trees, neural nets, Bayes, multiple linear regression, etc.) are compared to several absurdly simple algorithms the authors believe real humans use. The various approaches are compared and evaluated on the basis of performance, accuracy on training data, accuracy on test data (generalization) and amount of input data required. Tests are on the standard UC Irvine data learning test sets. Comparisions, outcome explanations and relevance to the human mind and the real world are provided. Explanations and analysises are easy to understand and pretty convincing
i've decided to use a lot of what was in this book in my software, things that have made my agents more natural and easier to implement. i absolutely love this book",66

JF Sebastian,5.0 out of 5 stars,Analysis of Boolean Functions,An excellent exposition of Fourier analysis of Boolean functions,"This book is mostly concerned with Fourier analysis of functions of the form f:{0,1}^n-->{0,1}, known as Boolean functions. These functions play a very important role in theoretical computer science and combinatorics. They are simple, elegant and yet they're expressive enough to capture most problems encountered in these fields.

Ryan O'Donnell, a well-known expert in this area, gives a very accessible and highly motivated exposition of the topic. Indeed, some knowledge of probability theory and linear algebra is enough to get you started. In particular, **no prior knowledge of Fourier analysis is assumed.** Each chapter ends with a highlight section which is an exposé of a usually important result using the techniques covered in that chapter. Already, by the end of the first chapter, the reader can appreciate an application of simple Fourier-analytic notions to the problem of function linearity testing. In later chapters, these highlight sections will consider constant-depth circuits, pseudorandomness, PCPs, the KLL theorem, decision tree complexity and much more. Additionally, in chapter 8, generalizations of Boolean functions to probability product spaces are considered. Finally, the last three chapters contain a wealth of information on hypercontractivity.

Needless to say, this book is highly recommended to students and researchers in theoretical computer science and mathematics. Indeed there is no other book with a scope like this.

An online version of the book is available at

Nonetheless, it's still a good idea to get the print version. There are more exercises for some chapters, expanded notes in some cases plus a much-needed symbol list and, of course, an index!",3
The European,4.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Ethics,Will Homo Sapiens 2.0 be our future?,"The future belongs to AI. This is a statement I think everyone can agree with. The difficult question is: which AI? The optimistic outlook on AI which Ray Kurzweil describes or the pessimistic one of James Barrat?

To find an answer this book might be great help. Machine Ethics is a reader which means different authors present their ideas on how ethics can be implemented to make AI somewhat controllable and human-friendly. (Friendly AI by the way is an expression coined by Eliezer Yudkowski and expresses in an unagitated way the hopes of mindful researchers).

Machine ethics is divided into five parts and gives an overview about the main issues machine ethics is concerned about: nature, importance, concerns, approaches and visions. The editors, Susan Leigh Anderson and Michael Anderson, present here a readable and comprehensive intro into machine ethics.

A great help are the introductions to the different parts where the editors describe in an understandable and interesting way the main ideas of the different articles. Without these introductions it might have been difficult to understand the impact of the numerous articles if the reader is not updated on the ""big"" names within the field. Anderson/Anderson have brought together different views expressed by Drew McDermott, Wendell Wallach, J. Storrs Hall, Steve Torrance, Eric Dietrich to name but a few of the contributors. I personally missed Eliezer Yudkowsky, Nick Bostrom or Bill Hibbard, each of them an authority in the field of AI ethics.

The tenor of the articles is that ethics is necessary and should be in one or the other way be built into any machine with the qualities future AI machines are going to be endowed with. However, since I read James Barrat's ""Our final invention"" at the same time I could not help feeling that Machine Ethics maybe comes a little late and that real time research already has decided against ethics in machines. Especially since almost all research in the end seems to be funded by DARPA (an US defense agency). Still, this is just a personal impression of mine and hopefully it is never too late to get some ethics into the game.

The biggest surprise was the last contribution: Eric Dietrich's Homo Sapiens 2.0 in which the author expresses his hopes that robots will the better humans. This article alone made the book worth reading.

I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in AI and still has a positive outlook and wants to keep it. Machine Ethics is an interesting read and worth while to think about.",1

The math part is fine, but this really isn't a mathematics book, so prior knowledge is required. It covers an astonishing range of machine learning topics, even the algorithms no other book will ever cover. So I'd say, this is a must have book. Is it flawed? Deeply.

This book is not a “cook-book” for Genetic Algorithms, and it does not have any practical examples or code that you can “borrow”. Being an academic book it goes into the theoretical foundations of Genetic Algorithms, it uses a fair amount of mathematics, and it backs up claims and discussions with references to research articles. At times the mathematics gets a little bit complex and you better know something about probability, functions, matrix algebra, vector/matrix notation, and infinite series.

For those who do not know; Genetic Algorithms imitate aspects of the evolutionary process observed in nature to solve engineering problems and scientific problems. As such it can also shed light on the natural evolutionary processes (punctuated equilibria, the Baldwin effect, etc). In Genetic Algorithms you have a genetic representation, for example, a “chromosome” (bit string) and you simulate cross over (chromosome blending), mutations, fitness criteria, etc. Melanie Mitchell describes the use of Genetic Algorithms in scientific models, and how they can be used to simulate and explain evolution in nature, she describes different approaches to Genetic Algorithms, automatic programming, using Genetic Algorithms for prediction, and she explains how to use them to solve problems in Artificial Intelligence/Computer Science, and she also describes how to use them with evolving Neural Networks.

What I liked about the book is that despite the fact that it is only 200 pages it covers a lot of ground. The book is well organized, well written, interesting, and concise. I read this book because I was interested in finding out whether I could use some form of Genetic Algorithm to solve some optimization problems at work. Therefore it might not have been exactly the right book for me. At the same time I found the book to be quite interesting and I liked the learning experience. You should understand Genetic Algorithms before you use them anyway. The book is 16 years old by now, perhaps too academic for some people’s taste, and I believe I found a term that was left out in a derivation, so I’ll give a four star rating, but I enjoyed reading it.",1
JM Gustafson,3.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms (Complex Adaptive Systems),Good Theoretical GA Textbook,"This book primarily deals with the theoretical side of genetic algorithms. If you are looking for practical knowledge of how to implement a GA you should look elsewhere. For all intents and purposes this is a textbook. It's heavy on theory and proofs, but doesn't always explain everything in depth (that's what class time is for). There are problems at the end of each chapter that can be assigned to students.

There are case studies of many academic projects that seem to drone on forever and aren't really that useful in helping you learn how to write your own GA. Chapter 1 gives an overview and provides all of the appropriate terminology. Chapter 5 gives an high-level overview of how to implement a GA. Those are the 2 must-read chapters, all of the others can be used as torture for CS students.

To recap, if you're teaching a class in artificial intelligence this book is good. If you're trying to figure out how to implement a GA to solve a practical problem not so good. That evens out to 3 stars for my rating. I recommend searching the web, there are a few good sites on GA programming.",11
John Dalesandro,3.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms (Complex Adaptive Systems),Not for beginners,"I have an engineering degree, and I found this to be a little tough to follow for two reasons:
1. Not enough step by step prodecure especially at the beginning. Mitchell is too quick to start with the math formulas. It turns out that Genetic Algorithms are fairly straight forward and easy to follow, but you have to read this book twice before you ""get it"" because Mitchell clouds the discussion with proofs and mathematical representations of systems. It is tough to follow.
2. Mitchell does a poor job of selecting meaningful examples to illustrate the points. A nice simple set of examples where the average person easily picture the system would have been delightful. Instead this author chooses to illustrate the Genetic Algorithms through uncommon neural networks amoung other exotic applications. I found myself struggling to understand both the example (I didn't know a thing about neural networks!) and the genetic algorithm.
When buying an Introduction type book, I expected it to be more 'down to earth'. this book is for advanced minds!",35
DvG,1.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms (Complex Adaptive Systems),Don't buy this book...,"This book is NOT an ""Introduction"" to Genetic Algorithms. It is an academia blathering about genetic algorithms citing mostly other people's work with no practical examples. If you are looking to actually get some program code up and running to experiment with genetic algorithms, this is NOT the book to get. If you are a professor searching for a GA book to use in your classes, please do not select this one. Your students will hate your class.
However, if you are looking for a discussion of some variations of genetic algorithm approaches to solving various problems from a higher level perspective, it might be worth a read. I realize this review may seem harsh, but when a book is so completely mis-titled it is misleading. This book is written for people with a thorough knowledge of genetic algorithm use already.",6
W. Collier,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook,Good for narrow focus on perl and testing,"This book is a decent, gap-filling, focused and useful volume on testing perl with the use of the perl Test modules.

About the book:

This is narrowly and tightly focused on testing, and use of the ""Test::"" series of objects and techniques in Perl. It covers basic setups and use, and then expands into using mock objects and the mock modules, which are not covered well, if at all, in other published texts, at least not from the standpoint of being a software tester (as opposed to a coder).

It also shows how to drive and mock-up database testing, and the various ways to go about testing web sites and back-ends with Perl. Finally, it covers Test::Class, which sets up Unit Testing, for those coming from a jUnit or nUnit angle. And it touches on testing from other aspects, such as testing libraries or interactive code.

Criticisms:

I have found that most of the O'Reilly ""Notebooks"" are priced too highly for their small amount of content, and the content is usually very minimal. This book is the one exception I've found in that series.

That being said, I still believe that it should be priced around $20, or perhaps $25. But $5-10 is a minor quibble considering this is the only book of its type (Perl testing).

Another valid criticism is that much of the information in this book can be found spread all over the internet in various places, and some parts can be found in other Perl books. That is true - but ultimately irrelevant. Disparate clusters of information without completeness or context is simply not very valuable when compared to a solid text focused on the subject matter.

Bottom Line:

It is a good compilation and reference for its subject, with a lot of information and context provided, which makes it superior to a collection of links and snippets here and there on the internet.

If you are a Perl coder or a tester, this is a handy book to have on your shelf.",1
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook,"Good material, interesting format","I'm written a lot of perl code, and read a lot of evangelism about testing, but had never done much in the way of actual testing. I was exactly the person for whom this book was intended. And, it worked! The information about testing seems very strong, even authoritative, although since I know little else about it except for what I've learned from this book, I can't say that with my authority of my own. I've read lots of O'Reilly books, but this was my first in the Developer's Notebook series. I don't think it's revolutionary approach or anything, but it does work quite nicely, very focused on the practical, easy to apply immediately. All in all, a very nice book for the situation I was in. If you are in a similar situation, you'll probably like it too.",1
Eric J. Wu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook,Excellent book,"Love this book, excellent intro to Perl testing. One of the few (or only) books on Perl testing out there.

Test::More, Dest::Deep, test_ok, cmp_deeply, is, Devel::Cover, Test::Harness, Mock modules, program testing, testing databases and Apache, and much more.

spudboy100,5.0 out of 5 stars,Your Digital Afterlives: Computational Theories of Life after Death (Palgrave Frontiers in Philosophy of Religion),Your Digital Afterlives- Splending and information rich,"I don't have this book in front of me right now, and it is only 212 pages, but it was worth it (for me) to pay this book's high price. Professor Steinhart applies both physics, and especially, computer science, to demonstrate via logic, rationality, and the example of our ""perfect for existence universe"", to illustrate how we are likely part a bigger, organized system. Steinhart,invokes the copying of information from one life to another (be it multiple worlds or an infinite cosmos) via ""pipes,"" of transmission. The author also uses theologian John Hick's proposal for a re-created replica. In essence, we die, but are resurrected or re-created. If anyone reads the back cover there is a good summary of Professor Steinhart's idea by stating that when we die, we continue to run on more advanced computers, and so on and so forth, for an undetermined time. The book is content rich, and presents many interesting ideas.

If any reader walks away two things to remember about Your Digital Afterlives, it is Promotion and Revision. Revision Theory, from the professors point of view, seems to indicate, basically the idea of Hugh Everett the 3rd's theory based on his interpretation of quantum mechanics, where all humans (specifically) have exact clones in other, closely related universes. Of more encouragement to me, is Steinhart's concept of Promotion, in which the direct passing of information, memory, and personality, from world to world, seems plausible, where as, Revision, is simply a clone, with their own experiences and memory. Thus, the information that we are, sort of perishes permanently. There is a chapter in the books that states that Revision is Promotion, but on this I am not certain. Lastly, there are Steinhart's not of gods, or angels, or operation systems, running each universe-with Digital Afterlives, these are all the same! Ultimately, in this book, the Professor does view an ultimate creator-mind-God, that Steinhart argues is the basic hardware, on which all resides. With Digital Afterlives, it's to paraphrase Carl Sagan, simulations all the way down. I hope my review and comprehension doesn't offend the good, Professor, too much in my review, but this is what I took away. Excellent and inspiring.",9

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fundamentals of Neural Networks: Architectures, Algorithms And Applications",Neural Networks 151. Don't let the math scare you,"I picked up this book as a slightly more advanced and technical introduction to neural networks than the pure applied programming or highly conceptual books out there. Hence the title ""Neural Networks 151"" instead of ""Neural Networks 101"". I was looking for something that provided a detailed, behind-the-scenes look at the theory and structure of neural networks without requiring a PhD in math. This book delivered. While there is a great deal of math, it's actually quite straightforward if you look closely. For the most part, the math is simply a representation of what's contained in the text. Reading the text allowed me to grasp the mathematical equivalent quickly and easily. This is distinct from books which put out 20 equations and only have a few lines of text, leaving you to painfully and slowly work through each equation to figure out what's going on (reaching for other textbooks and lots of coffee along the way). Does it help to have a great deal of mathematical knowledge ? Sure. Is it absolutely necessary ? Not in my opinion. E.g., ""delta x"" simply means ""change in x"". If that sounds familiar or straightforward, the book shouldn't be too difficult. I skimmed sections that weren't totally applicable to the problems I was looking at, but it was good to see the knowledge was there in case I needed to return to it later. It seems geared towards an instructional setting, but not at a 301 level. As an intermediate book that solidified my understanding and knowledge of neural networks, it was perfect.",7

It may be helpful to know some programming and some digital logic, but ""Bebop to the Boolean Boogie"", also by ""Max"", gets you there. You go from the DIY ""virtual"" calculator (residing on your computer) that does NOTHING, and you, with Clive and Alvin as your guides, make it do basic math. Even us ""old"" engineers can have a kick start to the memories of how we used to do things, and may still be doing them today. Added bonus: It is not a dry text book approach. You will have fun doing it.",8

Richard Hammervold,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Intelligent Machines,The Age of Intelligent Machines,This is an awesome book. This was required reading for a Business Class reflecting a future perspective. It can be a little scary as machines become sentient and must take care of mankind as we become their pets. It uses facts from the past to project this potential future state for mankind.,4
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Age of Intelligent Machines,An incredible book,"I read this book only recently, having read the author's two most recent books ""The Age of Spiritual Machines"" and his book ""Kurzweil vs The Critics of Strong AI"". Both are excellent books, and reflect the author's extreme optimism about the future of artificial intelligence. He is definitely one of the best apologists for AI, and documents well its living history. Reading this book after the recent ones gives an interesting comparison between what was real in AI then and what is real now. Indeed, the AI landscape has changed dramatically, and there were a few companies specializing in AI in business at the time of publication of this book, that are not around any longer. But for every company that has failed, there have been many more to take their place. Their character as companies has changed, due in part to the rise of the Internet. In fact, it is network engineering that has resulted in many of the applications of AI in the last 5 years, and those applications of course are not mentioned in this book, due to its date of publication.
The author begins the book with a discussion of what he calls ""The Second Industrial Revolution"", which, he claims, is now in progress, and is based on the rise of thinking machines. These machines will extend and leverage human mental abilities, he says, challenging the human uniqueness in this regard. He expresses caution over the idea of making our military defenses controlled by intelligent machines, at the same time expressing his confidence that machine intelligence will indeed be sophisticated enough for this to happen. This revolution is here he says, will be more radical than the first one, but cannot be stopped, and he encourages therefore the constructive use of its technology. Thus is the author's motivation to write this book: to give the reader an overview of what was possible in AI at the time, and encourage the benevolent use of it.
The author not only discusses the technology of AI, but also attempts to give the reader insight into just what AI is. This entails a discussion of philosophy, since philosophical debate dominated AI in its early years. Such debates are still common, but due to the frequent vituperation involved in them (which the author recognizes and mentions in the book), not much is to be gained from these. Time is better spent on actually trying to build thinking machines, and not engaging in conversations that lead nowhere. Since this book appeared, many philosophers have left their ""arm chairs"" and have joined in the practical research in artificial intelligence. This trend will no doubt continue in this century, thus giving rise to the ""industrial philosopher"".
A fairly detailed history of the field of artificial intelligence is given in the book, with several articles written by some of the more recognized individuals in the field. All of these are interesting reading, and shed light on the different attitudes and prejudices regarding AI. For readers who are new to AI, this will be welcomed, as well as the many discussions on the mathematical foundations of AI and its intersection with cognitive science.
The author refrains from including any mathematical notation or equations in the book, and this has its advantages and disadvantages. It allows a more general readership but sacrifices some of the clarity of thought that mathematics allows. The author does give a good discussion of pattern recognition though, especially edge detection. His discussion on this topic is interesting in that it brings up his demarcation between ""logical"" and ""parallel"" thinking. Logical thinking is referred to as ""sequential"" and ""conscious"", with a resulting limitation in computational ability. It is to be distinguished from parallel thinking which can process multiple levels of abstraction, and can occur without conscious direction. Pattern recognition is in his view an example of the latter, and he justifies this view in the book in some detail. More evidence for his view from laboratory experiments is needed however. Pattern recognition algorithms and technologies have exhibited considerable advance since this book was published.
There have been many advances in AI since the time of publication, due in large measure to the rise of the Internet. Most of these advances have been breathtaking, such as in computer chess, games with imperfect information, Bayesian networks, financial engineering, network intelligence, literary creativity, automatic theorem proving, to name just a few. The author discusses his projections for the future of AI in the book, and it is interesting to compare them with what really came about within the decade later. There is no doubt that more exciting developments are on the way, and the optimism expressed by the author in all of his writings is also characteristic of all who are responsible for these developments. The machines, getting more intelligent with every decade that passes in the 21st century, will bear the signature of these individuals: a tell-tale sign and proof of the genius of the human species.",16

Rod M. Holland,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dynamic Simulations of Electric Machinery: Using MATLAB/SIMULINK,A good book for the power system modeling professional,"I don't think I'd want to try to teach a class from this book. I'd definitely use some material from this for creating labs in Matlab.

I like this book for a reference as a professional. Lots of equations, lots of pictures, lots of functional block diagrams to knit the equations together. However, this book is dedicated to machines, not power systems. Generally for power systems you use a canned model of a generator or motor. This book is helpful for understanding the underlying model, but is not targeted to power SYSTEM simulation.(such as one would do with PSS/E or PowerFactory, or PSCAD). Still I consider it a useful addition to my library when I have to go back and understand the underlying details of the machine.

Overall, the book is very explicit about the code used for all the examples, allowing for easy adaptation to the users' purposes. The exercises at the end of every chapter can be quite challenging, as they often build on concepts presented in the chapter rather than simply reviewing the material.

N/A,5.0 out of 5 stars,AI Techniques for Game Programming (Premier Press Game Development),Perfect for me,"I spent the majority of the time I was reading this book thinking ""This is perfect!"" Just about every other book of this general type that I have read assumes I know things I don't, is a lot thicker than it needs to be, is much too simple, or is really boring. I don't think the author of this book wasted any pages at all. Everything was put forth in a concise, easy to read tone, and whenever I came across something I hadn't seen before, it was explained in short order. At the same time, he does assume that you know what you're doing, C++ programming-wise, so I didn't have to skip past anything I already knew. For what it's worth, this book created a lot of enthusiasm and confidence in me.
The examples in the book are great. Each chapter takes you through a different small project that helps you to understand what is going on, as well as how it can be applied to games. And, as a bonus, the projects are actually interesting! I really got a kick out of showing my versions of them to people. I was able to code each of them myself in a day or two as I went, but the author's full source code and executables are included if you just want to take a look as you read.
If you are already pretty familiar with windows programming, you probably won't need to read the first two chapters, but they answered a lot of questions for me, and really I felt like the author knew what I was thinking. Later on in the book, there is a review of transforms and matrix math that I found to be a really good reference and refresher.
As a side note, the author wanted to title this book ""Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks for Game Programming,"" but his publisher didn't think it was 'snappy' enough. He's very active in the forums on his website, and he and others there have been a great help to me.",6

The first chapter of the book (entitled: Learning and Soft Computing: Rationale, Motivations, Needs, Basics) is 119 pages long. It is an essential reading.

John Michael Albert,5.0 out of 5 stars,Here,The Cover Says It All,"When Szymborska (b. 1923) won the Nobel Prize in 1996, we had View With a Grain of Sand. This survey sampled her work from 1957 to 1993 and firmly supported the wisdom of the Nobel committee's decision. Shortly after, there came Poems, New and Collected, which added about 60 pages of poems from 1957-1993 and 7 poems written between 1993 and 1997. Now, the same translators (Clare Cavanagh and Stanislaw Baranczak) bring us Here. You should be cautioned: this is a facing-page book of translations; its 85 pages of poetry amount to only 42 pages of new poem. As any sane person would expect, these poems are mellower and deeper. There are echoes of ""The Joy of Writing,"" ""Theatre Impressions,"" and ""Under One Small Star,"" poems that I know intimately from reciting them over the last ten years at open-mic poetry readings. I think I would characterize this mellower voice as ""don't worry; things work out."" It's not a blind naivete by any stretch of the imagination. It is the voice of a great poet in her eighth decade, representing a life lived out during a truly bizarre, I'd say self-destructive, century. She says, ekphrastically, ""So long as that woman from the Rijksmuseum / in painted quiet and concentration / keeps pouring milk day after day / from the pitcher to the bowl / the World hasn't earned / the world's end.""

I should have paid more attention to the description.

This book is really more of a ""Grad Student's Guide to Everyday Python Usage"". I imagine it would be very valuable to a mathematics Grad student without too much programming or shell experience, looking for an alternative to Matlab. However, there is very little ""Computational Science"" in this book. Do NOT expect a cookbook of high performance algorithm implementations.

The book is a very verbose 700+ pages, all in an unexciting academic LaTeX format. The author works through idiom after idiom for accomplishing different tasks in fairly stand-alone sub-sections without much of a feeling of conceptual ""flow"" between them. It sort of feels like reading through the author's personal lab notes that he took everytime he learned a new language feature or trick.

If you are an experienced programmer, you will quickly get impatient with the verbose presentation that emphasizes idioms and examples instead of fundamental concepts and syntax reference tables. But, if you are an experienced programmer, you are not the target audience for this book.

Antonio,2.0 out of 5 stars,Algorithms of the Intelligent Web,"Not a bad book, but unable to recommend","I was disappointed with this book and unfortunately cannot recommend it to other readers. From my perspective there are a number of key flaws. The first is that the explanations are fairly short and also rely on the reader having a certain amount of prerequisite knowledge. I'm already somewhat familiar with machine learning, so I understood the topics however I think people who are new to the field and don't have some background in mathematics and statistics will struggle.

The second problem with the book is that each topic is only covered very briefly and in not much depth, so even if you understand their discussion perfectly you are only going to be left with a basic introduction.

I was hoping to use this book to get some additional insights into various machine learning topics and familiarize myself with python tools for machine learning. Although this book does include python code and what I saw wasn't bad, it isn't a very detailed or comprehensive look at the use of python in machine learning. I've looked at a few python machine learning books and they all seem to be just not very good.

In summary while I wouldn't say this book is bad, it simply lacks the kind of detailed explanations a beginner would need and lacks the depth that would appeal to more advanced learners. The thing to realize is that vast majority of these topics are not new and have been around for decades. For those looking for an explanation of the theory it is well covered in existing textbooks in statistics and data mining. For those looking at how to use python for machine learning, you would be better off reading an introduction to python textbook and then doing some online tutorials on tools such as matplotlib, sklearn etc. Another alternative would be to consider learning R as well, there are quite a few decent textbooks that use R, and then later transition to python.

Some useful books are

James, Witten et al. An Introduction to Statistical Learning (great introduction that uses R)

Witten. Data Mining: Practical machine learning Tools and Techniques (another good introduction that uses their own Java tools)

Kuhn. Applied Predictive Modeling (a good intermediate text that uses R. Read after the James, Witten et al. book)

Kelleher. Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics. (good but basic introduction)

Flach. Machine Learning (a decent introduction to theory, again not very mathematical. Doesn't use any particular tool)

Pang-Ning Tan. Introduction to Data Mining (decent introduction to the theory of data mining if you want more depth or another perspective. Not especially mathematical. Again this is more theory it doesn't use any particular tool)

I didn't mention them here, but there are a great many decent statistics textbooks on topics such as multivariate analysis, regression modeling, bayesian analysis etc that contain valuable material also. In addition there are good online introductory courses such as that by Andrew Ng.",1

In the book's three sections (""Basics"", ""Principles"", and ""Applications""), Spitzer's lucid writing describes neural networks, current concepts in learning, how cortical organization relates to networks, and many specific examples which describe how research is illuminating the challenging topic of how the mind works.
His illustrations complement the text perfectly, he cites references as needed, he provides a glossary of the terms he uses, and his index provides quick access for review.

Joshua G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Pattern On The Stone: The Simple Ideas That Make Computers Work (Science Masters Series),"the best CS0 book, but not free from problems","Honestly, the best CS0 book out there. Not really any detail on binary or assembler programming, but the students will get that in Architecture and/or OS. Much more understandable than other CS0 books for the average incoming CS major (I've taught at several schools from regional comprehensives to small private liberal arts colleges to R2s & R1s), and it's an INCREDIBLE book for non-majors, because I teach a version of CS0 for them, too. There are some parts where Danny Hillis kind of goes off the rails, but they're minor:
- He asserts that the brain was ""designed"" by evolution, which is a gross misunderstanding of evolution, and I do worry about that kind of thing with impressionable college freshman
- He calls an infinite recursion an ""infinite loop""
- He says things like ""only one of the registers in the memory is access at a time, but that's PER CONCURRENT INSTRUCTION
- He refers to Alonzo Church as ""one of Turing's contemporaries"", rather than as Alan Turing's PhD advisor
Stuff like this is not really all that important to students, and correctness can be debated, but it's a symptom of the only problem with the book, which is that Hillis goes up and down in terms of level of detail with which he explains things, and he does so either randomly or with a pattern I don't understand.

Why am I giving it five stars if it has problems? Look at other CS0 books. They have more problems, and they're on average about TEN TIMES AS EXPENSIVE. Hillis gives so much bang for the buck that I don't care. When it's important, I note it in class.",3

John Smith,3.0 out of 5 stars,Programming in Prolog: Using the ISO Standard,Dissatisfied,"Pros:
- Even someone with no programming or math knowledge could pick up the book, read it, and learn Prolog
- Uses ISO-Prolog
- Large section of helpful example programs

Big Cons:
(I'll give citations, only from the first 100 pages to keep things short, lest anyone think I am lying about the problems with the book)
- Frequent syntax errors *in program statements* - in Prolog, every comma and period is absolutely essential, when they are missing it entirely changes the meaning of the statement - the book misses them pretty routinely (p 81, twice)
- Frequent logic errors - in Prolog, the order of facts and rules is extremely important. The book commonly mixes things up, presenting you with programs that will not work (p 56 - note here that they are trying to give an example of what will/won't work, and they get it backwards)
- Frequent editing/formatting errors - charts, diagrams etc are fairly often on the wrong page or in the wrong location, etc. (p 48)
- Poor organization - looking through the table of contents, you would think the book is extremely well organized, but as you read it, you'll find new and important ideas thrown into random sections - if you forget something, and need to find it later, you'll probably need to re-skim the entire book. Things are almost never presented in convenient bullets/numbering, almost always in paragraph form, again, making essential ideas tedious to find.
- Confusing - I have degrees in math and computer science, and have been programming for 15 years, and I still found parts of the book hard to follow - note that it had nothing to do with Prolog itself, which is actually very straightforward, but rather with the explanations given, which sometimes seem meandering and poorly worded.
- A really short and crummy index makes things hard to find. For example, look up ""atoms"", a concept first mentioned on page 26, and routinely mentioned afterwards, a concept absolutely essential to understanding Prolog - the index shows that the first (and only) time it appears is on page 123.

Average Cons:
- Authors use an ""arrow system"" to trace Prolog decision making, I think a table system (which could easily show previous, current, and future steps, and details of each iteration) would have been better while presenting more information in a clearer fashion.
- Code re-use - normally a good thing, frustrating in this book. You might have a rule (like a function) called ""mother(X)..."" early on in the book, not use it for 100 pages, and then it appears again. If you want to try the program out yourself, you'll need to know the exact definition of ""mother(X)..."". There's no way to find what page the function was on in the index or TOC, so you find yourself spending 30 minutes leafing through the book to find it. 99% of these are a single line of code, so there's really no need to reuse them, it's hardly saving any space.
- Overly complex examples - sometimes the authors illustrate an idea with 20 lines of code, when 4 would have been sufficient. It makes for a lot of extra reading and deciphering.

Small Cons:
- (This could be a pro or con - since I don't know too many people who *start* their programming experience with Prolog, I assume the reader has some experience with programming, and so list this as a con) Book is far too detailed for someone with moderate programming or math experience. This helps some people, but makes it a tedious read for others. Every concept is thoroughly explained. If you're a programmer, this gets a little old during things like variables and recursion. If you know any math, verbose explanations of predicate logic will become tiresome. In fairness, it was no doubt the authors' intention to make a ""complete"" introduction to Prolog, and so it is hard to criticize this.
- (Another pro/con, depending on the reader) British examples - the authors are British (or at least one of them is), and use British references in their code all the time (9th century princes of Wales, p 34; horses who won races in Britain in 1927, p 53) - if you're British this might break up the monotony and make things a little more interesting, if you're not, it just gets a little old, I'd rather see every example just use ""cat"",""dog"",""mouse"".

Other:
- NOT a good reference book (and it wasn't meant to be), if you know Prolog already and need a reference book, look elsewhere. This is for people who do not know Prolog.

Conclusion:
- I wish I bought a different book. BUT despite everything, I did adequately learn Prolog from this book, so will reluctantly give it 3 stars.",45
M. Marquardt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming in Prolog: Using the ISO Standard,Highly Recommended,"Programming in Prolog is a clear, precise introduction to Prolog from the ground up.

While is does start with the basics, it is an incredibly thorough text, covering all minutia of the language. The text is clear, easy to understand, and to the point, moving quickly through topics without sacrificing understanding.

I used this book as a supplementary text in an upper-division college course. After reading only the first four chapters, I knew things about the language that the instructor did not.
I highly recommend this book to any programmer of any skill level that is interested in learning the Prolog programming language.

Additionally,

OregonCoast,4.0 out of 5 stars,Building Natural Language Generation Systems (Studies in Natural Language Processing),A worthy introduction to NLG (natural language generation),"Summary: Reiter and Dale provide a useful introduction to NLG.
Review: This book is probably the first of its kind. Although there has been considerable work in natural language summarization, research in producing natural language is in its infancy. The authors draw upon actual NLG systems to illustrate the techinical issues involved. They are careful to point out that NLG may not be the best solution for the reader's practical problems. For instance, human writers might produce better text, or mail-merge programs might do the job (albeit with lower quality) at a significantly lower price. A shortcoming -- perhaps a necessary one -- is that the authors hesitate to describe research and development trends for the past decade. The reason does not appear to be a shortage of the quality and quantity of NLG R&D, because the authors do analyze trends for the 1970's and the 1980's. Are the authors hesitant to criticize their contemporary colleagues? A blunt trends analysis would have been helpful, particularly for readers new to the field.",25
N/A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Digital Arithmetic (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Architecture and Design),A good book by a good Professor,"I had taken the course ""Digital Arithmetic"" under Prof. Ercegovac in UCLA and had used the draft version of this book. Professor Ercegovac is extremely knowledgable and well-known in his area and I was amazed at how quickly he was able to answer all our doubts.
Now about the book. I have not read any other book on this subject except this one. So, keep that in mind while considering my review. This book is about efficient algorithms for arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, etc and the ciruits for realizing these algorithms. The book deals with circuits at a high black-box level, so you don't have to be an expert in low-level circuits (in fact, it hardly needs any electrical enginering knowledge). I found the book to be pretty good. First the organization. The book starts with a brief review of various number systems, etc. I was pleasantly surpised to know that apart from the decimal, binary, n-ary number systems, we have what are called redundant number systems, etc. It was also fascinating to know how different number systems had different tradeoffs which made one number system better for certain operations (for eg. redundant number system is good for multiplication) but maybe not for other operations. Then the book discusses two-operand addition techniques. By the first few pages of the this chapter, you would have covered simple schemes like ripple carry adder, carry-save adder, etc which are normally covered in undergraduate computer architecture courses. Then the chapter discusses various other schemes for two operator addition. The next chapter deals with multioperand addition, which as the name implies, discusses different techniques for adding more than two operands. It is very amazing to see the authors use very clever tricks to reduce the complexity of the circuits needed to realize the operations. The later chapters discuss the more complicated operations of multiplication, division, square roots, etc. There is also a chapter on serial arithmetic. These later chapter may be a bit difficult to understand if you are planning to study them on your own and if you don't have much background in this area.
Overall, I found the book to be excellent. It has plenty of figures to explain the concepts and a number of exercises to test your understanding. The only minus point I found was that some sentences in the text were confusingly framed. This might be expected because the authors are not native English speakers. But, then I had used the draft version and I have been told that the print version is much better having gone through the editing phase. To conclude, after taking the course (with this textbook), I came out totally amazed by the fact that there is so much more to know than we can imagine about the ""everyday operations"" of addition, multiplication, etc.",14

What I liked about this book is the broader treatment of topics through the discussion sections. It presents a review of the criticisms and shortcomings in a scholarly and vivid narrative. Furthermore, it presents suggested readings following the discussions which I find very useful for researchers and scientists who find themselves interested in certain segment of the book.

Other thing I liked about the book is that the author presents his own view in the last chapter of the book after reviewing the other views in the preceding chapters. So the author has his own research program but I don't think it affected or manipulated the presentation of other research programs.

Though the title suggests that it is an introductory text and thus accessible to laymen, I don't believe so. It not a matter of hardness, but it just takes time to follow up.

After reading this book you'll have a feeling for the major problems and the vocabulary associated with their solutions. If you have any formal AI background you should skip this book.

Anecdotal Description: I would say this book is clearly rooted in the pre AI winter era with a major slant towards strong AI. It is largely silent on the recent big data weak AI machine learning movement. (If that is meaningful to you I'd look at a different book.)

Next Steps / Alternatives: If you accept my premise about the books contents I'd suggest considering three additional or alternative books.
- Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: Second, Enlarged Edition is similar but in much greater depth for those who are primarily interested in the computer science angle to AI.
- Artificial Intelligence: A Philosophical Introduction is also a ""kick back and flip pages"" style book for those more interested in the philosophical angle on AI.
- For those interested in the cognitive science angle I'm less confident on a recommendation but I've heard good things about The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind

- Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp Pure gold for those interested in actually building strong AI and anyone interested in Lisp.
- Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition) A recently updated classic, deserving of its status as the gold standard but a tedious textbook read.
- Artificial General Intelligence (Cognitive Technologies) (Full disclosure I'm reading this one now so this is an incomplete opinion...) This is really the odd man out and belongs somewhere between these two lists. Unlike Norvig's book and like those on the first list read this book leaning back and flipping the pages. That said it is a good bit more advanced than anything on the top list. It is very current and a great refresh on the fundamentals for those with some background.

Bottom Line: If you are totally new to AI and looking for a quick place to start I'd recommend this book.",4

On the other hand, it's a more easily consumable presentation than the original papers... so if not for the fact that there are better tutorials out there, this booklet would come in handy.",1
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Commonsense Reasoning, Second Edition: An Event Calculus Based Approach",A clear overview of the subject,"Occupying the time of many researchers over four decades, the goal of developing a machine that can reason in many different domains is finally reaching fruition. Progress in machine intelligence up until the last few years has been limited to abilities in a single domain, such as chess, checkers, backgammon, medical diagnostics, network management, and so on. Many researchers have held that the only way to eliminate this domain-specificity is to enable commonsense reasoning in machines. Humans of course can think in many domains. A chess master for example can also be a good writer or a good network engineer, and this is the case since any common elements in chess, writing, or network engineering can be recognized and exploited by humans. The integration and automation of commonsense reasoning in machines is challenging, but in this book an approach is outlined that has shown promise. The book of course is targeted to specialists and students in artificial intelligence, but it could also be accessible to cognitive psychologists, linguists, mathematicians, and others who are interested in the subject matter. The book is not only a theoretical discussion, for it discusses and points to practical tools that can be downloaded and used by the reader to illustrate the main issues in the book.

As the author defines it in the first paragraph of the book, commonsense reasoning as a process that takes information about a particular scenario and then makes inferences about other aspects of this scenario based on general knowledge of how the world operates. He discusses the main issues that arise in commonsense reasoning, such as the need for representing commonsense knowledge, the ability to reason about events, some of which may be concurrent or nondeterministic, and how to deal with space. Of particular importance in this discussion is the `commonsense law of inertia', which essentially makes the ""intuitive"" point that things will say the same unless they are affected by an event. However, this law is ""violated"" in many cases, the author discussing a few of these, and so a system for commonsense reasoning must be able to `release' certain `fluents' from this law.

Central to the book is the construction of the `event calculus', which is a system for representing commonsense knowledge and for implementing three types of reasoning abilities, namely `temporal projection', `abduction', and `postdiction.' The fundamental notion of course is the `event', which is an action taking place in the world. Also fundamental is the notion of a `fluent' that represents a property in the world that varies with time. All knowledge is represented declaratively in the event calculus, in order that it can be implemented in the logic programming paradigm, and it is based on a `many-sorted' extension of first-order predicate logic. Also central to the event calculus is the `timepoint' which represents an instant in time. The `discrete event calculus' is a version of the event calculus where the timepoint is restricted to the integers. Both of these systems are axiomatized early on in the book. Of particular interest and very important to commonsense reasoning is the notion of nonmonotonic reasoning and the accompanying notion of circumscription. That commonsense reasoning must be at times nonmonotonic is obvious, since certain premises held at one time may have to be altered when new information presents itself at a later time.

The event calculus is a particular formalization of commonsense reasoning, and for this to work over more than one domain it is necessary to describe formally the notion of a domain. The author calls this a `domain description' and he endeavors to make it as flexible or ""elaboration tolerant"" throughout the book in order that the event calculus is able to handle novel situations as they arise.

The extensive discussions and characterization of the event calculus throughout the book, as well as the examples and extensive references that are given, give the reader a solid understanding of it. Many of the concepts in the event calculus are similar to ones that are found in the other systems of artificial thought. One of these is the `triggering' of events, which is used in discrete event simulation for example, and where an event occurs if a particular condition becomes true. Events whose occurrence depends on something happening are of course very common in the real world, and any effective implementation of commonsense reasoning will have to deal with them. The challenge is to design a system that does not require all the pre-conditions be put in by hand. The axioms for triggering, along with the reasoning patterns that are used by the machine (prediction, abduction, and postdiction), should be sufficient for dealing with events that are contingent on other actions taking place. If they had to be anticipated individually, the number of statements to this effect would proliferate beyond measure, making the commonsense reasoning system extremely brittle and useless. In addition, and the author discusses this in some detail, repeated triggering must be suppressed. This is accomplished by incorporating additional trigger and effect axioms in the system.

The most interesting issue discussed in the book concerns the implementation of the mental states of `agents' in the system of commonsense reasoning. It is in this discussion that the author first introduces the concept of an agent, which he defines as an entity that engages in purposeful actions in the world. An agent can have beliefs, which can be true or false; goals, which the agent wants to be true; and plans, which are a collection of actions that the agent performs in order to reach a goal. The author formalizes these notions he gives examples. But it is when he discusses emotions that things get very complicated, for he introduces 78 axioms that he believes are needed for implementing the Ortony-Clore-Collins emotion theory. He does not discuss whether or not these axioms are independent, and from a simplicity standpoint the implementation would be more believable if the number of axioms were a lot less than the ones that are required in the book.",16

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Modeling Brain Function: The World of Attractor Neural Networks,Of historical importance,"The study of the physics of the brain from the standpoint of dynamical systems was very popular during the 1980's. The theory of chaotic dynamical systems, and the accompanying concepts of strange attractors, horseshoe maps, and fractal basins of attraction was the subject of intense research at that time. It was inevitable perhaps that these theories would be applied to the understanding of the brain, given the dynamical nature of the neuronal synapse. This book, published in 1989, gives a good overview of what was known at the time. It could be read by anyone with a background in dynamical systems and some elementary knowledge of brain biology. The mathematics is also straightforward in that the author does not bring in any of the heavy tools from differential topology or measure theory, which is normally done in discussions of dynamical systems.

There are some points made in the book that must be understood by the reader because the author feels that they are needed to build a successful model of the brain. For example, he discusses the notion of an `input system', which is a system that, for each input, produces and output with the same ""status."" Cognitive discrimination must be used at the input level, if one is to avoid the use of the `homunculus' (the little external observer), for distinguishing between ""good"" and ""bad"" outputs. The major task in the author's view is to produce ""exceptional"" input-output relations, i.e. relations that correspond to intuitions about cognitive processes. A successful brain model, i.e. one that is able to incorporate memory, should be able to distinguish between stimuli that are familiar from those that are to be submitted to the brain for processing or learning. Thus the model must avoid the use of what the author calls `spontaneous computations', which require an external observer (the homunculus again) to interpret the relation between the input and the output. The author gives an example of a system that performs only spontaneous computations early on in the book. Hence the author proposes the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to avoid the occurrence of spontaneous computations. An ANN organizes stimuli in association classes represented by an attractor, and all the stimuli in a particular class are associated with the attractor to which they flow. The author feels that ANNs are more adept at respecting the requirement that for mental computations, which are essentially operations on temporal sequences of data, some record of the initial input sequence must be carried along on a parallel channel, in order to provide the outcome with specific ""meaning"" and a correspondence to the assigned task.

These considerations on the dependence of the processing on the initial input motivate the author to discuss the role of ergodicity in the dynamics of the neural systems of the brain. As the author shows, any generic system subjected to noise will be ergodic, so that eventually the system will access each of its possible states in a manner that is completely independent of the initial state. The author points out two ways in which ergodicity can be avoided: one is to assume that the network is noiseless, and thus only certain moves are allowed from each vertex; the other is to assume that `cooperative phenomena' is present. Since the first possibility is rather exceptional, the author chooses the second, and gives detailed discussion on how cooperative behavior can arise in ANNs. One interesting, and ubiquitous example that he discusses for cooperativity as an emergent property is the Ising model. Mathematically, the breaking of ergodicity involves the taking of the thermodynamic limit, and a necessary condition for emergence is this context is the asymptotic degeneracy of the eigenvalues. To illustrate how this is done, the author uses the solution of a master equation that characterizes the probabilities of making transitions from one state to another in the system.

In order to build a credible model of the neuronal processes of the brain, the author is aware that such a model has to be able to deal with input in the form of temporal sequences, and not just single patterns. He devotes an entire chapter to this in the book, motivating his discussion with the notion of a `central pattern generator' (CPG). The simplicity of CPGs is a concern and the author is aware that such simplicity does not exist in models of cognitive processes. Nevertheless the modeling of CPGs using neural networks can add credence to the program to model general brain processes in terms of neural networks, complex as they can be.

One of course must be able to deal with both the storage and the retrieval of temporal sequences. After discussing some of the early research dealing with these needs, the author then reviews a strategy for dealing with temporal sequences that involves the notion of a `quasi-attractor', which is a network state that acts like an attractor for a short period of time. Quasi-attractors are used to delay the transfer of information out of the attractor. Thus the transitions are governed by synapses that have a time delay. The influence of a pre-synaptic neuron through these synapses will arrive later than the influence coming through a `stabilizing' synapse. The latter type of synapse arises because of the `stabilizing' term in the network model that ensures that if the network is in a state that is identical to a stored pattern then the network will remain there. The author shows how the network can use these delayed transitions to deal with temporal sequences in a manner that is acceptable, i.e. in a way that the `cognition time' is of the order of magnitude of the delay. The author discusses an example dealing with the counting of chimes, in order to give credence to his constructions. In this example it is seen that the network resides in each of the quasi-attractors for a long enough time so as to allow the output neurons to identify the cognitive event.",17

Dave Mark,5.0 out of 5 stars,AI Game Programming Wisdom 3 (AI Game Programming Wisdom (W/CD)),"A fantastic ""a la carte"" tool kit","Being in the game development business, I am always on the lookout for new and different tricks, techniques and strategies. When most programmers go to the lectures, panels and roundtables at the Game Developers Conference, we are looking to pick up this same sort of material... we share ideas and approaches - but rarely get the chance to get down to the code details to make it easy for us to implement those ideas into our own work. This book makes that possible.
Along the lines of the other ""Gems"" series of books, this collection is filled with ACTUAL techniques and code chunks that are used by some of the top professionals in the industry. Just flipping through the list of the contributors to the book is like going around the room at one of the AI roundtables at the GDC... in fact, Steve Woodcock and Neil Kirby are 2 of the ""3 AI guys"" that RUN those roundtables! (The 3rd being Eric Dybsand who has contributed to the ""Gems"" series but not this title.)
Many books on game development are informative. This one is actually USEFULL. I have personally adopted Steve Rabin's source code from the section ""Implementing a State Machine Language"" into my own game and it has saved me many hours of development and improved the readability and understandability of my code for the rest of the team. Just that section alone has netted at least a 1000:1 return on the cost of this book. Other sections have given me a different approach on how to handle the economic strategy layer that I could have come upon myself... but was able to implement a lot quicker than if I had done it myself. It was definately worth the price.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The New Shop Class: Getting Started with 3D Printing, Arduino, and Wearable Tech",An Important Book - For Makers and Education Policy Makers,"I just finished reading The New Shop Class by Joan Horvath and Rich Cameron. This is an important book. Given all of the recent interest in making, and in related technologies like 3d printing, this book is very helpful to those who are looking for guidance in how to get started, and where to go for information. I read The New Shop Class on my Kindle. In the Kindle version there are links to helpful resources, and it was very easy to click on the links to research more deeply into the areas addressed in the book. I really appreciated this feature.

Regarding 3d printing, Horvath and Cameron provide detailed description and explanation of the 3d printing processes that currently exist, as well as the materials needed, and safety and cost issues. As they mention in the book, there is a steep learning curve involved in 3d printing. However, The New Shop Class is very helpful in providing ample resources for finding the answers that will help newbies.

The New Shop Class also discusses the rise of makerspaces and hackerspaces that are opening around the country. The book points out that many of these spaces are being opened in libraries and museums. If you are at all interested in learning how to do this stuff, you will find the direction given in the book regarding makerspaces and hackerspaces invaluable! Starting in 3d printing, I ran into several roadblocks that would have been very difficult to get around if not for the help I received from people at places like these.

The discussion regarding makerspaces and hackerspaces leads to another question implied by the book: Why are public schools and education policy makers not embracing this movement? I have been teaching in the Los Angeles area for over thirty years. In that time I have seen the closing of almost all of the shop classes and industrial education courses in the second largest educational institution in the country, and I know this has been a pattern in most of the school districts in the state of California. Now there is a movement in which students can learn STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math; some folks add art into the mix, calling it STEAM) subjects by actually doing, and they can do this safely and relatively cheaply, and in a way that is accessible to all students. Yet, rather than enacting state or district mandates to incorporate STEM and STEAM into the curriculum through making, it seems that it is up to individual teachers to incorporate these methods of learning by making in their individual classrooms, or it is left to the few motivated and knowledgeable parents who do this to enrich their own children's education.

Read The New Shop Class. You will find it to be an excellent resource!",5

After exploring the properties of ordinary turtle graphics, turtle graphics are tried on the surfaces of spheres and cubes, then on more complicated surfaces. Little by little, concepts of non-Euclidean geometry are introduced, until the final chapters in which the turtle is used to demonstrate the geometric nature of gravity in Einstein's general theory of relativity.

ScottH108,4.0 out of 5 stars,Network+ Guide to Networks (Network Design Team),"Good for exam, so-so for education","Unlike many of the reviewers in this thread, I actually found this textbook to be a very useful guide in studying for the 2009 edition of the CompTIA Network+ exam. Admittedly, it was not completely adequate in and of itself; I supplemented with computer-based practice tests (another reviewer has already named names ;-), and would not have fared as well on the exam without them. At the same time, I don't think there's a textbook out there that can substitute for a good set of practice exams, nor for live, human-to-human instruction. IMHO expecting a textbook to provide 100% of what you'll need to pass a fairly complex 90-minute professional exam is a little naive.

As for the book's readability and accuracy, I agree with some of what has been said. The style is awfully dry and there is a tendency to just dump reams of details. On the other hand, reams of details is what the CompTIA exams are about, so I can't totally fault the author for this. I ran across a handful of technical errors, but fewer than I've found in a lot of other IT textbooks. Maybe there's some errors I missed -- I'm fairly new to the networking end of IT (I'm a former programmer) -- but seeing as I also had the sample tests and a live college course to compare with, I don't think I missed a huge number.

After reading the _Network+ Guide to Networks_ cover-to-cover, completing an in-person companion course, and doing about half of the aforementioned sample topic tests, I passed the Network+ exam with a score of 870/900. It worked for me, maybe it will work for you!",5

Okay, you expect the reading to be dry but this was mega boring and a chore to read. After four chapters I stopped reading this book and picked up the Net+ Passport by Mike Meyers. I found his book much more practical, focused and a surprisingly a good read. The Passport book stays on topic and feeds you the critical info you'll need to know for the test minus the extra fluff. I read Net+ Passport in two weeks and passed the Net+ with a score 801.

Don't get this poorly written text book. The author clearly isn't focused on the main object- obtaining the knowledge to pass the Net+ exam but just covering general topics. Save yourself money and time get the Net+ Passport book",3

J. A. Griffin,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence,"Thought-provoking, but un-even","In this nearly twenty year old book, the author contends that advancing technology and the force of economic competition will lead inevitably (and in a span of mere decades) to a world in which machine intelligence vastly exceeds human intelligence. In chapters 3 through 6 the author gives a fascinating look at some of the possible features of that transhuman, post-biological world. Those chapters are as interesting and thought-provoking as any that have appeared in more contemporary treatments. Where the book does show it age, however, is in the first three chapters. There the author reviews the history of computer technology, and then succumbs to the shop-worn refrain of many classical AI researchers - ""If only we had a computer that is 100 (or 1000 or 10000) times as powerful as today's machine, then we could program a human-equivalent intelligence"". He even predicts on page 23 that ""a general-purpose robot usable in the home"" will be available within ten years. Well, today we have the computer power he was hoping for and still no general-purpose robot. Bottom line: if you want a fascinating look at what a world with superintelligent machines might be like, then buy this book and start reading at chapter 4.

Is the book always an easy read? No, not for me.

Can it be fruitfully read? Yes. I have no ""formal"" education and this is the first book I've actively read about the topics it treats. Chapters on regular expressions (, properties of regular sets), and finite automata have been superb. I'm only on chapter three and have already bought a second copy of it so that I can have one on hand at work.

If you enjoy reading The Art of Computer Programming or other books as detailed as that one, you'll also enjoy this book. If you've read or do go read) portions of The Art of Computer Programming, don't feel like you've gained anything from it and thought its approach esoteric / too hard, this book's not for you.

Hasan Al-Sheboul,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation (2nd Edition)",Want an Advanced? Get the First Edition of 1979,"My first exposure to Automata Theory backs to 1992, as a senior undergrad textbook for that course, which was mandatory and a prerequisite to the Compilers Course. (No student could take them together). Although I got the highest grade among over 80 students, but I was not getting enough comprehension from the class, as it should be. I admit it was due to the complexity and sophistication of that text, since this was the first course that 100% dedicated to computational theory; taking into account it is BS in Computer/COMPUTATIONAL Science.

In my MS work, the required text was By Sipser, but the instructor was giving material that was from Hopcroft/Ullman 1979 text. It was the definitive resource, period.

I purchased the 2nd Ed, 2000, Hopcroft/Ullman/Mitwani; it was simpler than the 1st Ed. and easy going. My focus, and all Professors and researchers whom I know who work in a related-area, have this exact edition as a reference when needed!

Chapter Contents and Material Exhibits
The chapters are relatively not big in text but are very-rich in contents, that sometimes, if this is your first read/exposure to Automata theory, then perhaps you may need to read each section more than one time. If you're reading the text in deep, and in chapter 4+, you would really have a full enjoyment of how the authors are going with their exploring the ideas, with motivation. This is not my first text that I read by Ullman, Hopecroft, and Aho, especially, their older texts; their writings are just ""amazing.""

Exercises
Try to solve the exercises but not at once. Perhaps the exercises can be divided into 4 categories
1. Simple ones
2. moderate (average), that mayhap need to scratch your brain
3. difficult (beyond average), but not challenging, they are just doable.
4. challenging --> I didn't solve all of this category. They are few.

An Advice: some of the exercises in early chapters might be easier to do once you read the later chapters. This is due in part that the way you are making progress in the material, and another, some depend on and only ""ideas"" that are explored in later chapters.

Errata
I've searched the Internet looking for a (maintainable) Errata list, but there's no one. The text has some typos, and otherwise very minor that you could easily spot. I'll mention some:
One of the, perhaps, typos, is in on of the examples related to the conversion between NFAs to DFAs. Another one also in an example to the PDAs, but don't remember exactly.

The Bottom Line
If you are going to have some future work in Automata and Computational theory, you may grab the 3rd Ed. and/or 2nd Ed. to star with, but for sure you should have the 1st Ed. at your disk; it's a ""PRIMER.""",5

Rohar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Monte Carlo Methods in Statistical Physics,The best Monte Carlo book ever,"This book is clearly written, well-organized and very user-friendly. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Monte Carlo methods.

Unlike many other books that focus on its applications, this book spends the first three chapters on a thorough explanation of the mechanism: how Monte Carlo methods work, Markov chain, detailed balance, ergodicity, and on how to measure their efficiency. The book is clear and thorough as it makes sense to an average physics student. However, it may not be so rigorous from a mathematician's viewpoint.

I particular like this book for its down-to-earth style. When the authors talk about an algorithm, they give their self-contained C/C++ code (beautifully written programs), and explain underlying principles, technical details as well as common pitfalls (e.g., random number generators), which are all very helpful.

The topics in this book are clearly physics-based, with a focus on Ising model and other related models. Many important topics are covered: cluster move, renormalization method, entropic sampling, tempering, etc.

However, I kind of feel that the lattice models may not deserve so much attention. One reason the authors choose to do so is perhaps that these models are so simple and so much fun. On the other hand, applications to molecular systems are not mentioned at all (well, most people prefer molecular dynamics instead of Monte Carlo for molecular systems anyway). So I should say that an average person interested in chemistry and biology may prefer some other books, e.g., Frenkel's book. But what you get from this book is a deep and enjoyable understanding, and you may not care about applications too much at the end. I should also mention that the book uses some nice (kind of like plastic) papers, which may feel a little weird at first.",7

Thomas Wikman,4.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++,An in depth Neural Network Cookbook,"This book is a little dated and it shows. However, I still read it and it is still a valuable read because it is a very practical Neural Network Cookbook. I read it because I intended to implement a Neural Network and embed it directly in unmanaged C++ code at work. The Neural Network Toolbox from Mathworks was not directly applicable to us, so for our task this book was useful. I should say that in the end we did not implement our algorithms this way but that is a different story.

This book was written at a time when Neural Network research was really hot. It was only seven years earlier that Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams (1986) had published a revolutionary paper that would get Neural Network research going and literally exploding. Therefore the book is written with enthusiasm and a sense that Neural Networks is what is best for most any complex problem in computing, which I cannot agree with. The code presented is the old unmanaged C++, which suited us perfectly, but it also using old coding techniques, malloc/alloc etc, it was not object oriented, and may be too old fashioned for most people. The fact that the code was on a floppy disk was also a practical problem, but the appendix feature the code as well. Naturally it does not feature the latest and greatest in neural networks but for us and perhaps for many other basic neural network users that matters less.

Neural Networks is a fairly complex and large field and there are academic books on Neural Networks that are thousands of pages long and filled with incomprehensible mathematics. This is not that kind of book. There are also books that attempt to explain Neural Networks to the layman and therefore do not contain any complex math, code, or details or practical examples. This is not that kind of book either. The book focuses a lot on three (or four layer) feed forward neural networks using back propagation training based on the least mean square error. I think that is appropriate since that is a very common neural network used for classification tasks using training (our case). However, the book discusses several other types of neural networks as well. There are 100’s of tidbits of advice on how to avoid local minima, and select, design, train and use neural networks.

If you need create the code for a neural network in unmanaged (old) C++ (and not use a tool kit) this old book might still be useful to you as it was to us.",4
Robin T. Wernick,4.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++,A Forgotten Gem for Computer Program Design,"There is a wave of present computing subjects that passes and leaves promising work buried in its wake when it is too advanced for current thinking and technology to make it catch on. The stealth fighter concept was buried in the Russian radar modeling theory of the 70's. Locheed engineers spotted it and produced the SR-71, B2, and the F-22 using this information. Modeling of extended gun barrel range enhancements(HAARP) allowed a researcher to develop a very large gun that would inject payloads into low earth orbit in the 1980's. Blumburg Capitol has been working on stock market predictors and has built several supercomputer clusters to give them the edge in rapid technical analysis of the market using GPUs. This book is one of those passed over knowledge treasures that has been forgotten by our demands for the latest and greatest entertainment. There is subtle treasure here for researchers.

If you want to know the kind of computing engines that they are using to find solutions, perhaps even yours, then read
""Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++"". The book introduces several different approaches to neural computing( think parallel here ) that can inspire you to find a solution within the book to your computing needs. The price to look is just the cost of shipping. If you want to save some typing then buy the complete version( with floppy ) for about $130. If your time is worth anything, you will buy them both and reap the benefits of years of research.

Now for the downside. This book was written in the early days of C++ and the author's skills lie in his research, not his programming skills. The C++ is written as though it is in C, the classes are elementary at best and OOD is not in these works. There is no working website source for eratta and followup development. The material in this book requires a kind of programming archaeology to reconstruct the thinking of the researcher. Nevertheless, you are given a glimpse of how to train your program to spot emerging trends and get your target predictors to work much better than they have before. Here is another hint, since these learning models are similar to the design of the( insert your species here ) brain, you may recognize your own decision patterns in these models. So, you can design a better working brain for yourself using these models. This kind of computing is for the advanced programmer and altering the models to meet your requirements is going to take weeks to months.

Einstein said, ""Inspiration is better than intelligence"". Here is where you can find that inspiration. So, if you want to spot that emerging business deal, the 'stock of the month', vacation deals, or the best approach to that girl you wanted to impress, take a look at these contents. This book contains the way to build decision makers that can bypass emotional bias, cultural blindness, and faddish nonsense. It's going to take some work.

Jeffrey Heaton,4.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Neural Network Recipies in C++,Complete C++ Source Code for Many Common Neural Network Algo,"This book is exactly what is described by its title.

The books is readable(at least as far as AI books go), it does not read like a mathematics text book, as many other AI books do.
The chapters are logically broken into the major neural network tasks: classification (identifying something), autoassociation (identifying a pattern by returning the same pattern), Time-Series Prediction (this is commonly applied to predicting the stock market, etc), Function Approximation.
As the author introduces these topics, various network architectures are discussed, such as feed-forward, multi-layer, backpropagation, and probalistic networks. Network optimization methods such as eluding local minima are tackled through the use of genetic algorism and simulated annealing.",5
Loves to Knit,3.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,A book for the dedicated math fan,"""The Imitation Game"" was my favorite movie of 2014. I devoured the shows on PBS about cracking Enigma. I was glad to start reading this book. Soon I wasn't so glad. The writer, a mathematician, doesn't have the gift for narrative needed to bring Turing, and the group at Bletchley Park, to life.
The trivia included rather than pruned shows a lack of writing skill. For example, in early chapters about Turing's schooling, one reads nearly every note sent home by a schoolmaster. But a more major event (nailing Turing under floorboards) was glossed over in a sentence without a comment by the author as to impact, or primary source quote concerning the incident.
More troubling is the utter boring chapter on Bletchley Park. How can this chapter be boring? Yet it is. The explanation and sketches of how Turing's machine worked are unsatisfactory. I didn't learn anything from the authors (and I had several advanced math classes in college). I contrast this with biographies of physicists, contemporaries of Turing but written by writers (Richard Rhodes, for example): gripping books that manage to explain quantum theory or the workings of particle accelerators quite well.
Absolutely unsettling is the jarring way the author skips from topic to topic. On one page he note that Turing accepted his sexual orientation; on the next there is talk of suicide. Again, there is no comment by the author. Considering how Turing's life ended, one would expect more explication here. Related to this topic is the story of Turing and Bob Augenfeld, the young refugee Turing sponsored. Turing propositioning the minor Augenfeld would today be classed as sexual predation, yet the author glossed over it, noting that Augenfeld remained friends with Turing. An alternative explanation might be that Augenfeld hoped Turing would help get his mother out of Vienna, and did not seek to sever the relationship for this reason. This was in 1941.
In summary, this book was slow reading, even for someone interested in the man and the topic. I give it 3 stars because of the importance of the topic and the many contribution Turing made to mathematics and computer sciences.",17
Inquiring Reader,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Too many digressions and diversions at the beginning!,"I am upgrading my review from *** to **** as I plow through the book. The book is quite good, but quite detailed or technical. Not for a general reader.

It is quite good to see the role that Turing played during WW II and how effective he was. He was also very ineffective at times because he was clueless about social clues and unwilling/unable to understand military/war hierarchies. Still a fascinating and detailed, detailed, and more detailed book.

My original review:

Digression after digression, especially at the beginning of the book. Do I really need to know what letters Turing sent to a friend's mother or how she replied? Quite distracting. Too many digressions about historical figures, too. There is too much of that in the first 15% or so of the book.

Once the book gets into Turing's post-graduate work and his work to create computers, that kind detail is very useful -- and relevant.

I ordered this book as a Kindle book, because there were too many complaints about the small font in the print copies. It's easy to read on a Kindle app.",16
Evelyn Uyemura,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,"Still an Enigma, but thought-provoking","This is a re-release of a book that was first published in 1983 (and largely researched during the 10 years prior to that), so it first came out in a very different time than today--a time when World WarII secrets were still being somewhat protected, and when the details of a homosexual man's life were still not easy to explain to the average audience without giving offense. Also, it was written and published in Great Britain. As a result, there are many allusions and off-hand references that are opaque to an American living in 2015.

Although the author is a gay rights activist himself, as well as a mathematician, and wrote this book in part to try to see Alan Turing's life from a sympathetic point of view, some of his narration comes across as coy to the point of obscurity--he mentions Turing's trip to Sweden, but it is not till much later that it finally becomes clear that he went there to pick up young men. It is never completely clear which of his friends were also lovers and which were just colleagues. And perhaps that was necessary when those men were still alive, or were only recently deceased, but if the book is going to be re-issued, it needed to be re-edited as well. The intro, which details places where changes should or could be made, was not an adequate substitute for a revised edition.

The explanations of code breaking is detailed, but perhaps necessarily obscure as well. I still have no idea of how Turing's insights were different than what the Polish codebreakers had already accomplished. One point that was a big issue in the movie, about how the Allies should use the information that they from their ability to read the Enigma code was never mentioned in the book, yet it is a crucial question--the movie has the military allowing a ship carrying one of the codebreakers's brothers go to its death, because otherwise the Germans would know that the Brits were able to read their messages, and would then change it. This is not in the book (fine, maybe it was fiction), but it's a key aspect of game theory--how do you use your hard-won information without tipping your hand? And if you can't use it, what's the point of having it?

It is a bit ironic that a book whose title implies that Alan Turing himself is the biggest enigma manages to leave him still an enigma in many ways, but that is the case.

I think the aspect of the book that I most grasped and that was the most thought-provoking was Turing's ideas about machine intelligence. Turing was not actually most interested in making machines that were intelligent; he was most interested in exploring intelligence in machine form in order to understand what human intelligence actually is. He posited an extreme statement: machines can (and will some day) do everything that human brains do. But his point was to show that there was no ""ghost in the machine,"" no special non-material ""spirit"" or ""will"" or ""intuition"" or ""insight"" necessary to explain human intelligence.

Like most people, I resist this idea to some extent. Could machines (computers, that is) ever make judgments? At first, my answer is no. But then they made computers that play chess at a Grand Master level (in the 1980s!). Ok, but that seems like a sort of a stunt. Recently IBM's Watson beat Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter at Jeopardy. Still, it seems more like looking things up on Wikipedia really fast, rather than actually thinking. But then I read that Watson is actually being used to diagnose illnesses, and that computers are more accurate than physicians, less liable to be led astray by forgetting or overlooking or dismissing crucial details. Hmmm, In advance, I would have said that the ability to diagnose a disease was an example par excellence of the sort of human judgment that computers would never have. And if they can drive our cars, and avoid accidents better than human drivers? Who would have thought it? Apparently the answer is, Alan Turing would have!

One off-hand remark in the afterword is that the author wonders if some day, a computer will be able to write a book such as his. Unimaginable, I think. But my daughter reminds me that computers already compose news items (rather badly, but still.) And we discuss the possibility that a basic undergraduate research paper could be composed by a computer today, and I think the answer is Yes. I can imagine that one could teach a computer to write a paper that discusses Domestic Violence, pulling together statistics on its frequency, demographics,causes, effects on children, possible solutions, and so forth.

I am left still puzzled by Alan Turing, finding it hard to picture him as a man, but deeply impressed by his mind, by his foresight and his insight, and I think that perhaps in some ways, he is in fact as significant a figure as Darwin and Einstein. What a tragedy that he died so prematurely, whether his death was in fact suicide, or possibly murder, or even more unlikely, a weird accident. How fitting and how odd that he died by (apparently) eating a poisoned apple. If it were fiction, it would just be too neat.",14
Quella,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,An enjoyable historic read...,"Where does Alan Turing: The Enigma rank among all the audiobooks you’ve listened to so far?
A bit more difficult to listen to than a fiction book because of the material it discusses, however it was a good book and audiobook combination. Highly recommend it for people who are interested in historic events and computers or encryption.

Who was your favorite character and why?
The story is about Alan, so I would have to say he is the one I like the most in this book.

Which scene was my favorite?
Not any one scene, but being able to see his passion and drive to get to a solution, often it was a detriment to him in the end (lost sleep, non compliant with work role, etc.) or others around him.

Was there a moment in the book that particularly moved me?
Not one specific point of movement for me. Maybe the ending of the book and seeing how his life ended and that he did not receive the credit due his name until recent history.",2
peterg,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Hodges provides a very good discussion of this question and Turing's resolution,"The book begins with the obligatory summary of his parents' lives and Turing's rather uneventful early years. It gets interesting when Turing gets to Cambridge, where he faces real intellectual challenges and starts on what was to be his major scientific accomplishment: the question known as “computability”. Hodges provides a very good discussion of this question and Turing's resolution, and how it lead to the concept of the Turing machine, a model that can be said to be implemented in all modern computers, but in no way serves as an ancestor of any of them.

The real fascination of Turing's career (for most of the reading public) is his work on calculating machines to aid in the decrypting messages from the German Enigma machine used to encode their naval communications, most particularly with their submarines. The particular contribution of Turing was the design of the electro- mechanical device called the “bombe” (an anglicization of the polish “bomba”, for a prior device for a similar purpose developed in Poland based on even earlier work in France in the late 1930's, at a time when both these countries seemed more sensitive to the need for decoding German military communications than was England). Turing's bombe was an electro-mechanical device that efficiently replicated the action of several Enigma machines wired together. As used by the Germans, the rotors of the Enigma (which provided the random encryption) were reset each day. The challenge for the British was to twiddle the rotors in the array of bombe's until they got some rational looking text from an attempted decryption of the intercepted German messages. Most of the enormous number of possible rotor settings were generally reduced by screening out those that did not produce any of a frequently used set of terms (called “cribs”) anywhere in the message. Once a promising setting was determined, all the rest of the messages for that day could be decoded. The book provides extensive details of bombe operations and how they were applied.

The book describes the roles of many individuals as the bombes were improved and their numbers expanded to operate at several sites in England (as a precaution against arial bombardment of a single site). While the book gives Turing the most important role in this process, it is nowhere near the “but for” importance implied in the movie “The Imitation Game”, which is loosely based on this book. The book describes several of Turing's unique contributions including his famous letter to Churchill, dated October 21, 1941, as an eminent scientist pleading for more funds to accelerate the Bletchley Park effort, Churchill's positive response may have made a significant difference in anti-submarine warfare at that time. Another unique contribution was Turing's visit to the United States from November 1942- March 1943, with his offering very perceptive guidance on the US bombe construction program (which eventually surpassed the British in numbers and speed of computation).

Nearly half of the last 100 pages of the book is devoted to Turing's affair with Arnold Murray and his subsequent prosecution for it. The author reveals that he (Hodges) is also a homosexual, as if to prepare the reader for some insight on the matter. I would have appreciated some explanation of the fact that, although Turing had a number of sexual relations with men of his own age, class and intellectual attainments (described fleetingly in the prior narrative), he suddenly chose a working class man, less than half his age, with only modest intellectual yearnings and no accomplishments. [My own interpretation is that he wanted, consciously or subconsciously, to be a martyr and brought the whole thing on himself by going to the police to report a minor burglary connected to the affair.] As for the larger social significance of the situation, Hodges tries to build a case that Turing was especially prosecuted because it was perceived that his uncontrollability made him a serious security threat. This argument is not very convincing since Turing had done no security work for at least 5 years previous and had no prospect of doing any in the future. Furthermore, there is no evidence of any involvement by high government officials, only a few local police and prosecutors.

I would advise skipping the rather lengthy introduction (31 pages) until after you've read the book; it doesn't introduce the subject, but does give some interesting tidbits of discoveries and re-interpretations since Turing's death. This subject is also treated in the Author's note at the end of the book.",3
bravhat1234,3.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,A Frustrating read,"Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges covers a fascinating and important subject in the life of Alan Turing, but I would not recommend it to a math layman like myself. Much of the book outlines the history of mathematical and scientific ideas of the first half of the 20th century, Alan's included of course, as well as describing the machines that he helped design and build. This makes for extremely rough reading, especially since the book is over 500 pages. I commend Hodges for the large amount of research that went into this book especially since Alan was so secretive.",22
Reid P.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,"Comprehensive and at times excellent, but could have used tighter editing.","There is much to like about this book: it provided a comprehensive explanation of the genesis of the idea of the Turing Machine (spoiler: it was more of a thought experiment to address a problem in mathematical theory than it was meant to lay the foundation of computer science) and it explained a good deal about Turing's involvement in breaking the Enigma code and his work on the first true electronic computers. Moreover, it explained (in a way contemporary readers may have forgotten) just how difficult and unjust life must have been for a gay man in Turing's era. For its scope, I give it four stars, though I am tempted to give it less: Hodges, for all his excellent qualities, sorely needed an editor's firm hand. Much of his mathematical and logical descriptions lacked clarity and bogged down the story - I wonder how many general readers were really able to follow them; the chapter lengths were, at times, interminable; the author presumed certain inside knowledge by the reader that he should not have (e.g., the significance of the book, ""The Cloven Pine""); and it would be fair to say that he let himself get too close to the subject. The last chapter, on Turing's tragic suicide, rambled far too much, including digressions into the power of the state, and it made an oblique attempt to blame American security sensibilities for Turing's death. It sounded a false note, and distracted from the important story that he had to tell. Nevertheless, on balance, Hodges has done a tremendous service here in bringing to light much about a man whose mind has had such an impact on this modern world in which we live.",3
Abby,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Difficult but rewarding read,"I read this book after watching the film the Imitation Game. I wanted more insight into this incredible man’s life. But this is a difficult read. Those unfamiliar with mathematics and related fields or who have little background with British culture will not pick up on all the nuances of Hodges’ efforts. However, this biography provides a thorough presentation of Turing’s life -- as far as existing records allow. It also unveils the many liberties that the film took and revealed a much more complicated man that could be portrayed in the film. Still, this book can’t completely interpret Turing, as the records are incomplete at best. If Turing was a genius, how could we ever hope to understand and appreciate everything he did? I recommend this book to two types of people: those with the expertise to understand Hodges' technical descriptions and those willing to slog through the technical details to gain an (albeit incomplete) understanding of an extraordinary life.",2
Catherine A Young,3.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,"Not an easy read, and a long book","This book is a difficult read. I have a science background, and technology does not slow me down, but I found the writing at some times inscrutable. Not an easy read, and a long book.",16
John I,2.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,A tough read,"I stuck with this book to the end, because I was genuinely interested in Alan Turing's contributions to cracking the Enigma code and to development of the electronic general purpose digital computer. However, this is NOT an easy book to read. The author, like Turing, is a mathematician, as well as homosexual, and dwells far too long and deeply on both subjects. Ironically, while reading the book I also saw children playing games on hand-held tablets and smart-phones with computing power that Turing could only dream about. Turing's work on encryption technology was unknown outside the group working at Bletchley Park during WW II, and only decades later, after his death, was it declassified. His work there literally changed the course of the war. But beyond that, the man clearly foresaw the essential architecture of modern computers, and managed to oversee its crude implementation. It seems the Brits really dropped the ball on developing a computer industry. I was also curious about Turing's interaction with John von Neumann, the Hungarian-born mathematician who has been more widely acknowledged as the ""father"" of modern digital computers. I learned many interesting things from the book, but a good editor would have cut out at least half of the fluff. Maybe this is one instance of the movie being better than the book. But I haven't seen the movie yet.",2
ProfBB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,The real truth behind the movie.,"I watched the movie and then wanted to find out the details. This (rather thick book) had it all, especially the insights into who Alan Turing was from childhood until his premature death. Most importantly, the author spoke with many of Turing's friends and colleagues to get to understand the man underneath the myth. As a professor of Computer Science the insights from the book gave enlightenment to my understanding of the history of my profession. Note: if the reader is not familiar with the foundations of computing there may be periods of confusion while reading. Wikipedia can be a big help here.",3
Bowie Bub,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Alan Turing: a complete picture,"Alan Turing was an unusual man at a time in history when unusual skills were needed. Much of Turing's work of breaking the German's Enigma code has been known for many years. Hodges presents a picture of Turing from a young boy through the years to adulthood which helps us understand this complex man more completely. Turing's Mother's book about him is from her viewpoint - perhaps slightly skewed. Hodges gives us a more complete picture. The book is well written without the need to know a great deal about the mathematics that consumed Turing at various stages of his development. Some well known stories of about Turning's driving habits were omitted in the book - they really did not add much to our understanding of Turning. Hodges does, at times, get very ""long winded"", however, the book is about as complete as any book can be about a man as complex and historically important as Alan Turing",2
Patricia J. Miller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Very scientific and detailed analysis of the progam leading up to solving Enigma,"Mr. Hodges writes well and is very thorough. Unfortunately, for me, I do not have the technical background to grasp what he is writing about. He goes into great detail about math and the physics involved leading up to Alan Turing's amazing work. I wish it were more readable. I was hoping for a book that would talk more about who he was as a human being, though he does touch on it occasionally. I had to give up reading it, as there were so many pages that were just too complicated and convoluted for me to understand. People with sufficient scientific background, I'm sure would thoroughly enjoy his book.",3
David S. Horn,3.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Way too technical and I loved math in college,"Sorry, but I have to agree with those who said the movie was ""better.""

Yes, it told his story, but it also went into all the details of what was going on with all the other players in the computer field in the UK in those years. Too much for me.
But, I will say that the pages that described how the actual Enigma machine worked were excellent.",4
Deebers,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Excellent Read,"An excellent read which trancends through history conisting of personalities and individually held beliefs. I firmly believe that Alan Turing's mathematical abilities is one of the primary reasons we are freely rending our thoughts on politics today, instead of being a nationality captive to Axis diectives. The U Boats were winning and the Allies were close to being brought to heel. Alan's breaking of the Enigma machine is absolutely one of the greatest accomplishments of the war years. The repayment was a government's disdain and conviction of his homosexuality which he eventally could not bear and thus took his own life.",1
Ralph Summers,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,"Allen Turing, Himself an Enigma","Andrew Hodges, a mathematician himself, was able to convincingly define the genius of Allan Turing. Here was a man probably 25 to 50 years ahead of his time not only with his Computable Numbers research but also with the early concepts of what has become the modern day programmable computer. In addition he had valuable concepts for the current, still in its relative infancy, artificial intelligence technology. Allen Turing was a remarkable person. In addition to being a pure mathematician with impeccable research credentials, he, unlike most pure mathematicians, had interests in engineering and electronics and became somewhat proficient in those fields as well. His personal life was complicated, rather sad, and ended tragically at a young age. Highly recommended reading.",2
Windguy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,I highly recommend it even if the historical accuracy is skewed somewhat,"I was compelled to read this book after seeing the movie The Imitation Game. It moved me greatly. I highly recommend it even if the historical accuracy is skewed somewhat. I am a software engineer and the name Alan Turing was a familiar name to me many years ago. I was eager to learn more about his life and contributions to computer science. This book makes a serious attempt to reveal the depth of Alan Turing, but at times it seemed the author was embellishing with details about Alan's personal life that would not be publicly available. Even as an engineer I found the mathematical descriptions rather tedious. I was most engaged with the sections on his contributions to computer architecture and his relationship with John von Neumann; another visionary engineer who contributed greatly to the development of computers as we know them. Alan was clearly a visionary who was at least 60 years ahead of his time. His notions about thinking machines surpass even what AI is capable of today. One can only wonder how far this field of AI would have advanced had he lived a full life. Getting through this lengthy book was a bit of a slog at times but I'm glad I read it.",1
A. Sturgess,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,I do recommend this book,"For those who are interested in delving deeper into the the character of Alan Turing than what ""The Imagination Game"" might provide, I do recommend this book. Because of the secret nature of his work during the war and otherwise spotty records, Alan was not the easiest subject to research, even so, I feel that I know the nature of the man. He was a genius and like some of them he may have been somewhat of a mathematical idiot savant, lost in a world that most of us will never understand. Given insights that we cannot begin to comprehend and capable of fluently speaking a binary language, he was sometimes clumsy in social interaction outside of the world of academia.
I wish there had been more detailed record of his life as his death, to me, seemed somehow out of character and unexpected. The verdict of suicide was not universally accepted, especially by his mother.
A good historical read with many interesting insights by Hodges into the mathematical issues that were the subject of Alan's research. I was struck by how many of Turing's ideas about computers anticipated the current world in which we live.",1
inspectorudy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Not for the WWII drama and the Enigma crowd,It's hard to see how this book was used as the screenplay for the new movie. It is interesting for the first 30% of the book and then goes off ona a very technical turn that is frankly boring as hell. Gradually it gets into the latter part of Turing's life and his homosexual issue as well as his computer dreams. It is not very interesting to the person who was intrigued by the braking of the Enigma machine. Turing is almost a savant by today's standards so a lot of his social endeavors are awkward and mawkish to a normal person. They do help understand him but it is more of a psychoanalysis than good reading. There are much better books about the breaking of the Enigma than this one if that's what you are reading about. If it is about Turing then this is a decent book although the author gets real technical.,2
Liz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,"Long, dense, difficult but rewarding","This is a long book that goes into great detail on both of the major aspects of Turing life--his scientific contributions and his homosexuality (viewed as criminal at the time.) I loved this book because it gave such a clear, clean description of his scientific contributions along with the context in which he made his observations. This is arguably the best book one can buy that describes his very major contributions to science to the non-mathematician. I did find myself skimming many of the pages dealing with his personal relationships though--the rules of the time were obviously brutal and Turing obviously suffered greatly, but my own interest was mostly in understanding other aspects of his life. My guess is that most readers will end up skimming much of the book (which parts skimmed will depend on reader interest). This book is not one for the casual reader who wants to learn everything in an hour. It is a long book but one well worth reading.",1
RGW,2.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,"Turing a genius, the book tedious","I was drawn to buying the book from watching the film. Turing was a genius, in the eccentric British way of the early 1900's.

I was hoping to get a good overview on Turing and his development of the Enigma breaking machine, but in the end I could not see the wood for the trees. Andrew Hodges, went in to so much background detail, often on loosely related peripheral matters, that I found my self skipping 3-4 pages at a time, without loosing the thread.

However, the last more personal aspect of the book, addressing Turing's humanism and personal interactions was enjoyable, sometimes even very much so.

He is an unknown hero we are only now coming to terms with due to his secret work during WW2 and his homosexuality. I read the book after seeing the film, and it becomes very obvious that the film in no way does this man justice. The film shows him in a good light but only paints the barest pencil sketch of his life and achievements. The book is very thorough as Turing deserves leaving no stone unturned and this is partly because the author is him self an accomplished mathematician and a homosexual though the subject is do well treated this comes out as understanding and depth not as prejudice or bias.

G. Tomer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,We can learn and prevail,"Alan Turing: The Enigma The Centenary Edition Andrew Hodges is a scientist who wrote a triumph of love and genius: about a young man who's unique insight and unmeasured abilities found solutions that lead us to computers in 1936. But, there's more - Turing's solution found immediate approval from the great Kurt Godel. These talented young men tore mathematics from the breast of philosophy and threw it onto the floor of humanity's aspirations and dreams. The center of mathematics transferred from Germany to Princeton's Institute of Advanced Study; and when the pre-eminent Albert Einstein left Europe for the IAS, physics became an American prize.

As the Nazi political party became the German government, Turing was studying for his Ph.D. at Princeton with Alonzo Church and his two close associates, S.C. Kleene and J. Barkley Rosser. However, Turing realized the threat to England would culminate in war. Despite an offer to work with his childhood idol J. von Neumann, Turing returned to England in time to join ""Foreign Service"" at Bletchley Park. Hodges pace is a marathon: Turing was a marathon runner who nearly competed for his country in the 1949 Olympics. Writers who have continued the mythology of Turing's various ills and shortcomings must read the research efforts of Mr. Hodges. He presents Turing as he was known and witnessed by his friends, associates, detractors, and his competitors.

Anyone interested in knowing or understanding computer science, mathematics, and the actual history of the genius who created the foundations of the internet and modern computer theory should spend some time reading Hodges and his ponderous study of Alan Mathison Turing. The Enigma is written for serious believers in humanity and miracles - and the failure of the world to recognize real heroes. Without knowing Alan Turing, we cannot appreciate today's freedoms. Turing and Bletchley Park were evenly portrayed: as a collective, BP was the hope of a free world. BP was comprised by true-believers from England and the Commonwealth, the Middle East, Poland, and America. Over 80% were women and they played vital roles. A high percentage in BP relative to a low percentage in England's total population were Jewish. Read the book and learn from the best! When you analyze the actual devices of Engima and Lorenz created by German armed forces and scientists, it seems improbable that anyone could break the code.

Nearly all of the WWII codebreakers are gone. Yet, their dedication to prevail ultimately allowed the Allied forces to have a D-day, and previously helped the English and American forces in North Africa to defeat the great Rommel. Without the codebreakers, the war would have lasted another two years (by some estimates) and the death toll even higher. Turing's story is not unique, not as an Englishman, nor as a human. Every codebreaker in their huts had stories... What makes Turing different was his ability to continue toward solutions when others failed. Unfortunate for the world: England refused to honor him; and violated his rights when their government prosecuted him as a criminal. Turing's refusal to demean his humanity, or to yield under the forces of conformity, was magnificant - far greater than his genius. We have heard the apology: when his name is cleared of supposed wrongdoing, remains our burden. Only Andrew Hodges could possibly bring these thoughts any reality. Perhaps we can learn more about each other by listening to Hodges.",26

Amanda S. Mills,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,and very fine detail of the time and society in which Alan ...,"I got through “The Enigma” only recently. When I say I “got through” I mean it. Being 540 pages of very small print, it was conquered over weeks.

It was worth it.

Turing was a fascinating person with a very rich story which Hodge’s provides in the form of anecdotes from family and colleagues, letters written by Turing, and very fine detail of the time and society in which Alan lived.

Alan’s childhood, in particular tugged at my heart strings, being familiar enough to my own experiences, and traits I see in my eldest son, I felt it easy to put myself in his shoes.

(Alan Turing was not, that we will ever know, autistic. It is important to NOT jump to that conclusion. Yet he was, most certainly, different.)

I found it parts amusing, and parts heart wrenching. I also found myself angry that we didn’t learn about this man in school.

My only criticism of the book is that often times the book departs away from Alan’s story into long tangents about the development of math theories, and highly technical descriptions concerning cryptology (cryptography and cryptoanalysis as well). As a person born the 1970’s, I appreciated the historical explanation of the significance of cryptology to the war, and the attention to the intricacy of Mr. Turing’s projects. YET, I often felt lost, uninterested or confused while reading the long discussions of different theories. I think much of the book was written for people with backgrounds in maths and cryptology, not the average reader.

I hear that the movie ""The Imitation Game"" (screenplay based on this book) has been criticized for not enough explanation or being simplistic. I understand the desire to not bore or hopelessly confuse the audience. The important part is Mr. Turing as a person, which I hope they get right. If early reviews mean anything, it seems they have.

I will hold on to this book, and recommend others read it, skipping past the overly technical parts if need be. You may also need a magnifying glass.",16
C H Miller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Turing gave an illuminating proof of uncomputability; this book does the same for a life,"This outstanding biography of a unique, outstanding and challenging human being is full of integrity and insight. The author is himself a mathematician / logician, and is able to communicate Turing's work and scientific principles in an accessible yet rigorous way. Plus, the author's broad knowledge of the modern social history of homosexuality brings a good mix of depth, objectivity and empathy to his view of Turing and the essential dilemmas of Turing's life. To label one's subject an ""enigma"" might seem at first a cop-out. But here it is a forthright statement of the stubborn and mysterious existential inner conflict and puzzle of the man's life, which his genius could not solve. Turing prized truth above all, but had the same subjective longings as all of us, that defeat logic at every turn. One of Turing's achievements was to prove the uncomputability of certain values; this book does the same for a life.",10

Turing, the man who paved the way for developing our modern-day computers is lost, and almost forgotten, in the technical minutae on which Hodges spends page after mind-dulling page.

The sections on Logic were interesting to me, but only because one of my undergraduate minors is in Logic, but I'm not sure how enlightening they would be for those not familiar with it.

Turing is, more than anyone else, the father of the modern computer, a man who could visualize something which did not even exist.

For all of us who grew up in families who's members were the actors of the Great World War and responsible for coping with the changes in our culture that resulted in the aftermath of that great struggle, the story of Alan Turing is a critical aspect of making sense of the world we live in going into the 21st century. The ongoing collective fear of our culture is surely the result of not really understanding how it was that we and our allies survived and then won the war agains our enamies and then went on to create the greatest growth of industry and well being of all recorded time. Alan Turing's secret contribution to the war effort and the resulting foundation for all that has followed based on his vision of a ""universal computing machine"" goes a long way to explaining our current world. It may dispell some of the anxiety that has persisted in our culture because we did not understand how our world has come to be as it is in this age of information and virtual reality.",1

Metallurgist,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Interesting and informative,"The book is well written and highly informative. It covers all of Turing's life and all aspects of his death. Furthermore, the author, who is a mathematician, also provides detailed information about Turing's mathematical accomplishments. This is done in a general way and I felt that it was generally quite accessible, but the book contains a lot of material on this, and this might be a negative for some readers.

What is in the book -
- The book describes Turing early life and schooling. It discusses the fact that he and his older brother were left as boarders while his parents returned to India shortly after his birth. The book covers his schooling prior to and at Cambridge University.

- The book discusses in detail his work on the logic basis for the computer. Much of this is quite mathematical.

- The book covers, in quite a bit of detail his involvement with the work ""breaking"" the German Enigma cipher machine. There is a lot of detail about this, but not as much as in many other books, for instance Budainsky's ""Battle of Wits"".

- The book goes into detail about his contributions to the building of British computers after the war.

- The book goes into considerable detail about his guilty plea against the charge of ""gross indecency"", the forced medical treatments to ""control"" his homosexuality, and how this may have resulted in his suicide. The book clarifies a lot about this and even makes a case that his death might have been accidental instead of suicide.

- The last part of the book discusses the subject of the impact of homosexuality on security clearance in general.

While I liked the book I could not give it five stars for two reasons. Firstly could have been reduced by at least 100 pages without any loss of information regarding Turing's life. Secondly, this centenary edition is printed with small type. While the typeface and printing produced sharply printed letters (at least for my book), the size of the letters took quite a bit of getting used to. I could not have read it prior to my cataract operations. All in all, I recommend the book, although some readers may want to skim over portions of it.",6

Jill Meyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,"Did he have to ""bite the apple""?","British author Andrew Hodges' biography, ""Alan Turing: The Enigma: The Book That Inspired the Film ""The Imitation Game"" (now that's a mouthful!) is going to appeal to a self-selected readership: history readers and math readers. I doubt anyone else is going to pick up this book and read it for the fun of it. So, I am pitching my review to those historians and mathematicians who will read this book.

Andrew Hodges does an excellent job in telling the story of Alan Turing and his ""times"". Beginning with his early life in England as one of two sons of an India Service official and his wife, his years in ""public school"", and his time at Kings College, Cambridge, Hodges is a very literate biographer. I can judge this part because I know a fair bit of history. What I cannot say with any certainty is if Hodges gets the math part correctly. I am a math-moron and I could sort of follow his writing. If the reader is good in math, he should have no problem in understanding what Alan Turing accomplished in both the World War 2 and after. As the master code breaker at Bletchley Park, Turing broke German cypher codes from their Enigma machine and was instrumental in helping save the North Atlantic allied shipping from German Uboats. He was also considered one of the fathers of computer science, working after the war until his suicide in 1954.

The ""death by poisoned apple"" in my review's title refers to the method of suicide Turing used. Alan Turing was a homosexual in a time when homosexuality was illegal. He pled guilty of ""gross indecency"" in a British court in 1952 and rather than serve time in jail, he chose to take ""hormonal"" treatment to reduce his libido. He found the treatments a life-altering and they, along with losing his government security clearance, may have contributed to his decision to commit suicide.

Alan Turing was treated very shabbily in life and in death, many honors were denied him. He and his contributions to computer science and mathematics began to be recognised in 1966 when the ""Turing Award"" was first awarded by the Association for Computer Machinery. Other honors - both by governmental and collegiate officials - have followed, as well as plays, movies, and biographies of Alan Turing.

Andrew Hodges' biography was originally issued in the 1990's. It is now being reissued as an adjunct to the movie, ""The Imitation Game"", starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing and Kiera Knightly as fellow-code breaker, Joan Clarke. In the previews of the movie, Knightly is shown as the ""love interest"" of Cumberbatch. In reality, the two were engaged during their work at Bletchley but broke it off short of marriage. I'm curious to see how the movie handles Turing's homosexuality, but that's for another review. As for this biography, it is very, very well done.",17

JET,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Who killed the inventor of the computer?,"One enormous possibility is left hanging by this otherwise diligent account of the life of the man who envisaged the computer.
Was he killed by the State?
Turing's death was suicide, the State recorded. But it did so with a strange carelessness, neglecting to analyse the half-nibbled, supposedly cyanide-dipped apple found beside his body.
The author may have suspected the State disposed of Turing in an era of hysterical fear about homosexuals and blackmail and Cold War security breaches, but his hints are as faint as the certainty surrounding the end of a genius Britain could ill-afford to waste.
State-ordered executions by the post World War II forces of good are by no means outside the realms of possibility, if we accept the conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy boys and others.
Turing's recklessness (to official eyes) made him a prime target for unofficial execution. He harboured State secrets of the highest order, but also an inconvenient desire for individual freedom, especially to pursue sexual satisfaction in times when his predilections were considered deeply perverse by officialdom.
The author fails to explore this obvious thesis, however, and leaves us to wonder.
His book is a tedious read for its complexity. However, those patient enough to chip away at it are rewarded with a remarkable account of a man so far ahead of his time as to be incomprehensible to those who knew him and worked with him.
The fact I am able to write this review with the unseen aid of a lot of ones and zeroes working magically behind the screen of my iPad is attributable to the extraordinary mind of Alan Turing.
Where might we be if he had lived to see the outcome of his vision?",3
Tenchi in DC,2.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,The Book a Guilt-Ridden Nation wrote in tribute to Alan Turing.,"I found this book incredibly slow. Since Alan Turing didn't live a terribly long time, did a lot of theoretical work, and was introverted; making a full length book must have been challenging. The book moves slowly as the author attempted to spend inordinate amounts of time describing Alan's childhood and formative years; fully 25% of the book is about his pre-university years. The author also spends a lot of time explaining math theory which again makes the book slow. A reader looking for an understanding of Turing's work on the Enigma will be disappointed; I would estimate less than 10% of the book covers his work on this WWII problem. If you're looking for a fleshing out of Turing the person, this might be the book for you. The entire text reads like a memorial for Turing; a guilt-ridden wake extolling the virtues of the wrongly accused.",4

I am moving on, looking for another book about Alan Turing. Don't make the same error I did.",1
Robert Lawton,4.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Turing Explained - Turing Hijacked,"Alan Turing makes an absolutely fascinating subject for biography. Not only did Turing significantly contributed to the allied victory in World War II, but one may also consider him to be the father of the modern ""thinking machine."" Indeed, most introductory computer textbooks still contain references to the ""Turing test"" for artificial intelligence.
In Part 1, Hodges writes a riveting account of Turing's youth, scientific pursuits, and war-time contributions. He carefully details descriptions of the German ""Enigma"" coding machine, coding theory, and the code breaking process. Having no significant background in mathematics or ciphering, the reader could probably build his or her own Enigma machine based solely on Hodge's lucid descriptions.
Unfortunately, Part 2 does more to promote Hodges' own agenda than it does to illuminate Turing's life. Hodges makes his agenda clear for Turing's biography following the Postscript in a section labeled ""Author's Note from the 1983 Edition."" In this, Hodges explains that he discovered Turing for himself while preparing a pamphlet critical of the current medical model of homosexuality as member of London's Gay Liberation Front (535). Part 2 of this biography clearly serves as a platform for that purpose.
While generally dull, Part 2 did offer a few surprises. Though not stated explicitly, Hodges' illustrations demonstrate that the premise behind ""Clockwork Orange"" finds its roots in the state of England's psychiatric medicine in the 1950's. Imprisonment, castration, hormone therapy, operant conditioning, and psychiatric treatment all played a part in the West's attempts to understand and cope with the nature of homosexuality and the male homosexual's role in society.
Since Turing himself did not crusade for gay rights or take any interest in the rather well known intellectual gay communities of the time, the author's agenda appears significantly out of place. Though persecuted, prosecuted, convicted, and ""treated,"" Turing simply wished to be left alone to pursue his various interests. Hodges should have done the same. Yes, details of Turing's relationships, lifestyle, arrest, trial, and treatment belong in a biography along with their historical context, but Hodges frequently departs with obscure references and musings many readers might not understand and which were simply not part of Turing's own experience.
This biography also left me craving more details regarding the links between Turing's early work and his later work as well as for more details specifically about his later work. I don't think Turing simply changed fields of interest mid career. After all, buried within the mechanics of nature lie the seeds of non-artificial intelligence. What better way to recreate that intelligence artificially than by mastering and modeling the original?
I recommend special treatment for this biography. Rather than bullying your way through every page, simply start reading from the beginning, stop when you lose interest, and don't feel guilty about putting it down incomplete.",55

Mec,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Wild and lonely,"""A free society is one where it is safe to be unpopular."" -- Adlai Stevenson

Alan Turing died young. Few people shared his interests during his lifetime; and one of his major works was classified for the entire duration of his life. And Turing himself was not quite anti-social; more a-social, or stand-off-ish. He was interested in friendly relationships only with people who shared his interests, and these were few. Even his runner's club would have given him few outlets for friendship -- running was not very popular in the 1930's.

Hodge chronicles every documented moment of Turing's life. However, most of the narrative after his adolescence feels like we are watching Alan Turing, not being with Alan Turing.

If this were a work of fiction, I would chide the author to do better, to show more of the book from Alan's point of view. But this is a biography. Hodges got as close as any biographer can with the material available.

How many more Alan Turings are there right now?

On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth I acquired the new Centenary Edition of the biography and read it again. I still think of it as one of the very best, and in the intervening 29 years since it was first published I have read many other science biographies. The biography itself is unaltered, but Hodges has added a new Preface that adds some perspective to both Turing and the biography itself. I strongly recommend this new Centenary Edition. Turing was a remarkable man, who laid the intellectual foundations for computer science in general and artificial intelligence in particular. In the last few years before his tragic suicide he got interested in biology, and one has to believe that if he had lived longer, he might have emerged as a major figure in that field as well.",2

Kevin Lindsey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alan Turing: The Enigma,Wonderful Histories,"Two books for the price of one.
The first is an excellent biography of Alan Turing and his contributions to number theory, computer science, cryptography, and World War II. He was an amazing man, although it's hard to escape the conclusion that his post-war years were nothing but a footnote to Bletchley.
The second is a frank history of homosexuality in the U.K. in the years immediately before and after the war. It's amazing how far we've come.
If there's a criticism of this book, it's that the author never really seems to connect the two themes. The only thing they have in common is Alan Turing; his homosexuality had no apparent influence on his mathematics, and his mathematics had no obvious impact on his sexuality. The whole gay side of Turing's life probably could have been left out of this work with little appreciable impact.
That minor exception aside, this is a beautiful work. I particularly appreciate Hodges's treatment of Turing's suicide; he doesn't blame it on the estrogen treatments, on British intelligence, on GCHQ security, or on the Freemasons. Turing simply killed himself for no apparent reason. (Why Douglas Hofstadter, who wrote the introduction to the book, blamed Turing's death on ""a chemistry accident"" is a mystery.)
Hodges is an elegant writer who should have taken up literature instead of mathematics.",4

This is not a biography in a usual sense. It is a way for the writer to show off his knowledge of mathematics rather than focus on Alan Turing and his life.

Retired Reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Model Patterns: A Metadata Map (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems),Enterprise Architecture,"This is a very good book with a somewhat obscure title. Its subject is how to construct an information management system for a commercial enterprise. Its sub-title, ""A Metadata Map"" actually refers to the fact that the first step in building such a management system is to describe the business of the enterprise for which it is being constructed.
What Hay has done is update the absolutely first rate work of John Zachman who over twenty years ago developed the ""Enterprise Architectural Framework"" which is essentially a matrix that can guide the development of an information management system based on the organization structure and processes of the enterprise itself. The Zachman framework is the basis for the ""Data Model Patterns"" in the title of this book and indeed the book is organized around this framework. It provides step by step descriptions on the construction of an information management system for a notional enterprise.
It should be noted that Hay is well aware that information management is more than simply building a database (data warehouse). Information storage is pointless without some means of organizing and classifying it. In his experience as a consultant to Oracle he learned to model the structure of an enterprise not simply a data base. This is something that is possible using a relational database which can be used to describe the structure of an organization. The ""metadata"" used in this book refers to a description of the information used and to the description of the enterprise itself. As Hay notes there are many resources that can be used when constructing an information management system for a commercial enterprise. For example he advises going to the Business Rules Group to obtain both correct terminology and rules compliant with standard business practices.
This book is good as a practical guide and as an excellent exposition on the Zachman Framework.",2
R. Gantt,4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Model Patterns: A Metadata Map (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems),Great Stuff,"This book is great stuff for Enterprise Architects. The discussion of Zachman is better than any of the Zachman Institues articles. The explanation of the value of architectural meta-models is excellent.

On the down side, the meta-models presented are very good EXCEPT that the author still presents data as being a part of an application. Surely 20 or so years after James Martin we are past that. Applications with their own data schemata are to be avoided and suppressed, rather than endorsed.

If your are a ""real"" Enterprise Architect, then this is book indispensable, but review all of the meta-models carefully to insure that they comply with your particular religion.",10

T. Daley,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Hidden Pattern: A Patternist Philosophy of Mind,Most people should pass on this book.,"The many positive reviews for this book are surprising to me. This book is a very hard read in my opinion for the average reader. This book was also poorly edited in my mind. If you are artificial intelligence fan or have a good understanding of computer programing you might enjoy reading this book. I think most readers will find the book very technical, repetitive, and at times nonsensical. Ben Goertzel has a lot to say. Maybe too much. At times the book reads like a stream of consciousness where every though that comes to Ben's mind is laid out for us. Some of his statements are quite interesting while others are not fully developed and not supported by any scientific research. The book could have been only half as long and still covered all the important points that the author was trying to make. The one thing I did take from this book is how incredibly difficult it is to create artificial intelligence that is modeled after the the human brain.",2
Samuel Meredith,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Hidden Pattern: A Patternist Philosophy of Mind,Wonderful synthesis,"My formal educational and intellectual level is that of an orthopedic surgeon, a fairly low level of narrow, technical, applied science compared to the author's stratospheric achievement. As a pre-school child I rejected religion and put my faith in science as the ultimate explanation for reality. Beyond basic biology I have expanded my scientific reading into physics, evolution, emergent properties of complex systems, and neuroscience's pursuit of consciousness and behavior. I have enjoyed the history and theories of language and its poetic expression. Having rejected orthodox Western religion, I still could not escape a strong attraction to the numinous, and this led me into the psychology of religion and especially C.G. Jung, as well as the Eastern traditions for a ""theology"" without a Man in the Sky. Buddhism confirmed my childhood doubts as to the absolute reality of my conscious Self. Yet here it was, my mind and its conscious interface between it and the mysteries of external reality, along with those of my fellow humans; the only window of experience and agent of behavior. I have longed for an understanding of consciousness, thought and behavior, science-spiritual synthesis, and any possible Theory of All Things.

In a much updated, expansive book in the tradition of Edward O. Wilson's Consilience, adding recent advances in technology and AI, the author presents an intriguing theory of mind. Out of this ""humble"" and ""narrow"" effort comes something close to a Theory of All Things for me. He draws together so many of my areas of interest mentioned above. I am nearly through my first reading, an exercise in overview and highlighting key points and concepts and skipping or filtering out those deeply technical things beyond my desire or ability to consume. I look forward to my second reading of my simplified edited version. The author might have produced such a version For Dummies. He did not, although he makes it pretty easy to sort through and frequently suggests that the non-tech reader skip to the next chapter. Perhaps in my next life I will have the expanded intellect to grasp every idea and concept with ease.",3
Richard A. Avellar,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Hidden Pattern: A Patternist Philosophy of Mind,Wonderful,"I think this may be one the greatest books ever written, at least that I have read. Though, it is a philosophy book, I think it is highly speculative. The writer gives wonderful insights into reality (not so much the physical level of the world). This is the first book for me that lays down the frame work that up roots the objectivist ideal of the primary of the physical world. It may have just moved the primary to existence( higher/quantum=pattern space]) alone, in as much that observing/subjective reality plays a more important role in the make-up of the world. But this is not to say that consciousness as an entity is real or primary. As I understand Patternism, the subjective AND the objective together make patterns. And it is patterns that are primary, in the sense of pre-quantum world becoming real not in the minds of conscious beings, but in the dynamics of its own surroundings, thereby loosing its de-coherence in the measurements thereof. If the event can be measured from it's effects then it looses it pre-quantum state (wave state), thereby becoming real. It is the measurements of things that are the important aspect of entities. Once an object has properties/qualities it can no longer go back into the non-measured world/pre-quantum world. Qualities and measurements makes things real, not the stuff that it is made of. The qualities and measurements are the real parts. The parts that cannot be touched is what makes things stand out in our world. i.e. time, straightness, colors, etc. These things are the real things, not the things that are measured. (WONDERFUL!).... The measurement of things is what is real. Not the things that we normally think is real. From this I have come to a thought that electrons themselves have no substance in themselves, it is only the measurement of them or it's properties that is what we come to know as the electron. The world is made of measurement and relationship. Then again, I may have this all wrong.
Dr. (and I usually reserve this title for M.D.s) Goertzel goes further to show that language is a measurement. It is the bridge between the subconscious and conscious. My take on this is the subconscious equates to the quantum world and the physical world to the conscious. (again....WONDERFUL!)
As a philosophy Dr. Goertzel doesn't present Patternism as structured as the other philosophies i.e. Objectivism but he does cover most of the topics. i.e. metaphysics, ethics, not so much aesthetics (art) and epistemology(reason)

Like so many of the books that stand out to me as great intellectually, there is so much in this book that I wish I could only retain a fraction thereof and I would be happy.

VINICIUS G MENDONCA,4.0 out of 5 stars,OpenCV 2 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook,Very practical approach,"When I bought this book, I was looking for a very practical approach in the subject of computer vision. And that's what I found.

As a computer vision student, I had trouble understading the theory presented in other books, even those with ""practical"" in their titles. The subject is normally presented in a very theoretical way, with paper references and strong mathematical approach, and no working samples at all. In other books, each tracking step is discussed with so many details, and with so many alternative approachs, that was really difficult for me to understand when to use one approach or another.

The book does not provide up to date computer vision information, and does not provide explanations of several opencv2.0 algorithms. That's why I took one star out. It's an opencv2 introduction book and enforces the C++ style and the new Opencv2 API.

But, if you expect no more than that, it is a fairly good introduction to the subject of computer vision. Every algorithm is explained in a direct language, you can easily implement the proposed programs, change some algorithm parameters, and see the results for yourself. After reading it, it will be considerably simpler to read a more theoretical book, or to understand academic papers on the subject.",1

I didn't have any C++ experience before (only Matlab, Python, Java), but the book did a good job of introducing me to an object-oriented approach to image analysis. (Especially the frame processor class introduced in the last chapter saved me from losing my mind.)

I also found the explanation of how to set openCV up in the Qt IDE most useful.

The various algorithms are presented in a nice, intro-level way, but if you want to know more about the math behind it, you should pick up another book (references to technical papers are presented throughout the book, though.) I give it 4 points only because the theory comes a bit short. (For that, I'd read ""Learning OpenCV"" Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library)",1

From a actual library perspective ... this is a bunch of easy matrix routines, not network mesh based, so the library is more old school image processing(i.e. the title of saying computer vision ... is missleading ... since this has very little to do with modern vision algorithms). It's terribly out of date from a viewpoint on where the state of the art is for vision processing ... (like 20 years) ... maybe that's in part of the library not included in the book.

J. J.

He has performed stunt work in everything from ""Emergency"" & ""Wonder Women"" up to the iconic monster Jason from ""Friday the 13th"". His newest character - Victor Crowley - is soon to rival any big screen horror icon.

However, that's only half the story. Kane Hodder is absolutely nothing like the characters he plays. And I can attest to this - I've met the man. He absolutely LOVES his fans, talking almost twice the amount of time to talk with then at conventions than most celebrities. He helps mentally heal burn victims (being one himself) and even picked a fan up out of his wheelchair to carry him through a haunted house when Kane found out it wasn't wheelchair accessible.

Even if you know NOTHING of horror movies - or even who Kane Hodder is - you need to make this book a top priority on your reading list.

Bridget R,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unmasked: The True Story of the World's Most Prolific, Cinematic Killer","Not Only A Great Book,But A Great Guy Behind The Mask-Mr.Kane Hodder","I got both book's that Kane and Mike put out. The first one being The Killer & I and then UNMASKED Kane's autobiography. I love them both. I could not put them down. I couldn't even wait to get off from work everyday just so i could come home and actually read something i really loved and enjoyed. I don't really do a whole lot of reading,but this was just something i had to get and had to read and i am so glad that i did. I have really learned alot about Kane as well. He talk's about numerous thing's that have happened in his life. I myself can relate to alot of stuff that Kane as been through,cause i have been there and done that too. If there is anyone who hasn't read the book,you should really get a copy and sit down and read it. I am pretty sure you won't be disappointed with the book. I know Kane would really appreciate it if everyone would get a copy and read it. I honestly believe that Kane is a good person. I don't think he is like alot of the other celebritie's in the world,and i will explain why. Kane really love's his fan's and take it from me this is something i know to be the truth. Alot of celebritie's go on about how they love their fan's and all that but to be honest alot of them don't give a flying flip about their fan's. I have friend's that have supported celebritie's for year's and when it came time for that fan to get an autograph or just to meet that person,well guess what they got snobbed by that celebrity. When that happened that fan didn't want anything to do with that celebrity anymore and they would tell you that they got snobbed. I can honestly say that Kane is not like that. Kane really care's about and love's his fan's. Kane is a great guy and i support him and stand behind him 100%. For those of you whom may not like Kane for whatever reason,i will say this-everyone is entitled to their own opinion of whom they may or may not like. I for one love Kane and i think he is a great guy,actor and stuntman. I think you should get to know him personally a little more or even go meet him and see what he is like in person and you maybe suprised,before you start going and passing judgement on him. This is just my opinion. Like i said i love Kane,i think he is a great guy and both book's are great. Kane is only human just like everyone else in the world,he has feeling's just the same and yes he has and will make mistake's but don't we all. I don't think you will find a better book or a better guy than Kane Hodder! So Kane if you was to read this by some chance,you are a great guy no matter what. You have a fan right here that love's your book and you. Don't stop doing what make's you happy,alway's stay positive no matter what. You have and alway's will have my support Kane. Keep up the good work!!!!",1
Evan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unmasked: The True Story of the World's Most Prolific, Cinematic Killer",fantastic,"I have read twelve books on my Kindle. The first one (Death's Daughter) was the best of the bunch out of the first eleven. That changed when I read this one. I recommend you familiarize yourself with Kane Hodder's work before you read this book. Watch the Hatchet movies, Friday the 13th 7-10, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3, and Ed Gein: the Butcher of Plainfield. This is the best autobiography I've ever read including biographys not written by the subject. Kane Hodder's has some really interesting stories to tell and the one about his burn accident is absolutely heart-wrenching. This book is funny, informative, honest, interesting, and an overall good read. Kane Hodder has a passion for what he does, and reading this you feel like he's a good guy he could be cool to hang out with (and fans who have met him say he is). It's hard to say what's the best thing about the book, but this book is a must-read for his fans, and a must read for those new to his work. Highly recommended.",1
James J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unmasked: The True Story of the World's Most Prolific, Cinematic Killer",Not What I Was Expecting....It Was Better!!!,"I've been a Friday the 13th fan for the longest time, so I couldn't wait to hear the tales told by the man who played Jason four(count 'em four)times. You would think that because only about 25% of the book is about his time as the iconic Jason Voorhees, that I would have been extremely disappointed. Wrong! The stories about his youth, getting into the business as a stuntman, the stunt burn gone horribly wrong(I won't give away any more here, but it is a must read section) are just as exciting and interesting as his time being the horror movie legend we know him as today. I ""killed"" this book in 2 1/2 hours. This is a must have book for any horror fan!!!",3
Kat,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Unmasked: The True Story of the World's Most Prolific, Cinematic Killer",Couldn't put it down!,"As Kane's story begins, he starts off with a traumatic beating he took at a young age by three unknown teenagers. The beating left him temporarily bruised and mentally scarred for the rest of his life. He goes on to describe many other bullying events or fights that happened in his life as well. I was utterly shocked at the beating he took as a child from unknown teenagers, for NO apparent reason.

He goes on to describe how he got into the movie business and he also tells the real story about how he got 3rd degree burns over 50% of his body. Honestly, it was very emotional for me to read...I look up to him for the fact that he was able to get through it all and make something of himself, as well as help others with their burns.

Kane goes on to talk about his strange OCD habits and movies he's worked on as well as different people he's worked with in the industry..and in the last few chapters he goes on to tell different stories from the sets of the Friday The 13th films he worked on as well as stories from the sets of Hatchet 1 & 2 and Frozen. Mainly they are stories about all the jokes he played on people during filming...and trust me there are a lot. Seeing that he's such a big jokester I'm sure he probably left out a ton.

If you are a fan of Kane's you need to read this!

Todd Ebert,4.0 out of 5 stars,Learning in Graphical Models (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning),"Recommended, but not the place to begin","The title of the book is somewhat misleading, in that most of the research papers involve advanced issues concerning one particular graphical model, namely the Bayesian network. For this reason I highly recommend, as a prerequisite to this book, Finn Jensen's ""Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs"". Jensen's book is adequate in giving a good introduction and overview of the subject, but not sufficient for calling oneself an ""expert"" upon successfully digesting it.
To its credit, ""Learning in Graphical Models"" has several well-written and interesting papers, but the tutorial papers just did not seem enough of an introduction for me to feel comfortable using it as a first source of introduction.
What I find most compelling about Bayesian networks is the fact that they seem both highly modular (which facilitates reusability and network interconnectivity) and can be designed in a semi-rational manner (contrast this with neural-network architectures for which few good algorithms exist for determining size and number of layers). For this reason I imagine they will be important players in future engineering projects that require learning and adaptation.",33
Iftekhar Naim,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning in Graphical Models (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning),Good book for machine learning and graphical models,"The book contains a nice collection of papers relevant to Graphical models and machine learning.

However, I found the book to be useful because of its organization, logical flow and compilation of very relevant and useful papers related to the field.",1
A. Oliver,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects,Good book if you are familiar with the basics of OpenCV,"I'm one of the authors of the book Practical Computer Vision with SimpleCV. The original reason we wrote the book was we felt OpenCV was lacking a lot of 'real world' type of examples that the average programmer could pick up without having to have a complex in-depth knowledge of Computer Vision. I feel this book does a very good job at that as well. Each chapter is basically it's own example with various computer vision techniques applied. I also appreciate the authors have posted all the code online for download and testing it the code compiled without any issues (Ubuntu 12.04). I definitely recommend this book if you are new to OpenCV or even interested in learning some of the basics of programming computer vision, although you should probably also have a bit of programming experience as well to actually understand what the code is doing.",13
Daniel Lee,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects,Nice end-to-end cookbook for computer vision with OpenCV,"The book starts off by stating that it's intended for people with at least a bit of OpenCV knowledge and programming experience, and that rather than its aim is to show how to put together whole projects rather than explaining the theoretical background behind what you're doing. It's definitely correct in describing its target audience, and for the most part the focus is on implementation rather than theory. If you're looking for some examples of how to work with OpenCV as an all-around solution, this is a great collection for you.

A big plus is that for the most part it uses the new OpenCV C++ interface. I say ""mostly"" because the authors also demonstrate projects for mobile devices - one for Android and one for iOS, which I really enjoyed reading.

If you're looking for theory, you will find a bit in this book, but not much. I found the level that things were explained quite good, because you could understand what the code in the book does, but didn't necessarily have to be able to implement or understand the math behind them. The theoretical explanations have varying quality - sometimes they're right on the money, easy to understand and precisely relevant for what you're doing, and sometimes it's more than necessary. For the most part, I thought the authors did a good job of explaining what they were doing and why without forcing the reader to mire through lots of computer vision explanations that might not be interesting for somebody who's just wanting to implement a project that uses computer vision techniques. In every chapter, it was clear that the author really knew what he was talking about and many explanations you'll find in this book will be more concise and clear than what you'll find elsewhere.

From a programming standpoint, the book is a bit of a potpourri. There are lots of really good tips for working with OpenCV in general and the authors always point you to further documetation. Also, besides the full example code used in the book, there are some nice utilities included that you might want to use for your own projects. A few chapters have very concise, clear code that's easy to follow and well-designed. In other places I felt that the code was much more quick and dirty. There's some using directives, which are a pet peeve for me, as well as really big try blocks, writing to globals, and unnecessary casting. In a lot of places, you'll notice the authors using the functions from the old C interface, even though they're writing in C++. In some places, you'll also find that the code is a bit redundant and difficult to extend, but that might actually be an advantage for a beginner who's more interested in seeing how to get something done than understanding complex but elegant design patterns. Taken as a whole, there is some nice code in the book, but there's also some very ugly code here too, depending on what part you're reading. It all implements the algorithms described in the chapters, however, and that is the focus of the book. It's definitely not a collection of best programming practices, but on the other hand, that's not what it's trying to be. You will find good recipes that contain lots of examples that you can apply to your own code, and they're explained well enough to make that easy for you too.

I encourage you to read all the chapters of this book if you buy it. I read it with the intent of learning some techniques for my own projects, but although I could have done that by reading just a few chapters, I was glad to have read the whole thing. There are good tips and examples for working with OpenCV in general, and I found the sections on head pose estimation and face recognition very inspiring for my own work, even though I don't work with facial recognition at all. The book may not be a programming guide, but it definitely is a guide to computer vision and it shows you how to get very, very far, just by using OpenCV. It was well worth my time.",4
Kevin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects,Must Read if you are into Computer Vision,"Of all the book reviews I’ve done this is the most genuine because I actually found this book useful for work I was doing. They found the right level of being technically interesting, robust and substantial all the while without being too daunting. The source code that accompanies this book is great and I still check back to it when starting new projects ([...]). Its well written and won’t take long to read through – I think it is a worthwhile read for anyone doing computer vision work. Program design isn’t something a lot of computer vision researchers / developers think or talk about a lot (at least in my experience) so to see how others lay out the problem can really help with your own work.",1
Ido Shvartsman,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects,"Interesting Projects, Could do with more in-depth explanations of the more complicated algorithms","The book contains a variety of different mini-projects, some simple, some extremely complicated. All are interesting and generally well presented. The only problem I have with this book is that the truly complex ones (such as chapter 6) could have used some deeper explanation of the math and algorithms used. Of course that would have meant the book had be either much bigger, or drop some of the chapters. In other words, it's a bit unclear if this is a book covering Computer Vision algorithms or OpenCV functionality - it tries to be both, and succeeds only partially.
Bottom line - a good departure point for experienced OpenCV programmers who want to start their own projects.",1

rivantsov,5.0 out of 5 stars,Parsing Techniques: A Practical Guide (Monographs in Computer Science),"Absolutely recommend it, easier than any other LR/LALR explanation","I will talk only about LR/LALR algorithms coverage - this is my personal focus. I'm the creator of Irony parser kit, and this book was my guidance in implementation of efficient LALR automaton construction. The Dragon book is quite dated today, there had been much new research and advancement in parsing algorithm since dragon times. Like DeRemer/Penello algorithm and its variations - it is much more efficient than original method described in Dragon book. I first tried to understand DeRemer/Penello reading academic papers, but did not quite succeed. Then I discovered this book - it was my savior! The algorithm is carefully explained on several pages, step by step, using clear and helpful diagrams. I carefully reproduced the algorithm in code, and got almost 10-fold perf increase compared to old dragon method.
Note that the book covers many other algorithms and parser types, and I'm sure readers interested in them would find excellent coverage. This is one of the nice things about this book - you can pick up a chapter covering your particular area, and read it, without need to read the entire book from start to end. It works as an excellent detailed reference on wide variety of parsing techniques.",7
Joshua Haberman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Parsing Techniques: A Practical Guide (Monographs in Computer Science),"The clearest, most comprehensive survey of the field","I have spent the last six months of my life learning as much as I can about parsing. I own half a shelf of compiler books, and I have flipped through the pages of half a shelf more.

No other book approaches the clarity and comprehensiveness of this book.

When you try to read most literature about parsing, authors tend to throw around a lot of terms without explaining them. What exactly is a ""deterministic"" parser, a ""canonical"" parser, a ""directional"" parser? Grune and Jacobs explain every one of these distinctions lucidly, and put all known algorithms in context of how they compare to the rest of the field. How do the algorithms compare in what languages they can parse, how fast they are, and how much of the work can be done ahead of time? The book addresses all of these trade-offs, but doesn't stop at asymptotic complexity: in chapter 17 (the comparative survey), they note that general parsers may be a factor of ten or so slower than deterministic methods, even though both are linear. This high-level overview and comparative survey are something I was desperately seeking, and I've found nothing comparable to them anywhere.

There is also a lot of important background information that other authors tend to assume you know: for example, did you know that when authors say ""LL"" they almost always mean ""strong LL"" unless they specifically say ""full LL?"" Are you totally clear on the difference between strong LL, simple LL, and full LL? If you're not sure, Grune and Jacobs will give you all the explanation you need to fully understand.

This book strikes a perfect balance between breadth and depth. All significant algorithms are covered, most with enough detail to fully understand and implement them, but Grune and Jacobs punt on less practical material like proofs or rigorous formal descriptions. That information is never more than a citation away though, thanks to the 417-entry annotated bibliography, which gives you not only references to source material but a paragraph or two describing their key results.

I couldn't be happier about adding this book to my bookshelf of compiler books -- it quickly became the book I refer to most often, and I thank Grune and Jacobs for this superb guide to this vast and diverse field of computer science.",70
Roger Costello,5.0 out of 5 stars,Parsing Techniques: A Practical Guide (Monographs in Computer Science),This book has rocked my world,"In my life I have read, perhaps, 20 books that have profoundly changed my world.

1. Parsing Techniques by Dick Grune and Ceriel Jacobs

Not only is it packed with clearly explained
information, but it is written in an eloquent,
almost poetic way. As I read it I continually
find myself saying, ""Wow, wow, wow!."" The
authors clearly have a mastery of the English
language.

2. Introduction to Graph Theory by Richard Trudeau

The author claims that many students get bored
with mathematics because the mathematics is
tied to applications. He says that students should
learn pure mathematics: let's take some very
simple ideas and see where we can go with them.
This totally blew me away. This is an unbelievably
awesome book.",4

Barron Laycock,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Cult of Information: A Neo-Luddite Treatise on High-Tech, Artificial Intelligence, and the True Art of Thinking",A Full-Broadsided Body Punch To Conventional Wisdom!,"This book is a thoughtful and thought-provoking examination of both the meaning of and the consequences associated with the rising computer information cult within contemporary society. Roszak is a skilled writer and an even more perceptive thinker. He quickly disposes of the contemporary idea equating data or information, on the one hand, with knowledge and wisdom, on the other hand. He despairs of the notion that technological progress is an unalloyed blessing, and provides a lot of supporting documentation illustrating that for all those capabilities we gain through the use of digital technology, for example, we also lose important capabilities and perspectives.
According to Roszak, we have now come to almost rely on exclusively rational,""logical"", and quantifiable methods of understanding everything around us, often to the detriment of ignoring more traditional and time-honored methods of knowing. This, in turn, leads to a very narrow perspective of how it is that the world operates, one devoid of anything not quantitative, anything comprised of more ""qualitative"" means of observation. Thus, to the digitally oriented logical and rational mind, anything not disposed to undertanding through calculation and the scientific method simply is not real. Furthermore, he shows us, such digital computing techniques creates as many problems as it solves.
He fears for good reason that we are falling into a hyperbolized and superficial culture where we have come to completely depend on scientific rationalism as it is depicted by the media, and that this creates a conundrum we cannot escape from, since many of the problems associated with modern society stem from this increasingly exlusively scientific and rational approach toward problem-solving.
As with other contemporary critics of the new Digital Intelligence cult like social critic Neil Postman, Roszak argues for a more comprehensive perspective , one that places the tools of computer technology at the behest of a more broad-based intelligence, one that recognizes that there is a whole range of ways of knowing and understanding that those contained in programming code. This is a provocative and thought-indicing book. I enjoyed and learned from it, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching a superior intellect at work, and who also appreciated the thread of a finely-hewn intellectual argument. Enjoy!",51
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Cult of Information: A Neo-Luddite Treatise on High-Tech, Artificial Intelligence, and the True Art of Thinking",An exercise in cynicism and sarcasm.,"This book is interesting not because of its arguments and philosophy but for the fact that the author attacks all areas that might be construed to make use of information theory. The computer, he claims, has taken the place of the emperor, and he aims to expose it as naked, to speak up and protect the ""public"" against the misinformation and propanda that is propagated by certain ""elements"" of our society. All fields of expertise that use the computer, be it financial engineering, simulation and modeling, bioinformatics, and especially artificial intelligence are attacked for their exaggerations and wishful thinking. The author's approach is deeply cynical, full of biting sarcasm, and with only a few exceptions, there are no coherent, scientific arguments to support the author's views. In particular, he makes claims on the nature of human intelligence and the human mind that are totally unsupported and mystical in nature. Ironically, his amplification of human mental abilities is comparable to that of the ""information cultists"" he criticizes.
The author claims that the abilities of the computer have been over-advertised, but he confuses the content of the advertising with the beliefs of the individuals who promote it. In this hyper-competitive society, every firm has to advertise to get noticed, to get its point across. Such huckstering is done for business reasons, and yes, is sometimes exaggerated. But the inaccurate claims of the advertising, if any, should not cause one to believe that they are held in the minds of the those who invented the product. But the author will have none of this, for his goal is to protect the ""public"" against these false claims (regardless if they ask for his help).
Financial engineering and derivatives trading are not left out of the criticism. Apparently the author does not believe in the use of the human mind which he has set out to save, for it is by using it that creative financial instruments are invented, with the intent of reducing risk. Financial engineers are ""hackers"" though, responsible for the 1987 stock market collapse, and the derivative is an ""Alice in Wonderland"" concept, a ""financial hydrogen bomb"". The author quotes sources for these claims, but no explicit evidence whatsoever is given for his assertion that derivatives are devastating to the economy. Such evidence would be very interesting for those who work in financial engineering.
The author's view of thinking machines as not living up to the ""megahype"" is just plain wrong, along with his belief that those who are behind this technology are duped by wishful thinking. The reverse is true in fact, as AI researchers are usually the last to acknowledge the claim that what they have built does exhibit some sort of intelligence. If they make outlandish and overly-optimistic claims, it is because of their doubts, and not of their confidence. The difficulties and let-downs of research require sometimes periodic shot-in-the-arms. But again, the author feels the need to protect the ""public"" against their inflated claims.
One can expect more neo-Luddite books like this in the years to come, primarily from those who are having difficulty comprehending the true nature of the technology and science behind the information age. The ""public"" though will not be writing these books, nor do they need them. The overwhelming majority of the world's citizens are intelligent enough to judge for themselves what is confronting them. The advertising will continue along with the research and development. The machines will get smarter and smarter with each passing year. Imperfections will exist in these machines as they do in the humans who brought them about. One can imagine though the possibility that the machines will themselves begin to write books that offer arguments for the intelligence of their authors. Such a prospect is awesome.",7
awangenh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute Beginner's Guide to Building Robots,not necessarily written with good pedagogic in mind,"A scattered collection of projects, not necessarily up to date technologically, not necessarily written with good pedagogic in mind. There are some really good chapters, such as Branwyn's interpretation of the insect-like walker of Gerome Demers, that are lost in the middle of the other, rather less well-written and useful chapters. If it were a free compilation of postings on Instructables, I would say: ""Wow! Someone has put a lot of things, olden and new, together. Thanks!"". As a book you have to pay for, it's not worth.

Besides (and here I think Amazon is to blame), the content indexing in the .azw e-Book is miserable: it is a technical textbook. you have to be able to find things, you have to be able to easily jump back and forth between subsections of chapters, and this does not work for this book on the Kindle. The chapters are long, and the only thing you can do is jump between entire chapters or to go page-wise back and forth (the text search on the Kindle is not something you'll want to use).

T. Dokland,3.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute Beginner's Guide to Building Robots,"Explicit instructions for building robots, but low on explanation","This is a nice introduction to robot building and the instructions for building the three projects included in the book are very explicit and easy to follow. The introductory chapters on different types of robots and the history of robotics are interesting, but not particularly useful in terms of learning how to build robots. The section on parts and tools and the appendix with sources for components are invaluable, however. My main gripe with this book is that it doesn't explain how the robots actually work. Perhaps that is beyond the very basics, but as someone who is fairly familiar with electronics, though without experience in robot building, the book left me dying to know how the control circuits of the robot projects actually work. There is not even a circuit diagram shown, so you are left to blindly follow the exact instructions without really understanding why you are doing what you do. That being said, you will be left with three cute robots at the end of the day, and it does serve its purpose well, as a basic introduction to robots that will possibly leave you wanting to learn more or go deeper into the field of robotics.",8

Its true though for the most part but just a weird book, like a book telling you Santa isn't real so just get over it. Let me save you the time and money by summing up this entire book in one sentence. ""How to build a robot: you cant really"".",1
Eduardo X,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommender Systems: An Introduction,Best introduction,"I've been studying recomender systems for my Bsc degree in the last two years and I've spent lots of money reading many other books. This book is the cheaper one on my library and I'm so pleased about the content and the way the authors explain things. I know most people doesn't like math and I believe you shouldn't read about this subject but, even if you math weaker, you can have this book.

I'm saying that because I had other books, for example:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3540720782/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3790821330/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i02

Those ones are good but didn't fulfill my desires.

Besides, it is easy to read and understand the concepts, I felt it gave me a good understand of the recomender system universe. I agree that this is the first step. But this first step is so dense that the second step seems so far away.",6
H. Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommender Systems: An Introduction,The Best Introductory Book about Recommendations,"I am referring to this book for my lectures and this book is fascinating.
First of all, this book is really well-written. The authors explained recommendation technology concepts in an easy-to-follow way. At the same time, they didn't miss the most up-to-date research topics.

Second, all the writers are world's leading researchers of recommendations.
Therefore, they are good to lead readers to more focal points. I like the bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter.

Lastly, by introducing toy examples in every chapter, readers are able to easily comprehend each technology. Actually, this part is my favorite. I think this book is between a reference book of recommendation-related rationales and practical programming books like Manning series or O'Reilly's.

I already made my mind to choose this book as a textbook of my course in the next semester.",12

XY,4.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents,interesting,"This book presents an ingenious nine dimensional taxonomy of the design space for a computational agent, which I'll call the PM (Poole-Mackworth) taxonomy. Unfortunately, after presenting this taxonomy in chapter 1, it is not directly referenced again until chapter 15, the final chapter. My preference would be that the PM taxonomy be referenced constantly throughout the book, for example by reference to appropriate nine-dimensional spider diagrams. Relationships between topics would be represented as relationships between points on the PM spider diagram, and transitions between topics would be described accordingly. Any proposed AI taxonomy will only be generally accepted if it is shown to be useful, and this book does not try very hard to demonstrate the utility of the PM taxonomy. The need for a useful taxonomy for AI is demonstrated by one of this book's main competitors, the encyclopedic Russell-Norvig book. The 'everything but the kitchen sink' approach employed in the Russell-Norvig book is intellectually unsatisfying; a future edition of Poole-Mackworth's book has the potential to bring some much-needed order to the field of AI.",13

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Algebraic Geometry and Statistical Learning Theory (Cambridge Monographs on Applied and Computational Mathematics),Excellent,"Statistical learning theory is now a well-established subject, and has found practical use in artificial intelligence as well as a framework for studying computational learning theory. There are many fine books on the subject, but this one studies it from the standpoint of algebraic geometry, a field which decades ago was deemed too esoteric for use in the real world but is now embedded in myriads of applications. More specifically, the author uses the resolution of singularities theorem from real algebraic geometry to study statistical learning theory when the parameter space is highly singular. The clarity of the book is outstanding and it should be of great interest to anyone who wants to study not only statistical learning theory but is also interested in yet another application of algebraic geometry. Readers will need preparation in real and functional analysis, and some good background in algebraic geometry, but not necessarily at the level of modern approaches to the subject. In fact, the author does not use algebraic geometry over algebraically closed fields (only over the field of real numbers), and so readers do not need to approach this book with the heavy machinery that is characteristic of most contemporary texts and monographs on algebraic geometry. The author devotes some space in the book for a review of the needed algebraic geometry.

Also reviewed in the initial sections of the book are the concepts from statistical learning theory, including the very important method of comparing two probability density functions: the Kullback-Leibler distance (called relative entropy in the physics literature). The reader will have to have a good understanding of functional analysis to follow the discussion, being able to appreciate for example the difference between convergence in different norms on function space. From a theoretical standpoint, learning can be different in different norms, a fact that becomes readily apparent throughout the book (from a practical standpoint however, it is difficult to distinguish between norms, due to the finiteness of all data sets). Of particular importance in early discussion is the need for ""singular"" statistical learning theory, which as the author shows, boils down to finding a mathematical formalism that can cope with learning problems where the Fisher information matrix is not positive definite (in this case there is no guarantee that unbiased estimators will be available). This is where (real) algebraic geometry comes in, for it allows the removal of the singularities in parameter space by recursively using ""blow-up"" (birational) maps. The author lists several examples of singular theories, such as hidden Markov models, Boltzmann machines, and Bayesian networks. The author also shows to generalize some of the standard constructions in ""ordinary"" or ""regular"" statistical learning to the case of singular theories, such as the Akaike information criterion and Bayes information criterion. Some of the definitions he makes are somewhat different than what some readers are used to, such as the notion of stochastic complexity. In this book it is defined merely as the negative logarithm of the `evidence', whereas in information theory it is a measure of the code length of a sequence of data relative to a family of models. The methods for calculating the stochastic complexity in both cases are similar of course.

In singular theories, one must deal with such things as the divergence of the maximum likelihood estimator and the failure of asymptotic normality. The author shows how to deal with these situations after the singularities are resolved, and he gives a convincing argument as to why his strategies are generic enough to cover situations where the set of singular parameters, i.e. the set where the Fisher information matrix is degenerate, has measure zero. In this case, he correctly points out that one still needs to know if the true parameter is contained in the singular set, and this entails dealing with ""non-generic"" situations using hypothesis testing, etc.

Examples of singular learning machines are given towards the end of the book, one of these being a hidden Markov model, while another deals with a multilayer perceptron. The latter example is very important since the slowness in learning in multilayer perceptrons is widely encountered in practice (largely dependent on the training samples). The author shows how this is related to the singularities in the parameter space from which the learning is sampled, even when the true distribution is outside of the parametric model, where the collection of parameters is finite. This example leads credence to the motto that ""singularities affect learning"" and the author goes on further to show to what extent this is a ""universal"" phenomenon. By this he means that having only a ""small"" number of training samples will bring out the complexity of the singular parameter space; increasing the number of training samples brings out the simplicity of the singular parameter space. He concludes from this that the singularities make the learning curve smaller than any nonsingular learning machine. Most interestingly, he speculates that ""brain-like systems utilize the effect of singularities in the real world.""",35

Bradford W. Miller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Automated Planning: Theory & Practice (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence),Excellent presentation that fills a void,"Until this book, possibly the only comprehensive treatment of planning has been a paper collection: Readings in Planning (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Representation and Reasoning). What these authors have done is phenominal - they've marshalled a bibliography of 565 publications into a comprehensive treatment from a common point of view. That makes it much easier to analyze different approaches to planning, as well as to see how various application domains have applied these approaches to solve real problems.

The first 448 pages of the book discusses various planning approaches, from classical state-space planning including recent improvements in the STRIPS model (GraphPlan), to dealing with temporal operations and resource scheduling. They then use the readers understanding of these deterministic approaches to bridge to planning under uncertainty, which is where planning meets the ""real world"" of imperfect knowledge, observability or even actions having unintended effects. The next roughly 100 pages goes into application domains discussing how space applications, robotics, manufacturing, emergency evacuation and even the game of bridge has used these planning methods to give the reader better intuitions on their own domain.

Finally some minority approaches such as case-based planning and plan related areas such as plan recognition are introduced briefly, leading to tutorial appendices on search (and complexity), first order logic, and model checking.

I have been working on the periphery of planning research for over 25 years, including (currently) directing advanced research in adversarial planning (a topic not addressed by this book, but that's hardly surprising given the novelty of the approach ;-). This is the best overview and reference I've seen to date for this very important area.",13
W. Ghost,4.0 out of 5 stars,Automated Planning: Theory & Practice (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence),"Good book, but could be better","The book is good, covers a lot and is very clear.

The downside: there are some small errors and mistakes.For example, the authors define gamma: SxAxE -> 2^S as the transition function, where S is the state space, A is the set of actions, E is the set of events. Later they say that if there are no events to be considered from the outside world, then you could use E={} (empty set) -- Assumption A3, page 10. Although this is intuitively OK, it is mathematically flawed, because the cartesian product of anything with {} is {}.
Planning with MDPs and specially with POMDPs deserves more attention. In particular, the very short commentary on planning with POMDPs mentions that it is not possible to solve big POMDPs. This is not true anymore; there are very good heuristics for POMDP solving currently.
I think more theorems could have been presented and proved, and some advanced sections could be added to each chapter (some authors include a section with a star, for example)
I also don't like the way pseudo-code is presented, but that is a matter of taste.

It would also be nice if the examples in chapter 2 were fully specified. That helps a lot to understand how problems are represented.

On the good side, there are LOTS of examples for each definition, and there are exercises at the end of each chapter (more exercises would be nice, actually). I also like the discussion and historical remarks at the end of chapters.

Cecilia Marcano,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beginning 3D Game Development with Unity 4: All-in-one, multi-platform game development (Technology in Action)",Great Book for a Great Game Building Tool,"I recommend buying this book for 3 reasons. First because how it is written. Second because the content and scope of the book. Third because of Unity 3D.

1) The book is really well written, it invites you to explore Unity and get familiar with the Interface and concepts, which is the only way you will really learn. The book does not read as programming book, it reads more like a book for learning an application, like reading a content creation software book. As other reviewer said, the author assumes nothing about previous knowledge or experience of the reader, so there is a lot of information and explanations to help you get the tasks done. At times this detail may seem too much for a seasoned developer, but for a beginner its perfect,
2) The book is targeted to beginners audience, and does a great job on that regard. You will learn by creating a Point and Click 3D Adventure, which may be not be your favorite genre, but it does not matter, this will serve very well the purpose of teaching.
3) Unity 3D is simply great, I kind of regret not learning it sooner. I have followed Unity from its creation, but back then I choose to learn XNA and develop for the PC and XBOX 360 Indie Games. But then the iOS games and Facebook games took over the game world. Suddenly it made no sense to learn platform specific languages or technologies. I tried to learn Unreal with the UDK, but found it kind of complex. My advice to anyone learning how to create video games is to learn Unity, because at the present moment the ability to deploy to iOS, Android, Mac OS, Linux, Wii U, and all the Microsoft's OS including Windows Phone; is simply mandatory if you really want any chance of success.",21

The language used is Javascript, but if you already have a working knowledge of C# it's quite easy to convert her code on the fly - especially since most of the work in Unity is done by Unity's libraries. transform.Rotate is the same in C# and Javascript.

Her text is clear and concise, very rarely wandering off into the wilderness. The ""wasted space"" [my opinion, obviously] of every game development book (history of gaming, how to manage, etc.) is tight with only one chapter. After that it's a rush of knowledge and how-to.",10

Pros

- Mostly easy to follow
- Very beginner friendly
- follows a logical progression
- lots of screenshots
- covers ancillary content like forums, asset shop, documentation, and Unity Answers
- good coding style

Cons

- Errors left, right, and sideways, there is absolutely no way the author recreated the project while going through the book, some of the errors are game stopping and would be noticed by ANYONE doing it.

You will notice there are a lot more pros than cons. However, that one con is so bad, it overshadows the pros by a good margin. I was working through this book with a man from australia, as we met on the Unity forums looking for answers to errata. He ended up giving up on the book by chapter 9 when the book references an object in a scene that had never been created or imported. A good chunk of the chapter involves this object that sort of just spawns out of no where. This is the type of error I mean, once fixed, the rest of the surrounding book is amazing, but there are so many of these seemingly random errors that it makes it tough.

The real unfortunate part is that this is a book for beginners, who are unlikely to go to the Unity forums for help. Granted the author at least tells the readers to do this often in the beginning chapters. This book minus errata would be a 5 star easily for me. If you are an experienced coder or artist, can navigate forums, and can troubleshoot, this will be a decent book for you as a beginner to Unity. If you are new to the former, or don't want to be forced to pay for a book that you have to find answers to errors for, then you should probably find another book.

It appears, as of the time of this writing, that Sue has stopped posting in here thread on the forum, so it is mostly readers helping each other out. I've always felt the 5 star system left a lot to be desired. I can never seem to decide on which star to give, but with this book, it is a solid 3 star, and I mean that wholeheartedly. Again, i really feel bad, because if she proofread the book it would have been so much better.

Also, just as a warning to readers, the version of Unity has changed since the writing of this book. The errors I am referring to are not a result of this change. Although, it should be noted that some things have changed and will require minor investigation by the reader.",12

Sean A.

It is basically the only textbook that covers so much of computational linguistics, so I have had no choice but to use it for the past several years. Just the same, I'd rather not use it for teaching linguistics students. While the book has much to offer the professional, including a broad range of topics extensively researched, it is much more useful in this ""handbook"" capacity than as a textbook for the uninitiated. The chief reasons for this are: 1) It is pedagogically very poor; the majority of concepts are either explained in a confusing and obfuscatory manner or are not explained and are simply left in algorithmic form. This is not usually edifying to the linguistics student with no computer science background. 2) There are too many mistakes in its algorithms and method overviews. So far as I can see, even the famed Earley parsing algorithm is wrong here, it will not yield the correct output. 3) It is not written in a language that linguistics students can understand. With no background in mathematics, computer science, or pseudocode, such students need much more coddling than is provided by this book, and they are virtually unable to read it.

CONCLUSION: Get this book if you are looking for a good overview of the field. The book will introduce you to a thousand of topics. As soon as you need in-depth coverage of some particular topic, you will look for additional resources.",35
Brian Du Preez,3.0 out of 5 stars,Building Machine Learning Systems with Python,Quite Frustrating... but a helpful author.,"Edit:
Willi Richert, has been quite helpful and has looked at the issues I was having and resolved some of them, so especially if you are working on Windows, make sure you get the code from GitHub.
I have not returned to complete working through the rest book as yet, will as soon as I have time.

Original:
To be completely honest I had great hope for this book, it was theoretically exactly what I was looking for, a practical guide to getting up and running with Machine Learning and some of it major Python packages.
But...
From chapter 3, there were code discrepancies between what was in the book, what was supplied and then eventually what I got working...
I am not going to bother going into all the errors / issues, the 2 major ones that made me ""shelve"" the book and start looking for new study material:
1. After the 9GB download for chapter 5, the supplied source doesn't work and contains requirements to 32bit libs... huge waste of time...
2. After moving onto in chapter 6, and after 24 hours of downloading tweets for sentiment analysis... I checked the files and they only contained ""The Twitter REST API v1 is no longer active. Please migrate to API v1.1"".

Yes, I could go debug and fix the code / errors in other peoples code... but that is not how I want to spend my time learning a new subject, I have enough of that in my day job as a software developer :)",62

I can't seem to get through any of it as the code doesn't work in most cases.

Subhrajit Bhattacharya,3.0 out of 5 stars,Building Machine Learning Systems with Python,Hands on approach to ML using Python. Thats great - but thats where the greatness ends,"I can not understand how so many people have given this book a 4 or 5 rating. 3 is the max that can be given.

This book has a hands on approach to ML using python. Which is great. But thats where the greatness ends.

1. The explanations in the book in general are sketchy and not thorough.

2. They use code snippets in the book. Complete code has to be downloaded. However the way the code snippets are explained
does little to help understand the complete code. It's better to read the complete code directly.

3. The code is not portable. I had to make some modifications to make some of the routines work.

4. In some cases I just could not make the code work.

5. They do not explain the scikit and numpy routines at a decent level of detail. So you are often left wondering how the code works,
and then you have to read the scikit or numpy routine to figure this out.

6. There are several perl files for a given chapter. I have no idea in which sequence to go through them.

If you are a decent python programmer, and you have decent knowledge of numpy and scikits, then you will probably not find the book very frustrating. Otherwise, be ready to be frustrated.

I think the reason this book is still selling is its cheap, and i think there is nothing better available.

There a few books which directly discus scikits-learn. Maybe people should look at them.",1

nyceyes,4.0 out of 5 stars,Building Machine Learning Systems with Python,A very good book ...,"I took one star off because Packt Publishing is regularly sloppy with respect to quality assurance (errata) and editing. They also need to end the practice of cramming code snippets that end up so unreadable. Doing it correctly would only add several pages to the text.

I offer this Thumbs-Up review with years writing experience: When, in the process of transferring an environment that I've designed and built to ops personnel, I many times had to write thick documents that encompassed many layers: describing the theory; conjuring up examples and analogies to cement concepts; inserting diagrams at key locations to bring points home; context switching between the overall subject and providing quick tutorials on underlying tools used; spending time showing how not to do something, and then showing how to do it; and of course writing good English -- i.e. in an understandable way, which requires a lot of re-edits. A small example of what I mean (something that took me a solid week to write) is here: didata.us/2014/06/11/logistic-regression-machine-learning
That said, the authors of this book did a splendid job weaving through all of those layers, in what I'm sure was a tight time frame: theory versus practical; right versus wrong way; a little numpy, a little statistical concepts; dreaming up examples, which are not trivial; and so on. They couldn't cover everything, of course... No book today has the completeness and calibre of a Richard W. Stallings TCP/IP Volume I, II, and III book. But you can write a book that, while not a bible, provides a lot of information and pointers that you hope the initiated reader will run with. The authors here did that well.

You can forgive my 1-star deduction. That falls on Packt Publishing.",2

You get to know and appreciate the complex, talented characters of the story at IBM and in Hollywood. The growing sense of drama makes the book un-put-downable. Will IBM's engineers prepare Watson to figure out the pun-filled, playful and quirky categories of Jeopardy? Will the Hollywood execs agree to fair terms of engagement? And, most intriguingly, who will win the final showdown?

I love what Baker's publisher has done with the Kindle version of this book - making the first 11 chapters available well before the showdown Jeopardy match airs on Feb. 14-15-16. After the actual match took place, in great secrecy, Baker wrote the final chapter of his book, which will arrive as a Kindle download the day after the final match, when the hardcover will also be available, with all the chapters. This is a fantastic use of e-book technology, so bravo to Houghton Mifflin for such a clever and Kindle-friendly innovation.

When I first heard about Watson, I was very interested in what they were doing. I thought this book would be the perfect source to learn more.

It is written fantastically and is fun to read, but it does not go into the technology too much, which is what I was looking for. Still, I enjoyed reading and learning. I had no idea how many problems there were with both the technology and the business aspect of the program. The book goes into the areas of logic and AI as well, and gives some history of IBM and its chess-playing computer of the past.

Anyone who's looking for a nice, easy read should take a look at this book. Techies: It probably won't fill your needs in terms of describing the technology, but it's still fun to read. There isn't any other source as complete as this on Watson. Take a look!",10

Mark Loves Kindle Books,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Final Jeopardy: The Story of Watson, the Computer That Will Transform Our World","a must read, a fascinating read, and an easy read - all in one!`","Just an incredible look at the complex world of artificial intelligence, and how hard it is to get a computer to really ""think"" on its own. Along the way we get insights into what kind of intelligence the future will require from humans once machines like Watson become more commonplace, doing some kinds of ""thinking"" for us (like calculators replaced sliderules ... what's next?). It's all rolled into a fabulous tale that plays out like a sports book recounting a championship season.

We won't know if Watson won till Feb 14-16 but if you read this book you'll know what went into the match. As a bonus, this is one of the best uses of ebooks and Kindles ever -- buy the Kindle edition now and get the final chapter (an analysis of the match) as soon as its over FREE!

I. J. Galea,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Final Jeopardy: The Story of Watson, the Computer That Will Transform Our World",Informative and Entertaining,"How will computing evolve? Is it through a superior and elegant ""artificial intelligence"", with robots getting to think ever so closely as humans? Or is it through a brute force method, essentially taking advantage of the innate strengths of a computing machine?

This question is at the root of this book. The new machine ""Watson"" is a step forward to nudging the answer towards the brute force route. Getting an answer by checking millions of alternatives and identifying the best fit might not be elegant. But it works. And it has the potential of being extremely useful to human activity.

Stephen Baker does a brilliant job recounting the story of how the machine ""Watson"" came into being. He provides an excellent context of what ""Watson"" represents to the overall intellectual computing effort. This is intrinsically a human story: rather than machines taking over humans as some have fancied, this is a story of how smart scientistis collaborate together to create something new. Along the way, it is hard not to feel admiration for the human genius underpinning all this development.

Informative and entertaining, a very well written account of an important step in the computing evolution.",1

Daniel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Final Jeopardy: The Story of Watson, the Computer That Will Transform Our World",Fun & uniquely informative.,"If you enjoyed seeing Watson on TV or YouTube and want to know more about it, you will definitely like this book. The book is a fun read that explains AI aspects very intuitively while detailing the human drama of developing Watson in a race against time. The author entertains with insider surprises throughout the book, such as IBM's temporary fear that a hacker in a garage could humiliate IBM by building something comparable to Watson's Jeopardy abilities.

Though Watson's ""secret sauce"" of algorithms will remain an IBM secret, the book does a lot to explain the basics of how Watson formulates answers and the potential applications of such technology. As the story unfolds, it shows why a lot of engineering and trial-and-error was required to go from academic research to developing Watson. I also enjoyed seeing formal AI concepts explained very intuitively, such as seeing ontologies likened to ""cheat sheets.""

Regarding job fears, the author shows that if your job primarily consists of finding and relaying information, such as working in a help center or performing data analysis, then it will become increasingly important to focus on what computers are not able to do, such as creatively generating ideas and theories.

For those wanting more technical details about Watson, the bibliography includes this online article by the IBM team: ""Building Watson: An Overview of the DeepQA Project."" There is also more info at the author's blog, finaljeopardy.net.",3

J. Thurmond,5.0 out of 5 stars,Robot Building for Beginners,Just what I've been looking for!,"I looked around quite a bit trying to find a robot building book that would take my 14 yr old through the process in a way he could understand. David Cook delivered perfectly. Every other book I looked at seemed either too childish, or alternately, assumed a solid background in electronics. Robot Building for Beginners, like Baby Bear's porridge, is just right!

I studied philosophy in college, so can offer my son no help in building robots. I've seen this book described as a swimming pool that's 5'x5' but 25' deep. That's pretty apt. I like the extensive chapter on components - what they are, how they work - neither my son nor I knew a resistor from a diode before. Also an entire chapter on safety was great from the concerned parent perspective.

The book is long, but covers a lot of ground with very little fluff. In 10 days my son had read up to the chapter where you start building your robot - he had absorbed a ton of information, built a few basic circuits and tested/troubleshot them with a multimeter. Now he's just waiting impatiently for me to set him up with the necessary components to start building (actually he's started scavenging components from dead/unused electronics he comes across; and I'm starting to fear for my DVD player).

I don't think you'll find a better starting point for a novice.",108
PKen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Robot Building for Beginners,Great beginner book.,"This book was a good intro into robot building with appropriately detailed descriptions about the different electronic components, where to buy parts and some very good troubleshooting tips.

As good as the book was please note that the Solarbotics sandwich robot is a little different from the one described in the book. The Solarbotics robot includes a printed circuit board with all connections prewired and prelabeled. The soldering is tricky for beginners and the troubleshooting of the components once on the board can be significantly more difficult than a breadboard prototype. There are also no instructions for the Solarbotics board which uses different motors and requires some additional trial and error mounting everything in the sandwich container. The picture on the bag of parts shows a professionally mounted design with no instructions for reproducing this - don't expect perfection on your first attempt. That's part of the fun though isn't it?

I'm hooked and will definitely be ordering the followup book in this series.

Freyja's Books,5.0 out of 5 stars,Robot Building for Beginners,Perfect for what it's intended to do,"This book is perfect for what it is intended to do, which is to teach someone that's never built a robot before how to do it.

Having done the first project in Absolute Beginner's Guide to Building Robots as well, I can definitely say that this is the better FIRST choice, because the other book requires a lot of mechanical skills which I do not have. This book only requires that you follow directions and practice soldering a little before you take on the circuit board here (to get soldering practice, I used the Elenco AmeriKit Learn to Solder Kit).

Having built three or four robots since completing this book, I still feel that the Sandwich robot that this book discusses is still my favorite -- it's neat watching something you built follow a line on the floor, and change its lights to match what it sees on the ground! I've bought the Intermediate sequel to this book and will gladly work on it soon, because I definitely recommend this book.

Tim Daniels,5.0 out of 5 stars,Robot Building for Beginners,Fun Stuff!,"I'm taking a mechatronics and robotics class at Humboldt State University. We were allowed to choose our own project for the semester. I bought this book back in January and read through (devoured) it in just a couple nights. It takes you step by step through a robot building project in a very logical and detailed manner. Some of the material is very basic and was review for me, but I read through it anyway. Mr. Cook explains every single component and what its function is in the 'bot. He even goes so far as to suggest suppliers and what their prices were at the time of writing. His thorough explanations and descriptions will be a recipe to be closely followed by somebody who is just getting their feet wet in assembling ""stuff"" (an entire chapter dedicated just to soldering!). For more seasoned mechanics and tinkerers, he provides room for artistic license and a great foundation for a really cool project.

The semester is drawing to a close, my 'bot mother board is done and functioning, and I'm now building the body/chassis. Though I'm not using the same ""sandwich"" box design Mr. Cook did, I owe him a debt of gratitude for writing such a wonderfully insightful and thorough book.

Nikolaos Abatzis,4.0 out of 5 stars,Robot Building for Beginners,Create a simple robot and lay down the foundations for future ones,"I am providing this feedback in the hope of guiding potential buyer's expectations about the goals of this book. After going through this book you will have:

1. a simple reflex robot (reflex in the sense that it reacts ""naively' to detection of light). This is neither good nor bad, again it depends on your expectations. No coding will be involved and the robot cannot do much else
2. you will learn Ohms law and how it is applied in building this robot's circuit
3. you will learn about basic building blocks and how they work, diodes, resistors, comparators, photoresistors, etc
4. you will accumulate a collection of tools and materials that you can reuse
5. you will learn how to do soldering and machining of some parts

In my opinion this is a book for the long haul. If you want to get up and running really fast the author himself suggest going the Lego route or with other kits that you assemble together quickly. If you want to learn the basic principles and collect the necessary tools to build parts and/or whole robots it is a good place to start. Bare in mind it is a START. If you are serious about robot building you will ultimately gravitate in building parts and circuits based on skills and knowledge the author describes. The book takes you through a lot of basic skills and knowledge and it has a lot of illustrations, actually multiple per step, which I found invaluable.

So no fancy, intelligent robot here, just laying some serious foundations. Make sure that you visit the author's website and you look for the ""sandwich"" the robot being built. It will give you a lot of helpful information such as a shopping list for all the tools, components needed. One big concern is the cost involved. When all the tools and materials are purchased, we are talking about several hundred dollars. Yes most of them will be for materials and tools that you will use in other projects, if you are seriously committed in sticking with this as a hobby. If you are not, take the Lego or other kit route.

I hope this helps and I personally found quite rewarding being able to build the different parts myself and the robot. I already have David's intermediate book and I look forward to the next level of complexity.",5
Randy Forgaard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Robot Building for Beginners,"Extraordinarily informative and fun, terrific for beginners","I am just starting out in robotics, and have read several amateur robotics books. I have some power tools in the garage, I vaguely remember a little bit about electronics from a course I took in college, and I love to build things. But before I read this book, I really didn't know anything about robotics.

This book (and it's follow-on companion, Intermediate Robot Building by the same author) is extraordinarily good. I believe it is absolutely the best book for the beginning roboticist. The author starts at the very beginning (what do resistors look like when you first get them from the store?), explains how to build a robot in wonderful detail (exactly how to solder, precisely what to look for in a multimeter), and makes it great fun with his obvious enthusiasm, the sense of accomplishment that you get when you understand something new, and his quiet humor.

In this book, the author has you build a specific small, wheeled robot called Sandwich. And you can absolutely follow him through every, careful, interesting step to build this exact robot. But in some sense, the specifics of Sandwich don't really matter. Perhaps you want to build a combat robot, an animatronic figure, or a soccer-playing RoboCup contestant. Every basic skill that the author shows you in this book is enormously useful in building any other kind of robot: making a robot base, choosing and mounting motors, designing a circuit, wiring up LEDs. You have to start somewhere, and this is the place to start. He tells you exactly what parts to look for, and where to get them. And he explains EVERYTHING, so that by the time you put the book down, you really KNOW things.

I have seen many other amateur robotics books. Every other book I have read (again, except for the sequel to this book) skips over big details, over gives a broad scattershot overview, or points you in the right direction but leaves the specifics to the reader. Those other books have their uses, once you already have an idea of what building robots is all about. But this book gives you those very important first steps. And it's not the least bit overwhelming.

I can't recommend this book enough. It's a tour de force!",4

When I ordered this book I wasn't too sure about what I was going to get but I did know that the author's web site [...] is a robot builders paradise, so what the heck. What a great book!!!!! This book covers so much material based on early electronic theory, concepts, components, and breadboard configurations that you feel like you are sitting in an electronics class just soaking it all up! His text is broken into major sections covering electronic basics, equipment you will need to use, then he talks about the major components that will be used in the sandwich project ""A line following robot"". He lets you build each section of the robot in modules on an electric breadboard, which is great because you can see the circuit work, plus learn how the circuit functions, and make modifications to the circuit while not having to solder or unsolder components. He steps you through each section of the line following robot building each modules in order till you have the whole robot circuitry on the breadboard for testing. Later he shows you have to make the final robot product and put everything together soldered on a single circuit board. There is truly so much information here that the readers get way more than he pays for. It is easy to understand and humorous at the same time. He even covers calculations concerning voltage drops, load drops within the circuit, and power consumption. By the end of this book you will have completed the building of a real, authentic line following robot and have the knowledge to go onto bigger and better robot projects.

A little background: I have a college degree in science- health science. My electronics education is pretty much limited to the Physical Science I took in 9th grade- and I remember my Dad helping me struggle through that! However, I have two sons who are interested in learning robotics. There were no classes or organizations nearby, so we decided to start our own group so the boys could learn with a group of friends. Needless to say, I had to teach it! Over the past year, I've tried several different books/curriculum- including Lego Mindstorms material. I quickly got bogged down in each of these due to my limited background on the subject. I bought this book on a whim as a Christmas present for my oldest son, and was amazed the moment I opened it. After reading each chapter, I truly understand the concepts Mr. Cook is presenting. Our Robotics group decided to use this for our Spring ""semester"", and we are working through this a few chapters each week. The kids are really learning, and I even have a couple of kids as young as 10y/o who are reading the chapters and enjoying it! We decided to buy the kits that go with the books from Solarbotics to simplify things somewhat due to our group size, but we are loving it!

Very little knowledge is needed to get started. David takes you through small steps and explains everything piece by piece. I am looking forward to the advanced and arduino books.,1
Nick Cherney,5.0 out of 5 stars,Robot Building for Beginners,I just built my first robot!!!,"I'm an Electrical Engineer at U.C. I bought this book so I could learn some ""real world knowledge"" about the physical world instead of just theory. I only asked for (and thankfully received) a multimeter, soldering iron, and a cordless dremel drill for Christmas. After reading this book, I now remember why I chose my major--making a robot is a blast!
Being strong on the theory, I didn't learn anything in that regard. On the flip side, David Cook described the basics in a way that anyone could understand. What I really wanted to learn was to be able to put my Christmas presents to use. He spent a chapter just on the multimeter! I loved it. Also, every part of the robot was described in detail. I now know the difference between choosing motors, batteries, transistors, comparitors, diodes, potentiometers, photo-resistors, ect.
When I brought my first creation into my Electromagnetics class yesterday, I of course was asked to give a demonstration. From reading this book (to be honest a total of 3 times), I described everything about it in clear/consise detail. The only part I failed was receiving extra credit. Yes I did try :D.
I couldn't imagine a better book for beginners. There is a website that describes the robot AND the few typos caught (nothing that mattered), ways he took this idea and added a couple more in a similar project, as well as detailing the post construction of robots he's made since then. Cook goes into detail for troubleshooting a potential screw up you may make (If 'X' is happening then you probably did 'Y'). Yes I made one too--thanks for asking.
There is one part I didn't like about the project though--using an M&M's Mini tube to hold the motors. Being so close to Valentine's day, the only selection they had were PINK ones! Oh well, I named in Valentino anyway. I did find myself telling this story though to everyone that commented on my pink robot.
If you want to get into the hobby, buy this book. You can't ask for more. Just be prepared to catch yourself looking in the toy section of Target for lego technic tires when your fiance is wanting to register!!! BTW: you'll also catch yourself babbling on about your experiences in a review about this book too--cause you'll be so D@MN excited about making your first robot!!!",109

Aaron Peaster,5.0 out of 5 stars,Robot Building for Beginners,Great Book,This is one great book. I have enjoyed reading it I'm 14 and it is great for starting in the robotics. I have some knowledge in the electronics line so it had some stuff in it that I know. But nothing wrong in reading it again. This is a easy to understand book with lots of pictures of his stuff. One thing that I really like is that he has a section of it that he writes about his own mistakes. Great book!,1
W. Mackenzie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Robot Building for Beginners,Excellent Practical Advice,"I went to school for Electrical Engineer. Unfortunately, most of the education is theoretical and made for cubical dwellers. This book is a perfect companion for those wanting to get their hands dirty; which comes in handy if one's technician assistant takes the day off. I also found this to be a great book to share with my 10 year old. I would not expect kids to enjoy reading it; however, it helped explain the details in ways he would understand as we built the robot.",1

I mean u buy a kit, assemble it, learn next to nothing, and then the robot just does one thing and u quickly tire of it. These 2 books (especially the 2nd one) turn robotics into an open-ended hobby and a continuous source of education and experimentation. With kits, they do nothing until you are done and then only do one thing. But the way David Cook presents it, you learn all the time, you test little pieces and watch and learn how the parts work and how to make changes in the design. These 2 books are the best robotics books I have ever bought!",15

Tim Koren,2.0 out of 5 stars,Robot Building for Beginners,The book is focused on a project which requires a robotics kit that is no longer available,"While the book seems to be thorough and well-written, the majority of it is written with a robotics project (The ""Sandwich Robot"") in mind. If you bought the book in 2010 or 2011, it seems that you would have been able to purchase the $50 kit from [...] follow along in the book but the kit is sold out now. I've attempted to contact the author (David Cook) to inquire about future availability but have not received a response, so I'm going to assume that the kit will not be made available again in the future. It's a little disappointing that he cares so little about supporting his books that he will not even send a quick email to confirm that the kit will no longer be made/offered.

I think the book would have rated fairly high if the required equipment was available, but the lack of it forces me to drop the rating to a 2.",53

It is very good at a lot of the mechanical and electrical details, and How-To. But for Arduino/Microcontroller 'brains' you need to also buy his follow-on book INTERMEDIATE ROBOT BUILDING.

I was excited and I planned on building a robot while I read the book. But that isn't possible unfortunately. I do understand the need to describe the parts in detail along the way for beginners. However, it keeps those of us who learn by doing from learning. I don't know what parts to purchase until I get to that chapter. That means I'm either constantly stopping to run to the store, ordering a million things online separately and waiting for them to arrive, or not getting the parts and not working along with the book. I don't require a kit, but a simple list in the beginning of the book with small detail would have been much appreciated. Unfortunately, I ended up loosing interest and shelved the book.",2

Jie Zhou,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Biometrics,Great Book on Biometric Recognition,"Biometrics has been a very active research area over the past 10 years. The number of biometric deployments has increased rapidly throughout the world. However, it has been very difficult for universities to offer biometric courses for undergraduate students. Lack of a good textbook is one of the major causes. Introduction to Biometrics by Jain, Ross and Nandakumar will be indispensable for training a generation of young engineers and researchers. An excellent textbook will also significantly help instructors prepare their courses.

The authors have done a great job in balancing topics. More important biometric traits (fingerprint, face, and iris) are treated in detail, while other biometric traits are discussed briefly. The authors are also very careful in balancing subtopics. Take fingerprint recognition as an example. There exist several different methods for fingerprint representation and matching. Instead of covering all such methods, the authors have chosen the one, which is not only the most popular, but also has broader applications in other biometric modalities and computer vision problems. This will make the book easy to understand and very useful for students with different backgrounds.

Although the book covers many technologies that are quite new, it is very accessible. Take the chapter on biometric security as an example. A lot of people, including biometrics user group and even biometric researchers simply do not understand the importance as well as the difficulty of securing biometric templates. Although there are a number of technical papers and some good review papers on this topic, they are not very easy to read. But Section 7.5.1.1 of this book does an excellent job by comparing security of passwords to security of biometric templates. Figure 7.12 is quite useful for understanding the importance of securing biometric templates.

For the above reasons, I believe this book will surely become a classic in biometrics and will play a very important role in speeding up the development of biometric technology in the world. I have recommended this book for all the undergraduate and graduate students in my lab. I also strongly recommend this book to every biometric researcher and student. I definitely feel that this book has the best material to benefit people working in different areas of biometrics either in academia or industry. I have also planned to translate this book into Chinese so that Chinese researchers and students who have difficulty in understanding English can benefit from this excellent book.

This book is definitely the best book to learn biometrics at this point of time.",1
Annie,5.0 out of 5 stars,COMPUTER-AIDED TRANSLATION TECHNOLOGY: A Practical Introduction (Didactics of Translation),Excellent overview,"Excellent overview of computer-aided translation technology, with an enfasis on translation memories.

As it is an academic book, you should not expect anything very technical in IT. It is just a presentation of different technologies.",1
William Meyers,5.0 out of 5 stars,Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference (Representation and Reasoning),"Tough, but insightful","I purchased this book because of my interest in artificial intelligence. It is the classic on probabilistic reasoning. It was a tough read for me, likely because I had forgotten much of what I knew about probability, and tend to think in terms of Newtonian cause and effect. Also it was not directly related to neural network models, which is my key AI interest. Anyway, I never finished it. But it helped me prepare mentally for an online course in AI I completed successfully.

This and other works on probability really helped me in picking stocks to invest in, especially biotechnology stocks. I think about many things in a consciously probabilistic way now. I can see why some Romans worshipped Fortuna. There is causation, but a lot of outcomes are probabilistic.

This book is really about reasoning, and there is not that much higher math in it. It is the complexity of the reasoning that gave me pause. If you have never studied Bayesian logic, and want to predict the future, he covers this in Chapter 2, which alone made the book worthwhile for me.",3
John Hofmann,3.0 out of 5 stars,Intelligent Data Analysis,Good book for academic work,"I'm sure this book is very helpful for academics who are doing work or research into sophisticated ways of extracting knowledge from data, but if this is something you are looking to do for a practical or professional reason, this book probably isn't for you. It's very detailed with in-depth mathematical explanations for everything, although they are not helpful in actually implementing any of these types of algorithms. The book is also basically an index into publications and other works, so it's not really self-contained and I don't think it should be considered a standalone work.

It's got very interesting, well-researched material from very knowledgeable academics, and it seems like that's also the target audience. That's not bad, but it wasn't clear when I bought this book. If you're like me, and you're looking for practical explanations of these concepts, you may want to consider looking elsewhere.

I assume it's very useful for pure researchers, although I'm not one of those people so I have no insight into their needs. I hope this review helps give an idea of the contents.",15

Abbie Brown,4.0 out of 5 stars,Robots for Kids: Exploring New Technologies for Learning (Interactive Technologies),A good overview of the current state of the art,"This is a very decent collection of individually authored chapters from various groups of educators and engineers working in the field of robotics for teaching and for play. Most of the information presented is anecdotal and case-study, giving what seems to be a good overview of the current state of the art (particularly the state of the art in schools). Some of the reference sections at the end of the chapters point to very good articles that help ground one in the theory of techno-literacy.",4
Engineer Always Learning,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Probabilistic Theory of Pattern Recognition (Stochastic Modelling and Applied Probability),"Everything's here, but it requires work to fully understand","My advisor calls this ""the big yellow book"" of pattern recognition. This book is comprehensive, unabashedly theoretical, and requires a solid foundation in (preferably measure-theoretic) probability. But with that background, what a feast this book represents! A complete proof of Stone's universal consistency for the nearest neighbor rule? Check, it's here. Bounds on classification error, both the Bayes' error and empirical error? Check, it's here. Error rate estimation techniques? Check, it's here. Arbitrarily slow convergence of a classification rule? Check, it's here. I could keep going, but the answer to whether most topics of theoretical interest are covered would be the same.

The book admits in the preface that ""some of the material may be a bit dry"", but it is certainly worth the effort. You can't throw a stone very far in the pattern recognition / classification literature and not hit a paper by Devroye or one of his coauthors. The writing style is spare and sometimes they say volumes in a single sentence. Furthermore, the book is not intended to be read in a linear fashion. There is a great map for reading the various chapters (> 30) and how they are interrelated, which chapters need to be read before reading a subsequent chapter.

I can't speak highly enough about this book. It's not an easy read, but it is worth any effort you are willing to put in to learn and understand the theory of pattern recognition. This book will not teach you how to build or tune a classifier, but rather how to understand the theoretical factors that one should consider when doing so.",3
Math Enthusiast,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Probabilistic Theory of Pattern Recognition (Stochastic Modelling and Applied Probability),Best Available Book on Nonparametric Pattern Recognition,"I have taught Pattern Recognition for several years now, and my battered copy of DGL has been a loyal companion. I do not want to duplicate the previous reviews, but simply to add that this is a book on *nonparametric*, distribution-free methods in Pattern Recognition, the best one available by far on these methods. The authors clearly indicate all the strengths (e.g., universal consistency) and limitations (e.g., arbitrary slow convergence of universally consistent rules, Thm 7.2) of nonparametric methods. However, the authors entirely ignore (intentionally, no doubt) the considerable and distinguished body of literature on *parametric* pattern recognition techniques. For example, you will search in vain here for Linear Discriminant Analysis, or the work of very well-known names such as Anderson, Bowker, Sitgreaves, Raudys, McLachlan, etc. I do not feel that this is a ""flaw"" of the book, so that I still give it five stars. The book is already voluminous as is, and the authors made a choice on the material, to reflect their own interests and research backgrounds. But they selected a title for the book that may be misleading: this is not a book on all of Pattern Recognition, only on nonparametric, distribution-free methodology in Pattern Recognition. With that said, this is required reading for anyone seriously interested in the Pattern Recognition area.",1
R. Langari,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Computer and the Brain: Second Edition (Mrs. Hepsa Ely Silliman Memorial Lectures),Great book minus the preface by the Churchlands,"I could not locate my old copy of von Neumann's book so ordered a new one. The book, if a bit dated in its outlook, is still a fascinating intro to AI. What I can't figure out is why the Churchlands were asked to write a preface to the book, I wish they had at least done their homework or just checked their facts; mistaking William Church (a relative unknown in spite of a patent on typesetting machine dating back to early 1800's) for Alonzo Church, a towering figure in the foundations of computing is plain unacceptable.

I wish I had read this before I started my cognitive science education or before I have written my cog. sci. thesis.

A. Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unity Animation Essentials,Great explanation of Unity animator and animations for beginner and intermediate Unity developers,"I am fairly new to Unity (full time for just a few months) but have decided to make a personal goal of learning as much as I can over the next few months to see its potential. I have been working on a 2D game for a friend's company, and often got confused as to what capabilities Unity offered for 2D versus 3D in regards to animations. I have gone through many online articles and videos but still had some questions unresolved. I ordered this book since it focused solely on this topic, in hopes that it would clear up some of the confusion.

The author has a very easy to read writing style. IN fact, I read through the entire book the same day I got it. I had already learned a lot of the material through my own research, but the book did clarify many things and presented some things I didn't know. I was very pleased to see the section near the end on blend trees which was another source of confusion for me until now.

Having over 20 years of IT experience, I am fairly good at judging technical books. I believe this book is ideal for beginner to intermediate Unity programmers who want to better understand how animations work in Unity. The writer's style seems to fit those readers in particular. I am currently in the middle of another book by same author (Mastering Unity Scripting) which appears to be even better. I will write a review on that one soon.",1

Michael,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mahout in Action,very thorough explanations,"I am brand new to learning algorithms, so I was worried about trying to read this book. First I tried reading some documentation on the Mahout website, but I felt like I was getting a run-around treatment there. Their website kept providing links to documentation that required already knowing how these learning algorithms worked. Eventually I gave this book a try.

I was delightfully surprised, this book covers a lot of the learning algorithms in thorough detail. It is great for people with no prior knowledge of how machine learning works, like I was. If you already understand some things about machine learning, you will probably get bored fast.

I did have a few gripes though:

I felt like the clustering chapters did a great job explaining the k-means algorithm, but just did a little hand-waving for the more advanced algorithms. For example, the explanation of the canopy algorithm did not make sense to me after reading it twice, and I feel like the Latent Dirichlet Analysis algorithm made no sense at all. I learned what these algorithms were good for, but still don't completely understand how they work under the hood. Perhaps they are just too complicated to explain in the book, maybe they belong in an appendix, I don't know.

I'm reading the Classification chapters now, and I must admit that it's a bit verbose. The authors are repeating themselves way too much in chapter 13. I think multiple authors contributed to chapter 13 without looking at each-other's work. On the plus side I feel like I understand it.

I have not tried doing anything yet, some other reviewer's said the examples are out of date. I have come to expect that now with hadoop books, the libraries are evolving fast and unfortunately hadoop is awful at keeping things backwards compatible. I expect to have to ""interpret"" the examples when I go and try them.

My only other wish is that the author's gave you a little more advice regarding maven dependencies, and imports. I would like to see the fully qualified class name of some of the imports in the examples. The maven section should stress the importance of using the same jar that is installed on your machine, you may need to add the dependency on the CDH version of mahout, or the plain version of mahout. It would be nice if they showed you an example pom.

I'm giving this four stars because the explanations of the machine learning algorithms are pretty good. I will try revising this when I have done more.

==========================
After having tried a little more, here are my gripes:
1. The book is a little too text-oriented, meaning it focuses so much on how to cluster and classify text documents, that it doesn't give you enough advice on how to work with data that is not text documents.
2. It offers no useful advice on how to normalize input data that is not a text document.
3. Sometimes it tells you how to do something using the command line, but doesn't tell you how to do it in code.
4. It doesn't explain how to make your own cluster input files. It explains the canopy method, a method to do that on the command line (assuming text documents), but never shows you how to just create that file in code. Like if I want the clusters to start at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1), the book doesn't explain how to make that sequence file, I had to figure it out on my own.",2
Andrew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mahout in Action,I picked Mahout in Action back up and started reading again - and it was like Sean Owen could read my mind,"I purchased this book while preparing for a Mahout recommender system implementation for a customer, read it a little bit, and then set it down to start work.

Once I'd begun working, I started running into all kinds of questions about anonymous users, content-based recommendations, DataModel formats, and all kinds of other stuff. I looked and looked around online and had trouble finding concise answers to my questions.

I picked Mahout in Action back up and started reading again - and it was like Sean Owen could read my mind. I've never before purchased a computer science book that answered so many practical questions that were so hard to find online. So many small sections provide really great answers to specific problems that arise while using Mahout, and the index is great for finding those sections quickly. The code examples were perfect for jump-starting my code base.

Today I finished my initial prototype and everything is working exactly how I envisioned it when I first set out to build the recommender system. Would not have happened without this book.",1
Sujit Pal,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mahout in Action,"Slightly dated, but still useful","Apache Mahout is a very active, very useful and very successful open-source project whose focus is to provide machine learning algorithms on top of Hadoop. Because of the activity, however, this book is doomed to appear dated by the time you read it. The book can be useful if you are looking to get an overview of whats available in Mahout and general guidelines on how to use it. Since the project's focus is on providing ready-to-run implementations that can be run from a command line, the book can also be useful for the ""under the hood"" information it provides about how to use Mahout as an API, ie, use the components as building blocks for your own ready-to-run big data ML application. However, I found (quite drastic at times) differences between the book version (0.6) and what I was using (0.7), both for script parameters as well as Java API. So be prepared to read the project wiki (for the script parameters) and the source code (for using as an API).",4

Mahout in Action is written and explained so well with simple real life explanations and definitely executable code that you can gather all the techniques you've heard/read about come right near your grasp. Just extend your arms and reach for that recommender or clusterer.

Kevin M Lanaghan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Mahout in Action,"Poorly written : Unless you have some knowledge of clustering, this book won't be useful","There's a very incomplete and incoherent feel to the clustering section of this book. Mahout as a command line program vs mahout as a library of routines. A bit of theory thrown in here and there.

First the book use 0.5 of mahout while version 0.7 is the current release. Much of the code no longer works from the examples. Keeping the example code updated on the site would be a huge plus.

A useful start would have been discussing theory in chapter 7. Instead the theory is discussed in chapter 9.
Chatper 7 is a mishmash of distance measures, similarity and examples.

A thorough explanation of the output produced by clusterdumper would have been useful. With some knowledge of the algorithm you can figure out what c and r are and the numbers assigned to the vectors are. But taking a simple example and showing the actually hand calculation would be very useful to someone totaly new to clustering .

First, the notation is sometimes non-standard, e.g. the r vector is used to denote the label vector and superscripts are used sometimes as subscripts. Second, the explanations are sometimes too brief. For example, when deriving the solution for Least Squares Regression with Quadratic Discriminants, Vandermode matrices are used but the author fails to identify them as such, or to explain why they are useful.

Compared to 'Pattern Classification by Duda, Hart, and Stork', this book has a good balance between providing equations and explaining the idea behind the method. One thing that I like is that the author usually derives the equations. For example, I used the book to implement Hidden Markov Models algorithm in Java for classification. Especially, if you need a good source to learn Support Vector Machines, 'Chapter 10 Linear Discrimination' and 'Chapter 13 Kernel Machines' are the best of their kinds in the Machine Learning literature. Furthermore, examples shown in the figures are unique and very helpful to understand the topic. The author covers some methods that you usually see in the papers but not in the textbooks. Therefore, the book is also a good survey of Machine Learning techniques. In a nutshell, a great resource for those who want to use Machine Learning Algorithms for classification or regression as a tool and for those who want to implement Machine Learning Algorithms in their applications.",11

It's a great and inspiring read. Written by someone with actual practical experience creating sophisticated AI software and robots, the details mentioned in here really demonstrate depth of knowledge.

It's highly readable though, requiring no technical knowledge, and one of those titles (like Dawkins' Selfish Gene) that makes the reader feel like a genius as the layers unfold. It focuses on the details of making a single individual as sophisticated as possible rather than the approach taken by most comparable researchers, who hook together 'creatures' driven by a few simple rules, apply those to a large population and let 'emergent' processes do the rest and generate complex outcomes. It's true - looking at ants in the real world, and various a-life programs created, you do indeed get interesting and unforeseen complexities from a large population of super simple organisms. But every increase in the sophistication of the individual creatures will have exponential benefits in how rich the outcomes will be from a population of them!

He has challenged traditional thought on the subject of AI and in a way that has made converts out of many.

However, he spends 10 chapters saying ""you are all wrong - this is the way to do it"" - then doesn't follow up on doing it himself but rather takes enough shortcuts to make the work suspect - but to his credit he does say he's doing going just that :) All in all - if you're a software engineer or software developer I highly recommended the book.",8

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Learning Theory,An excellent overview,"The field of statistical learning theory has not only seen considerable advances in the last fifteen years, it has also found many applications, some of these appearing in commercial packages. It is now classified as a subfield of artificial intelligence, and as such gives an alternative, and frequently more general viewpoint on such topics as pattern recognition, regression estimation, and signal processing. The author of this book is one of the originators of statistical learning theory, and has written a book that will give the mathematically sophisticated reader a rigorous account of the subject. Most of the main results are proven in detail, but the author does find time to include insightful discussion on the origins and intuition behind the concepts involved in statistical learning theory.

Along with a brief introduction, the book consists of three parts, the first being an overview of the statistical theory of learning, the second giving the details of the now widely used support vector machines, and the last one (the most sophisticated mathematically) giving the statistical foundations of learning theory. In writing the book, the author wants to put forward a new approach to dependency estimation problems having their origin in learning theory, and being able to deal with the ?curse of dimensionality?. The origins of the subject lie in the pattern recognition problem and the Glivenko-Cantelli problem in statistics. Both of these problems were discovered to be essentially the same, and the author?s task is to use their similarities to construct a general theory of statistical inference and (inductive) learning. Indeed, a new induction principle, called ?structural risk minimization? (SRM) is paradigmatic in the book, along with the now ubiquitous VC dimension, the latter of which originates in the author?s early research. Both the SRM and the VC dimension illustrate the tension between the need for high accuracy and the need for the minimization of error in data sets.

The learning problem, as the author sees it, is the problem of selecting the correct dependence on the basis of empirical data. Two approaches to this problem are discussed, the first using a ?risk functional?, and the second involving the estimation of stochastic dependencies and the consequent solution of integral solutions. Both of these approaches are modeled in terms of a general model of learning from examples, which consists of a data generator, a supervisor, and a learning machine. The learning machine can either imitate the supervisor or identify how the supervisor operates. These two methods are different, the author says, in that the first one searches for the best prediction based on the data, while the second one attempts to approximate the operator representing the supervisor. Both approaches are studied in the book, with the first one being the easier of the two, while the second involving the solution of ill-posed problems. The author views the learning process in terms of choosing the right function from a given function collection.

Both perceptrons and their generalizations, neural networks, are briefly discussed in the book, along with the back-propagation method. The author gives reasons why he does not think neural networks are well-controlled learning machines, such as the existence of local minima, the slow convergence of the gradient method, and the choice of scaling factors. These problems serve as motivation for the introduction of support vector machines, which are introduced as optimal separating hyperplanes. Support vector machines take input vectors into a high-dimensional feature space via a nonlinear mapping, and an optimal separating hyperplane is then constructed in this feature space.

Similar to the need for neural networks to generalize well, separating hyperplanes must do the same, and due to the large dimensionality of the feature space, a hyperplane that separates the training data may not generalize well. In addition, the large dimensionality of the feature space makes the construction of the hyperplane computationally demanding. The author shows that optimal hyperplanes, found using various mathematical techniques such as quadratic optimization, do generalize well. Also, as the author points out, the explicit form of the feature space need not be known, since only the inner products between the ?support vectors? and the vectors of the feature space need to be calculated. The calculation of the inner product is done with the insight gained from Mercer?s theorem, which gives the existence of a kernel function such that there exists a feature space where this function generates the inner product. This inner product in feature space allows the construction of a decision function that is nonlinear in the input space but that is equivalent to a linear function in the feature space. Different choices of the kernel function give different types of learning machines. The author discusses three examples of support vector machines for pattern recognition: polynomial, radial basis function, and two-layer neural network support vector machines. An entire chapter is spent on the problem of digit recognition using support vector machines.",47

Haubrechts Patrick,3.0 out of 5 stars,Spies in the Sky: Surveillance Satellites in War and Peace (Springer Praxis Books),Not as thorough as expected,"Spies in the Sky, Surveillance Satellites in War and Peace.

From the title, I expected a book covering all aspects of spying from space. Instead, the author focuses on the first generation Corona program, based on film return in re-entry capsules. This is normal, because he was working in this project. Still, very little is said about other kinds of surveillance satellites, such as the signal interception, electronic signature intelligence, missile detection, atomic explosion detection, submarines monitoring, etc. No description of the Echelon program, or the Vortex system, for example.

Since the book is not restricted on US satellites, little is said about Soviet counterparts, some about the Zenith, equivalent to the Corona, but not much more. There is not even one word about the Almaz soviet program, which is one of the few examples of human operating spying devices from space, except perhaps the space shuttle.

His style is more narrative than descriptive, making the reading very easy. The subject is well introduced, but some comparison tables would have helped to gather and compare data.

As a conclusion, if this book had been titled :

US spy satellites, the Corona Program, it would have been an excellent book.

BAYANG,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Optimization Methods: With Mathematica® Applications,My Optimisation Companion,"Practical Optimization Methods - M.Asghar Bhatti

This is my favorite optimisation book. I recommend it to anyone interested in the application of optimisation techniques, in particular for those in industry. This book has been a constant companion in my optimisation adventure and unlike other books; it has helped me firmly establish a solid foundation and understanding on the various optimisation techniques and the theories behind them. Believe me, I can even read those books which I have shelved in the past because they were complicated with too many cryptic mathematical statements. They don't scare me anymore.

Bhatti wisely used Mathematica as the teaching platform and the accompanying OptimizationToolbox software allows one to brush aside the cryptic mathematical statements. The reader can now concentrate on the concepts, relegating the mathematics manipulations to Mathematica and the functions of the OptimisationToolbox. What I like about this book is that it also shows how the Taylor Series, the Quadratic Form and convexity requirements are put into practice to create an iterative scheme to solve a system of non-linear equations. The OptimisationToolbox and the internal Mathematica functions seamlessly pace the reader through the mathematical preliminaries. By the end of Chapter 3, the reader should now be a good shape to go to the more serious stuffs.

Chapter 4 deals with the subject of optimality conditions starting first with the optimality conditions for unconstrained optimisation problems. These conditions, albeit slightly more involved in computation, are essentially the same as the optimality conditions for single variable functions of the high school days. The ""slightly involved"" computations are those of the Grad (1st Order and Necessary Condition) and the Hessian (2nd Order and Necessary). Mathematica graphics are put to great effect to help visualize the meaning of these conditions.

The additive property of constraints, which was dealt with in graphic detail, extends the earlier ideas behind the optimality conditions for an unconstrained optimisation to that for constrained optimisation problems.

The introduction to Chapter 5 gives an excellent overview of issues in solving unconstrained problems. Basically, all solution schemes covered in this chapter involve two steps. The first step is a simple iterative scheme, which requires a direction and a step length. The second step is a termination condition, taken as when the gradient of objective function, which should be zero at the optimal point, is sufficiently close to within a specified tolerance to zero.

The process of computing the step length in for a particular search direction is known as the line search. The line search methods (including Mathematica algorithms) covered include analytical line search, equal interval search, section search, the Golden Section search, the Quadratic Interpolation Method and the Approximate Line Search based on Armijo's rule.

As for the search direction, one obvious choice would be along the direction of greatest negative change - the Steepest Descent Method. The performance of this method can suffer badly as it zigzag search scheme slows down to a crawl as it approaches the optimal point. One improvement would be to retain some potion of the previous search direction, so the resultant search pattern is not successively perpendicular to each other but somewhere in between. This approach of adding some potion of the previous direction is known as the Conjugate Gradient Method. The two ""some previous direction potion"" schemes covered and included as Mathematica functions are the Fletcher-Reeves and the Polak-Ribiere schemes. Other numerical methods covered include the Modified Newton and the Quais-Newton Methods. One drawback of latter approach is the computation of the Hessian Matrix at each iteration step. The Quasi-Newton Methods do not require the computation of the Hessian Matrix. Instead they use some inverse Hessian update methods. Two such methods covered are the DFP (Davidon, Fletcher, and Powel) Update and the BFGS (Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shannon) Update. Don't be intimidated by all these jargons, Mathematica functions including graphic functions are provided to provide a step-by-step explanation and presentations of the various concepts are provided.

The section on Linear Programming is extensive, in comparison to other chapters. I was tempted to skim over this LP section because the technique is well known and there are many industry standard LP algorithms on the market so why spend too much time on it. However, my curiosity got the better of me and I must confess that the combination of the accompanying OptimisationToolbox and Mathematica Graphics makes the revision on Linear Programming entertaining and interesting. The section started with an overview of issues involved in solving an underdetermined system of linear equations; going over the Gauss-Jordan, LU decomposition and introduction of slack variables to convert the LP problem into its standard form. The simplex algorithm is introduced in three styles: Simplex Tableau, Basic Simplex and Revised Simplex. The first two simplex styles, as Mathematica functions by the way, are intended to show the sequence of steps of the simplex algorithm. For large problems, however, the above LP methods may take a long time and researchers have developed better search methods such as the interior point method. The interior point method, as its name implies, starts from an interior feasible point and takes appropriate steps alone descent directions towards the optimal point.

Chapters 8 & 9 adequately covered the subject of quadratic programming and constrained nonlinear problems. However, they concentrated only on local optimisation techniques. Inclusion of global optimisation methods such as Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithms (GA), Discrete Gradient Methods (DGM), Hooke-Jeeves, Nelder and Mead, and Powell methods would have made the book a complete guide to practical optimisation.

Ravindra Arya,3.0 out of 5 stars,Basics of MATLAB and Beyond,Good introductory text with some gaps,"I am a neurologist and not an engineer. I made a hesitant first introduction with MATLAB when I ventured into studying some event related spectral power changes. I wanted a DIY manual- which will enable me to play with MATLAB and learn in the process. This is a good book- assumes no prior knowledge, has clarity and manageable volume. However, there are some gaps. For someone from non-mathematical background, a brief chapter on linear algebra (slightly more than few sections in chapter 1) or even suggesting some resource to go to before venturing into MATLAB, would have been appreciable. Perhaps the biggest drawback of this book is that it has lot of gaps between chapters and lacks a smooth flow. Majority of latter chapters use concepts that are not given in earlier ones, rather a lot of knowledge is presumed (e.g. chapter on TFA could have done with some introduction to signals and systems). Perhaps, engineers will have that material from other parallel courses. All in all, a good but insufficient introductory book.

Let's Compare Options Preptorial,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curves and Surfaces for Computer Graphics,2013 Update-- Great Mathematica Book,"We just received the hard/paperback conversion revision after a LONG wait, and I've used many previous versions over the past 6 years. The website is still outstanding, and the Mathematica code runs flawlessly. In fact, this fine text could equally be applied to teaching/ learning Mathematica graphics as teaching the math of computer surfaces.

Some reviews across the web mention that this is ""out of date"" because it doesn't cover Blender, Maya, etc. BUT if you look at the Ada or Python or Maple (or yes Mathematica) ""beneath"" rendering programs, you'll find the SAME math that is detailed in much simpler form here-- because most of it goes back to ~ the 1800s! Given the intent, it would be tough to be out of date in that frame.

The authors say that only basic calculus is needed, but they do get into partial derivatives, double sums and other more intimidating projective geometry, but take the time to explain for those who don't have a lot of linear algebra or analytic geometry. The really cool thing is that every technique is given MANY alternative solution sets and real life tips, from trig to numeric to mathematica to ""tricks"" like simulating rotation matrices for rotation surfaces with iterated cubic polynomials instead of more difficult trig functions.

The drag and drop crowd will NOT like this text because it's all math. But if you want to see what's going on underneath the script, and are willing to brush up on Mathematica, this treatment is well worth your time. It was written for early undergrads, or autodidacts with advanced algebra and a little calculus, so is quite unique in starting at the basic level, yet getting ALL today's major CG topics and math methods covered (Points, vectors, Cartesians, torsion, patches, transforms, lofting, numerous surface models, Hermite, splines, Beziers, subdivisions, sweeps, conics, etc.). There are many other ""math for graphics"" or ""math for gaming"" books, but they are mostly at high undergrad or advanced grad levels. This is one of the rare few that takes the time to explain it on many levels and with many examples.

The last reprint took 8 months to become available again. Due to its uniqueness, I'm betting this will become a classic and hit the $250+ price levels as it becomes harder to get. Great investment for reference, your library, and the multi angled pedagogic approach.

The author defifitely knows his stuff. This book delves deeply into the nuts and bolts of color management and it is definitely not for beginners (who should buy ""Color Management for Dummies""). This book not only teaches the principals of color management, but explains why it is necessary. It is not tied to any specific software or hardware, although an occasional reference is made to Photoshop and reference is also made to the various hardware used to calibrate your equipment. It is very heavy on theory and if you are technically enough inclined, you will be well on the way to becoming expert in color management. This appears to be one of the definitive works of color management and it rightly deserves the great reviews it gets.",6
Todd Ebert,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Evolutionary Algorithms in Theory and Practice: Evolution Strategies, Evolutionary Programming, Genetic Algorithms",scholarly and from a general viewpoint,"In comparing this book with, say Goldberg's ""Genetic Algorithms..."" (may be the most popular genetic algorithms text), this book reads more like a German habilitation thesis (which I imagine it may have served as such), where as Goldberg's book seems more of a light introduction for the mathematically uninitiated. Indeed, Back's book seems quite scholarly with lots of useful references, and gives a good introduction to not only genetic algorithms, but also to evolutionary strategies (a paradigm that is most applicable to Euclidean-type search spaces) and evolutionary programming

(simular to ES and not to be confused with genetic programming).

I found Chapters 1 and 2 quite good, in that Chapter 1 presented the biological motivations for evolutionary computing along with a brief introduction to the theory of computation and computational complexity, while Chapter 2 gave a very good introduction to the above-mentioned evolutionary computing paradigms. The remainder of the book reads more like a report on the author's experiments in evolutionary computing.

It is important to note that Goldberg's book does not cover Evolutionary Strategies, which I have found to be a more fruitful approach since it is specifically designed for Euclidean space where many if not most interesting optimization problems are formulated in.

Finally, I offer bit of advice for those who plan to read through this book. Some of the definitions are stated with such generality that they seem very opaque upon first reading. It is very important to understand them, so do not give up! Once the defintions are understood, the algorithms will seem much easier to comprehend. In fact, the algorithms have a very simple outline:

i) initialize population

ii) while the terminating condition is not yet met: recombine to form new population members, mutate the population members, select the most fit population members to form the next generation.

The partial analyses provided for the algorithms can be skipped on first reading.",9

M. Forr,4.0 out of 5 stars,Designing Mobile Interfaces: Patterns for Interaction Design,Must read for people designing interfaces for mobile devices.,"tl;dr This is a must buy if you're an interface designer for mobile because it's a well researched, structured and thorough reference to interaction/interface design best practices.

In the same vein as Jenifer Tidwell's Designing Interfaces book Designing Mobile Interfaces is a full color collection of 76 interface design best practices used in mobile devices. What makes this book unique is that the authors have canvassed not only advanced phones but also GPS units, PDAs, handheld game consoles and various other small devices with a screen and then made sure they had research or evidence to support the each best practice. As such this book is extremely thorough, researched and structured.

Each best practice pattern is broken into a 'Problem', 'Solution', 'Variations', 'Details' and 'Anti-pattern'. I really appreciate the structure of each but I have to say the images while abstracted and clear are kind of hokey due to the black, yellow and red color scheme. More than anything though I've really enjoyed the Antipatterns because they do a good job of contrasting the best practice with well the not best practice.

For instance, the Notifications design pattern. In it they state that if there are multiple ones they should be displayed all together (not serially) and shouldn't interrupt the users workflow. Once I read the best practice I could clearly see why the notifications in Apples iOS 5 make so much sense and why the previous notifications were flawed. That was the section that really validated that these guy know what they're talking about.

So far I've read through the first two sections of the book (I. Pages & II. Components) and I have to say that it is worth it. On the other hand, it has been a bore which is why I took one star off. They start the book with the vary basics 'Pages' and 'Titled' which led me to skip some pages but overall the information in is book has been very rich.

Who is this book for?
If you are responsible for the interface or information architecture of a mobile device or app then this book is a must read. I've been designing interfaces for mobile devices for the past two and a half years and this book has helped to expand my vocabulary and articulate why I make the decisions I make.

How to use this book?
I hate to admit it but trying to read this from cover to cover is going a slog but it will serve as a good reference when brainstorming new interfaces.",8

VA,1.0 out of 5 stars,Designing Mobile Interfaces: Patterns for Interaction Design,"Punishingly boring, a giant porridge of thought","The goal is valuable: speak about how to design mobile interfaces well. The execution is poor, to say the least. I ended up leafing through it at a high speed, and was still left with a throbbing headache.

The good:
1. Lots of devices surveyed.
2. Ideas carefully organized into chapters and with excellent screenshots (with a real color scheme!).

The bad:
1. Ideas themselves are really thrown into a big porridge of ideas. Do this. Do that. Do this. If you have a four way switch, do this. Some devices do this. Other devices do that. Do this. Do that.... And so on for hundreds of pages.
2. The writing itself is confusing. The beginning of the second chapter reads, ""Look around you. Are you inside?"" (Inside WHAT? A dog? Their minds?) I read that sentence five times before proceeding. After reading the next sentence I realized they meant ""Are you indoors?"" Big difference. The book is filled with confused writing. Perhaps poor editing, eh?
3. Much of the ideas themselves are too simple to merit the convoluted prose. Scrolling: shucks guys everyone knows what it is. Point out the valuable things and move on. You don't need to dedicate pages to the act of scrolling.

Craig Mehan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Android Game Development,"Great book, but you will work for it.","I am very torn with this book. On one hand it explains Android game development: creating a game engine, handling various game contollers, different techniques to draw to the screen, game object collision detection, particles, sound, menu's and animation. The author tries to step through each topic starting simple to more complex implementations. I really did learn a lot.

On the other hand, it was a slog all the way through. Ok calibration, my knowledge of Android is at an intermediate level; I have taken classes (for fun) at my community college on Java and Android (my degree is BSEE), I have written apps for myself but not placed them on Google Play. The book has source code that can be downloaded, it is divided by chapters, but only the code for the end of the chapter. As I said earlier, the chapters develop a concept from simple to more complex. The code from the beginning of a chapter is many times very different than at the end of the chapter. The chapter hits the high points of the code, but not all, so it is the students lesson to figure it out. The collision detection chapter was particularly grueling, with much of the code not listed in the book. I counted twenty errors in the book; many from where the code changed, but the book code listing had not changed.

Is this a bad book? No. I learned a lot, but it was as challenging as any upper level under graduate course that I have ever taken. I don't think it had to be that hard. Probably later editions of this book will improve as more detail is added.",3

Peter McCluskey,3.0 out of 5 stars,Made-Up Minds: A Constructivist Approach to Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Series),"It's odd to call a book boring when it uses the pun ""ontology recapitulates phylogeny""[1]","It's odd to call a book boring when it uses the pun ""ontology recapitulates phylogeny""[1]. to describe a surprising feature of its model. About 80% of the book is dull enough that I barely forced myself to read it, yet the occasional good idea persuaded me not to give up.

Drescher gives a detailed model of how Piaget-style learning in infants could enable them to learn complex concepts starting with minimal innate knowledge.

Drescher's model shows how a mind can start with only very low level concepts that correspond to momentary interactions of a single sense with an object (e.g. move hand left, or object seen at the upper left of the visual field), and build from that an understanding of object permanence and an awareness of how input from different senses can refer to a single object.

Drescher's model makes a clear prediction for Molyneux's Problem which has since been proven correct, but which may have been moderately controversial at the time.

It seems highly appropriate for some AI research to focus on problems that 1-week old humans find challenging but possible, in order to focus on building increasingly general-purpose models of the world.

I expect his model provides hints at how powerful AIs will develop, but I expect his system is not efficient or flexible enough to have much direct influence on AI research. So this book is a good deal less important than his other book, Good and Real.

Alas, large parts of this book appear designed mainly to get Drescher's PhD thesis accepted: they're detailed descriptions of how he implemented the model. The benefits of those details could have been better achieved by putting the source code on the web, but the book was published before the web was popular enough for that.

Henry,5.0 out of 5 stars,Made-Up Minds: A Constructivist Approach to Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Series),A significant advance in Artificial Intelligence,"This book describes a theory of how a computer program might be implemented to learn and use new concepts that have not been programmed into it. It uses the theories and observations of Jean Piaget, theories of learning in infants and children, as a basis on which to formulate a new vocabulary which allows us to talk in concrete terms about formerly vague and confusing concepts which are central to the understanding and engineering of intelligence.
The central proposition of the theory is the ""schema mechanism"", which describes an elegant and technically and philosophically satisfying mechanism for how a learning system can incorporate new and previously incomprehensible fragments of knowledge, to build new and robust descriptions of objects and the effects of actions upon them. These new ""schemas"" can be incorporated into yet more complex descriptions of the environment, providing a robust and self-consistent system that can bootstrap itself to higher and higher levels of competence and intelligence, without need for any external intervention from the programmer except in the form of ""teaching"" the system as you would a real human infant.

Michael R. Chernick,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Frailty Model (Statistics for Biology and Health),first serious book dedicated to Frailty Models,"The authors are academics who have done serious research in survival analysis and are very familiar with frailty models. The topic comes up when time to event data for one event is correlated with the time to event data for another or other events. This topic is sometimes referred to a subject in multivariate survival analysis or the analysis of clustered survival data.

As a professional biostatistician with a keen interest in survival models I have attended professional meetings in recent years and heard the term Frailty Model mentioned but I didn't know what it was. There of course is the natural connotation of weakness as in a feeble or frail person. But the actual formal dtatisticial meaning was a mystery. Other books that I am very familar with deal in part with frailty models but this is to my knowledge the first serious text dedicated to this topic. It also covers related methods to accomplish the same goal such as copulas (another term common in recent books and literature but one I was not familiar with either). For example Philip Hougaard wrote the first advanced text on multivariate survival models and covers parametric forms of frailty models. Klein and Moeschberger wrote a generaal survival analysis book that includes a chapter on semi-parameric fraility models. It showa how the EM algorithm is used to estimate parameters of the models. Ibrahim and colleague wrote a book on Bayesian methods in survival analysis and cover the Bayesian approach to both semi-parametric and parametric fraility models. Therneau and Grambsch wrote a recent book on the Cox proportional hazard model and its extensions. It included information on semi-parametric frailty models using the penalized partial likelihood approach to estimation.

This book is a well-written introduction to fraility models that includes all these methods provides real world examples and good explanations on how to interpret the results. The examples are illustrated using the freeware language R. This book could serve as either an undergraduate or graduate text in statistical methods and is a great reference for biostatisticians.",30

C4.5 (See5/C5) is a linear classifier system that is often used for machine learning, or as a data mining tool for discovering patterns in databases. The classifiers can be in the form of either decision trees or rule sets. Just like ID3 it employs a ""divide and conquer"" strategy and uses entropy (information content) to compute its gain ratio (the split criteria).

C5.0 and See5 are built on C4.5, which is open source and free. However, since C5.0 and See5 are commercial products the code and the internals of the See5/C5 algorithms are not public. This is why this book is still so valuable. The first half of the book explains how C4.5 works, and describes its features, for example, partitioning, pruning, and windowing in detail. The book also discusses how C4.5 should be used, and potential problems with over-fit and non-representative data. The second half of the book gives a complete listing of the source code; 8,800 lines of C-code.

C5.0 is faster and more accurate than C4.5 and has features like cross validation, variable misclassification costs, and boost, which are features that C4.5 does not have. However, since minor misuse of See5 could have cost our company tens of millions of dollars it was important that we knew as much as possible about what we were doing, which is why this book was so valuable.

The reasons we did not use, for example, neural networks were:
(1) We had a lot of nominal data (in addition to numeric data)
(2) We had unknown attributes
(3) Our data sets were typically not very large and still we had a lot of attributes
(4) Unlike neural networks, decision trees and rule sets are human readable, possible to comprehend, and can be modified manually if necessary.

It is still a bit ponderous in places but then it is the only book that covers the material in this much detail, truly a Bible of the field. It is a great graduate level text and a must-have book for any comm engineer. Charan Langton complextoreal.com",14

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach,The optimal learning algorithm for learning A.I.,"Progress in the field of artificial intelligence has executed a random walk after establishing itself with a bang in the 1950s. Optimistic predictions of the future of A.I. in that decade only partially came true in the decades after that. Currently, the field is divided up into subfields going by the names data mining, computational intelligence, intelligent agent theory, expert systems, etc. This book is the best book available for learning about this fascinating and important subject. The applications of A.I. are enormous, and will increase dramatically in the decades ahead. Indeed the prospects are very exciting, and the authors themselves have been involved heavily in extending the frontiers of the subject. Some of the main points of the book that really stand out include:
1. The useful exercises at the end of each chapter. 2. The discussion of simple reflex and goal-based agents. 3. The treatment of constraint satisfaction problems and heuristics for these kinds of problems. 4. The overview of iterative improvement algorithms, particularly the discussion of simulated annealing. 5. The discussion of propositional logic and its limitations as an effective A.I. paradigm. 6. The treatment of first-order logic and its use in modeling simple reflex agents, change, and its use in situation calculus. There is a good overview of inference in first-order logic in chapter 9 of the book, including completeness and resolution. 7. The treatment of logic programming systems; the Prolog language is discussed as a logical programming language. Noting that Prolog cannot specify constraints on values, the authors discuss constraint logic programming (CLP) as an alternative logic programming language that allows constraints. 8. The discussion of semantic networks and description logics. 9. The treatment of conditional programming via the conditional partial-order planner (CPOP). 10. Representing knowledge in an uncertain domain and the semantics and inference in belief networks. 11. The brief discussions on stochastic simulation methods and fuzzy logic. 12. The discussion on computational learning theory 13. The treatment of neural networks, especially the discussion of multilayer feed-forward networks and the comparison between belief networks and neural networks. 14. The brief discussion on genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming. 15. The discussion on explanation-based learning and the technique of memoization. 16. The (excellent) overview of inductive logic programming. This relatively recent area was new to me at the time of reading so I appreciated the discussion. The authors briefly mention the approach of discovery systems and the Automated Mathematician (AM). 17. The interesting discussion of telepathic communication between robots via the exchange of internal representations. 18. The discussion on a formal grammar for a subset of English and the extensive treatment of natural language processing. 19. The discussion of speech recognition and the use of hidden Markov models and the Viterbi algorithm. 20. The fascinating discussion on robotics, particularly the treatment of configuration spaces, which brings in some techniques from computational geometry and topology. 21. The discussion on the philosophical ramifications of A.I. Future developments in A.I. will provide a unique testing ground for philosophy, in a way that will be unparalleled in the history of philosophy. Philosophers critical of A.I. will have the opportunity to check whether their arguments against the possibility of ""strong A.I."", are in fact true.",78
William A. Barrett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Handbook of Fingerprint Recognition,Outstanding biometrics technical book,"As a teacher and part-time research professor in the field of biometrics, I can recommend this book to anyone interested in the technical aspects of digital fingerprint biometrics.
It is studded with references to the key papers in the field.
You will also find a chapter on security and spoofing issues, which reviews everything from gel methods for faking a fingerprint through coding, encryption and the possibility of intercepting code transmissions to a server.
The book comes with software on a CDROM, an artificial fingerprint generator. One of the chapters reviews this generator and discusses its performance relative to collections of real fingerprints -- in particular, it can be used to generate a large set of mutated prints of a ""same"" finger, something needed for an authentics distribution, that most biometric data sets lack.
Those interested in other biometrics (face, iris, hand shape, etc.) will find a brief discussion of these in the first chapter.

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Blondie24: Playing at the Edge of AI (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence),A very interesting and engaging story,"In this book the author gives a detailed story of his involvement in the development of the ""Blondie24"" checkers program, and the story is a very interesting one. The reader not familiar with certain research topics in artificial intelligence such as neural networks and evolutionary programming, will still be able to read the book since the author gives a good intuitive discussion of these topics. If the book inspires a young person to enter the field of artificial intelligence, it has served a noble purpose, even if the author did not intend this as the primary purpose of the book.
The author's main thesis is the value of using concepts of evolutionary programming to bring about the rise of intelligent machines. The author clearly believes that before ""HAL-like"" machines can be built, researchers must construct computer programs that can teach themselves how to solve problems without any help. Intelligent machines must be creative, and learn and adapt to new circumstances. Traditional research in artificial intelligence has been geared towards building machines that emulate human intelligence, and this will not do in the author's view. The research did not address the true definition and meaning of intelligence, but instead made the goal of creating machines that think and act like humans, whence the famous ""Turing test"" for machine intelligence. The author completely rejects this test and holds it responsible for bringing about the ""AI winter"" where no substantive progress was made. ""The key to creating truly creative computers"", he says, ""lies in mimicking nature's process of evolution.""
The author though was not comfortable with merely refuting arguments about the Turing test or other strategies for designing intelligent machines. He knows that such argument-counterargument activity will not result in sound approaches to artificial intelligence. Therefore, he sought to construct a working, viable alternative, which produces results that can be checked. Intelligence for the author is based on decision making, such as how to obtain resources, and how to respond to environmental changes by prioritizing goals. ""Intelligence is the property that allows living organisms to sense, react to, and learn from their environment in order to adapt their behavior to better promote their survival"", he says.
Hence, the author brings in the evolutionary paradigm to artificial intelligence, and to give credence to his view, he attempts to create a program that will learn the game of checkers and then play it well, at least from the standpoint of the checkers game rating system. The book is a very detailed overview of how he and his collaborators went about doing this, the most interesting strategy being the use of neural networks, the topology of which is not set beforehand, but is evolved according to a ""survival of the fittest"" process. The author, through diagrams, gives the reader a taste of the moves that were made as the program dealt with online checkers games.
The author even gives a dose of the criticism he received from referees when his results were submitted to professional journals, and this gives the book greater appeal from the standpoint of intellectual honesty. Certainly the author and those he worked with have achieved a great deal in the context of building intelligent machines. It remains to be seen whether evolutionary programming can be extended to situations that require even more creativity, such as that of generating new and interesting results in pure mathematics. This is the ultimate test in my view of machine intelligence. It is not immediately obvious how this is to be done in the evolutionary programming or indeed of any other paradigm in artificial intelligence.",19
Tom W. Brotherton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Blondie24: Playing at the Edge of AI (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence),A True Technology Adventure,"I started reading David Fogel's ""Blondie24: Playing at the Edge of AI"" on a recent flight more or less to better my professional knowledge. I also had a `fun' book. However, once I started reading Blondie24 I could not put it down. It is a true technology adventure that describes the development of an innovative program that teaches itself to play checkers. And it did this with no expert input or help. Rather it just plays a second version of itself. The two versions independently `evolve' to determine winning positions and strategies. As Fogel describes, in short order the program can easily beat its creator. And not long there after 99% of the people participating on a checkers playing website. That's amazing. And I do this sort of stuff for a living.
David Fogel is a world renowned expert and innovator in the development of evolutionary learning techniques described in Blondie24. His work is the state of the art, well known and respected by all in the field. The program and its implications are not only fascinating but extremely important and I believe a real look into the future for the development of `intelligent' systems.
I highly recommend Blondie24 to anyone even mildly interested in current AI technologies and the future of computing and intelligent systems. It's a great book.",10
Phillip T. Carson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Blondie24: Playing at the Edge of AI (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence),Most compelling AI book I've read,"I was already interested in neural networks, and have read several other books on the subject, all for information on how to design and build neural networks to do various tasks, so I was primed to like this book, but I had no idea how compelling it would be. Fogel does give most of the details necessary to recreate Blondie, but some of the specifics for the later modifications are missing and can be found, I believe, in his and his partner's scientific articles referenced in the book.
The first half is quite good, giving very basic background information on neural networks and machine learning algorithms as well as a brief history of the two best known checkers programs, Samuels' machine learning checkers player and Chinook, the best ever player (so far).
It's the second half of the book, however, that kicks the story into overdrive. Fogel begins describing how he and his partner, Kumar Chellapilla, made their design decisions, evolved a neural net, then began playing it against humans over the internet. Even if you aren't all that interested in checkers (I am not) the games as they are described by Fogel become at least as interesting as any close sporting event, especially in those cases where the neural net set up traps for its opponents that neither Fogel nor the other player could foresee. There were times that I couldn't stop reading. I'd get off the bus to work, get in the office, and continue until I could pull myself away. The second half of this book is as much a page turner as the best novels I've read.
An absolute must read for anyone interested in where AI needs to go.",32
Peter Andrews,5.0 out of 5 stars,Blondie24: Playing at the Edge of AI (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence),Well written and intelligent. AI as it should be.,"I once took an introductory AI course (Brown '84, Professor Eugene Charniak) and was immediately turned off when, during the first lecture, the professor said that we would not cover learning. To talk about intelligence without learning seemed misguided. Blondie24 shows the power of learning in an organic, evolutionary way.
David Fogel gives a broad overview of the origins of the main approaches in classical AI. He explains how many approaches fell into a seductive trap of top down planning. His own approach uses evolution as a powerful tool for learning. Learning from the experience of life on earth, he proves that selecting simply on whether his chess program wins, loses, or draws over multiple games is sufficient to allow considerable learning. This is a powerful lesson that should be applicable across any discipline -- not simply checkers.
David writes simply and clearly and with respect even for the AI pioneers whose approaches he disagrees with.
Blondie24 has inspired me to read more on this subject. It is thought provoking -- I now want to start doing my own experiments in evolutionary programming to explore the ideas further.
P.S. I found that ""Creation : Life and How to Make It"" by Steve Grand to be an excellent follow up read to Blondie24.",23
William Rockwell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Blondie24: Playing at the Edge of AI (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence),Great Stuff,"This book should probably appeal to almost anyone with an interest in artificial intelligence.
For the beginner this book offers a nice intuitive introduction to subject areas such as neural nets and genetic algorithms.
The expert is not likely to learn any technical matertial but will probably enjoy it as it is a wonderfully written story and perhaps some inspiration. If all you want is a technical manual, then you should look elsewhere.
My level of knowledge of AI is closer to a beginner than an expert. Here are three things that struck me:
1. How long it can take to evolve a good solution. One example from the book took 6 months using pentium 400.
2. How petty academics can be. The last section contains comments made by referees reviewing papers written by the author in scientific journals. Most of them smack of ""Damn why didn't I think of that. Well since I didn't, I will try to block someone who did"".
3. How elegant GA can be. This book has inspired me to seriously study the various techniques in evolutionary methods.
There are two minor annoyances I found in the book. They are both related to the layout of the book. The book is almost square and has relatively short sides. I assume this was done to make the book look like a checkerboard. This gives the book an odd ""feel"". Because of the dimentions, the amount of material on each page is relatively small and often the diagrams are not on the same page as the words describing them. However these are very minor complaints on what is a very fine book.",5

The book is written in a colloquial style, but manages to give both a good introduction to evolutionary artificial intelligence and computer game design -- science entertainment without the fluff! The first-hand view of the tension between scientific rigor and engineering excitement will be especially interesting to prospective young scientists (hint: rigor wins). I hope the publisher has an active campaign to market this book as a educational tool.

Blondie24 is the story of how real machine learning created an expert checkers playing program. Instead of the traditional method of hand-coding human expertise about a game, Fogel set out from the start to have his program learn to play checkers without any human coaching except for the basic rules of the game. Starting from nothing but randomness, different checker playing program candidates competed with each other in a ""survival of the fittest"" tournament, evolving better players over time. The end result was an expert-level checkers-player.
As Dr. Fogel eloquently points out, the most impressive thing about Blondie24 is not the high level of play it achieved but the methodology used to get there. Computer programs that can teach themselves to solve problems!

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Blondie24: Playing at the Edge of AI (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence),Interesting 20k foot view of GA and NN application,"This book is an interesting (i.e. light, not too technical) introduction to Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, and potential applications of both. The book covers an appropriate amount of history, and a pretty extensive set of notes for those that care to dive deeper. The core of the story is about applying GA and NN to the game of checkers and creating a computer program (NN) that can play checkers without any pre-learned (human) knowledge about how ""best"" to play the game.

Overall it was a good read. The author argues that the current exmaples of AI success (e.g. DeepBlue in chess) are actually failures as they are brute-force solutions to specific problems with no true ""learning"" taking place. I would agree, but am also not sure that NN+GA represent ""learning"" either. They are another method for searching a solution space [in my VERY simple/humble opinion]. All the ""learning"" happens through solution mutation from generation to generation. Once the mutation/generation process is halted the ""learning"" also stops.

Anyway, worth the read if you are interested in NN and/or GA, but not already well-educated on the topics.",1

Gray's book is not nearly as objectionable in this regard as others (note, especially, the works of Pierre Levy, for truly awe-inspiring levels of incomprehensibiliy). At times he hits on topics that struck me as having a lot of merit (he takes the editors of WIRED to task, for instance, for promoting a sort of hipster-oh-man-this-is-so-awesome approach to technology, and he appropriately skewers libertarianism, etc.). However, I saw two main problems with the book: (1) The author appears to see everything and everybody in the world today as a cyborg of some sort - for example, ultrasound renders the fetus in the womb a cyborg, etc. The concept is so widely applied that it ceases to have meaning. (2) The regrettable lapses into postmodernist drivel, while thankfully infrequent are still discouraging. There is also a little (not a lot) of political correctness a la feminist theory to deal with. For instance, he spends some time skewering (no pun intended) the development of penile implants (cyborg penises!), and points out that the existence of such a phenomena validates the male-centric nature of technology so insightfully criticized by feminist theory. Odd, but no mention of breast implants is made. Purely an oversight, I'm sure!
There are so many serious topics to deal with in the area of our current and future relation to technology - when will someone write a coherent book addressing them?? While this book is an occasionally enjoyable read, in the end it can't be taken all that seriously.",11

Thematic elements such as `On Computational Wings' are clear and edifying, whereas more technical topics such as `How Neural Networks Learn From Experience' cover a lot superficially.

I note that Minsky seems to imply that genes do not have repair mechanisms - untrue, but even this great man admits to off days, although SA's editing role should have clarified this point (as a collection of articles I assume it was even twice published). Similarly, sloppy logic/wording when explaining about engineering another hundred human genes to improve longevity detracts slightly from an otherwise delightful article. Minsky's statement ""Might not such people, who feel they might not have much to lose (when they die), be dangerous?"" is a gem that applies well beyond this topic.",2

Native of Neptune,3.0 out of 5 stars,Reasoning About Knowledge (MIT Press),A philo-technical study of knowledge,"A GENERAL REVIEW

INTRODUCTION
This will be an evolving review, starting Mon 12Dec11 as I work thru reading this book. This current edition is a 2003 paperback, with some revisions from the original 1995 hardcover edition. The Amazon 'Look Inside' utility can get interested parties at least to its full table of contents. This book will occasionally be called by its initials 'RAK' in this review.

GENERAL POINTS
The nature of this book by four authors is essentially a treatment of 'computational epistemology'. Computational in its technical content of unique kinds of logic and many programming issues, and epistemological in its strong philosophical thread about the theory of knowledge. Terminology commonly refers to 'agents', which can be people, companies, computers on a network, etc. That is clearly an appropriate flexible idea for a book of this nature. Two levels of collective knowledge used in the book are the more straightforward 'distributed knowledge' and the more difficult to attain 'common knowledge'. Those are initially laid out in the first two chapters and are fundamental to RAK. An odd story called 'The Muddy Children Puzzle' is emphasized more than once in the book and has some strange logical complexity. This is a fairly long and wordy book, with final Chapter 11 ending on page 461, for an average of 41.9 pages per chapter, including long sections of rather historical 'notes' as the last thing in each chapter.

DEMOTION
On Wed 28Dec11, I demoted this book from 4 stars to 3 stars because of its excessive and gratuitous wordiness. It is as if the authors had to produce over a 500 page book by contract, so they heavily padded out RAK's content, when that much writing was not needed to cover the subjects. Or maybe this is just a hazard of expert 4-author committee writing. Another criticism is frequent use of mainstream text in parentheses, when they fit fine as normal text without that enclosing punctuation.

THE PHILOSOPHY
For any desired background of readers in actual epistemology as philosophy, I recommend the following book: Epistemology: A Contemporary Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge (Routledge Contemporary Introductions to Philosophy) I did consider switching to the linked book early in reading RAK, but will instead read in Audi later. I do own the previous edition of the linked book. In early Jan 2012, I have read the front matter in 2nd edition of this book, and have ordered the expanded 3rd edition at the link from Amazon.

THE HIGHLY TECHNICAL VERSION
Here is another much shorter and more heavily technical book strongly related to RAK: Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Synthese Library) In late summer and fall of 2015, I am actively reading the linked 2007 book, finishing chapter 4 on Sun 27Sep2015.

AUTHOR HALPERN'S RELATED BOOK
Joseph Halpern has written another MIT book Reasoning about Uncertainty which is a logic and probability-based study, with no fuzzy reasoning component as in the great Fuzzy Logic with Engineering Applications, Third Edition.

READING THE CHAPTERS

CHAPTER 1 features the large first discussion of The Muddy Children Puzzle and an overview of the book, including a chapter dependency chart, which I used to later skip from chapter 5 to chapter 8.

CHAPTER 2 is a lot more technical than Ch 1. Most of it is based in a logical system involving possible worlds and knowledge operators with Kripke structures, a fascinating system for this reader. The basic idea is agent 'i' knowing proposition 'p' in state 's' of a possible world for example, which can be much more compactly portrayed in the symbolic system used in the chapter. In sections 2.2 and 2.4, the authors invoke a graph theoretical formalism, but never show a visual graph, which makes that harder to assimilate mentally. (Graph theory is a standard subject within discrete mathematics.) Section 2.3 is a second, more analytical look at the muddy kids puzzle. Then section 2.4 'The Properties of Knowledge', gets into the first axioms / theorems / proofs of RAK. Finally, section 2.5 introduces an event based approach and compares that with the previously introduced logical approach. GREAT CHAPTER

CHAPTER 3 becomes yet more technical again, and is where the computational aspects first get going. Chap3 totals a robust 59 pages. Long section 3.1 (Completeness Results) introduces much new notation and gradually lays out 7 axioms and 2 rules of inference. Several lemmas and theorems are proved, although as many authors do, roughly 40% of the proving activity is deferred to the exercises, which are at the ends of the chapters in this book. There are historical 'names' for various subsets of the axioms which are used, notably 'S5' and 'KD45' as the two axiom groupings used the most in RAK. Section 3.2 is a much shorter and not at all thorough technical treatment of decidability. Section 3.3 is just a theorem and very long proof adding common knowledge, while section 3.4 is the same for adding distributed knowledge, both to completeness of this system. With increasingly long proofs of as much as two whole pages, I have first decided to skip reading selected proofs from section 3.3 onward, especially since some are proving very similar theorems over and over. Sections 3.5 and 3.6 partially explain the theory, and then determine what complexity classes govern validity and satisfiability of the various axiom sets. NP-complete, PSPACE-complete and EXPTIME-complete govern satisfiability of increasingly complex axiom systems, while the co-versions of those three classes govern validity. To close out chapter 3 on this Tue 20Dec11 evening, I read very little of sketchy, hand-waving final section 3.7 on first-order logic's relationship to this knowledge stuff, so it's on to chapter 4 tomorrow. GREAT CHAPTER except Sec. 3.7

CHAPTER 4, nearly as long as chapter 3 starts out in the same tedious verbose way that chapter 3 ended, with much-used new terms and definitions included that we'll have to know. As a matter of fact, nearly all of chapter 4 seems to be the most filled with long-winded descriptive prose and little symbolic content since chapter 1. Actually, Chap4 is a bit stealthy, with the theory and symbolic content mostly buried in the expository prose itself. Maybe one of the four author's writing preference, and if so, not a preference I appreciate. Another so far unique thing in this chapter is the first examples identified by numbers in this textbook, e.g., 'Example 4.2.1'. That feature is also present in some later chapters. Section 4.2 is a short intro to game trees, while section 4.3 is a tiny intro to temporal logic with operators for always, eventually, next time and until. Very long section 4.4 on example systems features a, for me ad nauseum treatment of knowledge bases in 4.4.1, universally called 'KB' and their 'Tellers', going nowhere for 8 pages, so I stopped reading it after 5 pages. Perfect recall, synchronous systems, message passing systems, etc. finish super long section 4.4 with section 4.4.6. Final section 4.5 at last got into proofs involving the 'Ki' knowledge operators around since chapter 2 and was the only section of Chap4 to contain clearly multi-agent content. Two lemmas and two theorems were featured, along with much of the usual verbose and tedious prose writing. It was not at all clear to me from the writing in chapter sections 4.1-4.4 how any of the systems were inherently multi-agent in character, or that they were scaled up to be multi-agent. Fortunately, last section 4.5 alone saved the day for the whole chapter. HYPER-VERBOSE, NEARLY FAILED CHAPTER

CHAPTER 5 was rather like a shorter continuation of mostly poor chap4. I read the whole chapter except for the back 8 pages of large 14 page section 5.2 on protocols and contexts. Sections 5.3 on programming and 5.4 on specifications were both short and rather interesting. Finished chapter 5 on Fri 30Dec11 and jumped to start chapter 8. FAIRLY GOOD AND SHORT CHAPTER

CHAPTER 8 is an interesting incorporation of temporal logic into the knowledge-based logic. It only uses the 'next time' and 'until' temporal operators, and yet in section 8.1 makes an upgraded S5 knowledge axiom set now including the new temporal axioms. A good bit of work. I finally gave up reading RAK at bottom of p. 311 and end of section 8.2, so now onward to an as yet undetermined next read. AN INTERESTING CHAPTER NEVERTHELESS",5
Charles E. Knadler Jr.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Neural Networks for Java, 2nd Edition",software + insights,"The usefulness of this book depends on your purpose. If your primary purpose is to acquire a running start solving AI problems using the author's software this is a useful book. If you want to study neural networks or to develop java programming skills, this is probably the wrong book for you. The author gives good introductions to genetic algorithms and simulated annealing as well as their use in training neural networks. There are also valuable insights for the careful reader; e.g., the approach used for the tic tac toe game (chapter 6) has very limited usefulness, because it took ""nearly 20 hours to train"" the neural network. This raises the question of how long it would take for a more realistic problem. (The author provides the weights, allowing the reader to experiment with the neural network, without the pain of performing the training.) I found the chapters on genetic algorithms and simulated annealing to be the most useful.

The author'a website provides downloads of all his software with liberal licensing.

For self-study, ""Elements of Artificial Neural Networks"" by Mehrotra et al or an older book, ""Fundamentals of Neural Networks"" by Fausett, would be an excellent companion to Heaton, if you would like a combination of accessible theory with a working software suite that can be readily modified to solve real problems.",8
Matthew Skoda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Neural Networks for Java, 2nd Edition",Good book for practical programming,"I've read several author's works on neural networks, and while valuable, they almost always limit the subject to theory.

This book limits it's scope to practice, which is fine by me.... If you want theory, feel free to look it up on wikipedia or one of the billion books on AI that only cover theory.

This book assumes you've read a little theory and jumps straight into practice: in it, the author walks you from hands-on from creating the basic neural nodes to creating and training simple decision nets, to building applications for predicting stocks moves and playing backgammon.

I've ready about neural nets, but was unsure on how to apply them in practical applications: this book clarified their design and usage. However, I will warn you, it's not an easy read, and requires you to have the code loaded on your computer nearby... this book is about practice, and the author pumps a lot of information out.",7
James A. Brannan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Neural Networks for Java, 2nd Edition",Especially good is that there are associated YouTube videos covering his ...,"This author should be commended on a quality product that is accessible to mere mortals. Especially good is that there are associated YouTube videos covering his books. It taught me neural networks practically so that I could tackle ""real"" books on neural networks (i.e. impenetrable books that give you lots of mathematical theory).",1
Neuron,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Introduction to Neural Networks for Java, 2nd Edition",Simple yet effective,"I happened to start reading the first edition of the book and realized quite fast that it was outdated, however after browsing Amazon for a while I decided to go with the same author, and I wasn't left disappointed.

This is a very good book for anyone starting learning Neural Networks. It might not give you everything in detail, but as far as giving a hands on approach to learning NN this is the book to read. If you, like me, happened to get the first edition I would recommend you to upgrade as well. This edition of the book is much more mature.

I would caution anyone that don't know object oriented programming that this book is based that. I bought the C# version of the book as well, and it doesn't seem any different than syntax wise.",8
M. Henri De Feraudy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not Exactly: In Praise of Vagueness,A very readable introduction to the literature,"This is a particularly well written introduction to a certain part of the philosophical literature on vagueness.
The author refutes the idea that vagueness is a fault and presents a certain number of different approaches to the problem
explaining the advantages and disadvantages of each.
You can read this book in bits.
I have training in formal logic, so my view is perhaps a little biased, but all in all I have rarely seen a book by a philosopher in which the author bends over
backwards trying to explain subtle concepts and succeeds like this one.
My only niggle is the chapter on Artificial Intelligence which in my opinion spends just a little too much time (for my liking) introducing the subject before
getting into the approaches to vagueness. I was expecting to see Dempster-Shafer theory discussed and didn't find it.

Not only will you read about vagueness, but you should be better prepared to read works on analytic philosophy, in particular a good crash course on formal logic is given, but I'm not the best judge as to how clear that is, as I know much of that. I'm also glad to see he talks about the work of the great Hans Kamp who does very original and useful work in logic.

This is a fun book on a subject which is disquieting. It might well challenge some of your basic views on reasoning. I have a good friend to whom I read parts of this over the phone, it's that well written.
It's interesting that the author is not just a philosopher by training but also works in a computer science department of a university. This might explain why the book is clear: he has a goal of making software deal with vagueness.",24
S. Huntsman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Decision Procedures: An Algorithmic Point of View (Texts in Theoretical Computer Science. An EATCS Series),Great book for understanding the basics of SMT,"This book's approach is perfect for a newcomer to SMT without much background in logic (like me).

Already-practicing professionals may be disappointed (I heard fairly vigorous objections to the lack of detail and the characterization of Shostak's procedure from one expert), but the book is probably not for them anyway.",1
Husam Abu-Haimed,2.0 out of 5 stars,Decision Procedures: An Algorithmic Point of View (Texts in Theoretical Computer Science. An EATCS Series),Disappointing,"I am very familiar with the field of decision procedures, but I bought this book to use it as a quick reference and a refresher in certain areas. However, when I read the book I was very disappointed. The only good thing about the book is the table of contents and the list of references. Many important results and theorems are missing. No explanations or derivations of any of the presented results are provided.

I was hoping that this book would be a good introduction (or reference) to the field of decision procedures, but unfortunately, going directly to the research papers is a much better investment of your time (and money).

The following references provide an excellent coverage of the field:

1. ""Constraint Processing"", by Rina Dechter. This is an excellent reference on Constraint Solving, which is similar to decision procedures, but focuses more on finite-domain problems.
2. ""Decision Procedures for Bit-Vectors, Arrays and Integers"", Ph.D. Thesis by Vijay Ganesh, 2007.
3. ""Searching for Truth: Techniques for Satisfiability of Boolean Formulas"", Ph.D. Thesis by Lintao Zhang, 2003.
4. ""Efficient Algorithms for Clause-Learning SAT Solvers"", M.Sc. Thesis by Lawrence Ryan, 2003.",24
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unreal Engine 4 AI Programming Essentials,Fails spectacularly at teaching,"While the author(s) of this book seem extremely well-versed in the unreal engine, they are significantly worse at teaching the material they cover. More often then not, this book makes the mistake of ""showing"" you how to program a task instead of ""teaching"" you how to do it. While I can dutifully copy the AI behaviors detailed in the lessons, I often find myself no closer to understanding how and why these behaviors work. A standard lesson looks something like this:

1. Pull from the Array Element pin and search for Cast to MyCharacter.
2.Then, pull from the As My Character pin and search for Get Controller.
3.Get the class of the controller using the Get Class node.
4.Compare the Hero class with the Class = Class node.
5.Pull from the return of Equal and create a Branch node.
etc...

While this might seem all well and good, the ""teaching"" aspect of this book completely falls apart when you realize that there are no explanations as to why I should use many of the nodes. Why do I need to use the Class = Class node? What is logically going on in this blueprint (yes, they don't supply answers for questions this basic)? If, when looking at this example, you find yourself asking any questions, you will be sorely disappointed by the lack of answers. While the authors of this book might know everything there is to know about Unreal, they certainly don't know how to teach it. A plethora of typos, missing steps, and incorrect words only compounds on the frustration.

All told this book seems like a rushed cash grab. While the pages look like slides you would see in a programming class, there is no teacher to guide you through the process.

There is no plan for the book in terms of trying to teach the reader the methods of analysis of Bioconductor in a structured way. All the chapters of the book seem like a patchwork which begin somewhere and end abruptly without any consistency. It is highly puzzling for me since the Bioconductor package seems to relatively well thought out overall. When it comes to writing books, all the authors associated with the Bioconductor seem to abruptly and inexplicably fail. This leads to conclude TWO things 1) The authors do not want the general reader to learn the analysis 2) They are just awful writers. I have used the other official ""Bioconductor"" books too and they are equally awful too. 0 out of 3 is not a good record. Rather than try to make money off gullible public by peddling incremental and useless books, please try to write a book which will truly educate someone. Please give it a try. I assure you, you will better about yourselves. The 2 stars are for the effort. That's all. I understand this is a scathing review.

British_Bill,4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mining: Introductory and Advanced Topics,Good introductory survey to various technologies,"The book serves its purpose of providing a introduction to the various technologies that make up data mining. There are three main topic sections. The first gives an overview of the technologies involved such as fuzzy logic, bayesian probability, and neural networks. The second topic area is more concentrated and focuses on how data mining works. This involves utilizing clustering, association, and classification of data. The final section covers advanced topics in web, spatial, and temporal mining. The only complaint that I would have is that most of the coverage at least in section one is cursory and one needs other reference books for serious work in the field.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python,Great book if you're highly motivated to learn ML techniques!,"I'm giving this book 5 stars because I found it useful in getting my feet wet with machine learning (ML). If you want to see what kind of ML tools are in use now (or at least recently) using free software and you know how to code in Python and you know enough about debugging computer programs to find all the errors in the author's code then maybe this book is for you too.
Pros:
free software (if you can get it to run on your computer...not very easy)
book is very affordable
Cons:
software is devilishly hard to get working (I had to get a commercial version to make it work on Win7X64)
authors code is loaded with errors, you MUST find an errata list and keep it with you as you read (if you run the code)
even the errata list from the publisher is incomplete I found several additional errors and I ran every problem
authors explanation of ML and software is mushy, feels like he's giving you a quick demo in his office on a few interesting ML problems
Most of these follow-along-with-me books have these same problems, I've read many, so I was prepared for frustration but if you're not a coder or if you're new to installing software I'd suggest reading the scikit example pages that you can find on the interwebs.

Gio,5.0 out of 5 stars,Who Needs Emotions?: The Brain Meets the Robot (Series in Affective Science),"Yes, It Is Too Deep for Us Recreational Readers","I've seldom been as challenged by the content of a book as by this one. It's a collection of twelve essays, of varying length and complexity, addressing issues of the architecture/software/operation of the brain - both the human and the artificial. The unifying questions are whether a scientific definition of 'emotions' can be formulated, what separates or unites emotions with intelligence, and whether artificial intelligence is meaningful without an emotional OS.

I've been reading one or another of these essays whenever I've felt bold enough for over a year. Some of them, with ferocious concentration, I've digested. Some have left me feeling remarkably stupid. In general, the essays of ""Part II: Brains"", written by psychologists and neurobiologists, have been digestible, but the essays of ""Part II: Robots"" might as well be written in Sanskrit.

Nonetheless, I strongly recommend this book!

randomdude1978,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simulation Modeling and Analysis (McGraw-Hill Series in Industrial Engineering and Management),5-stars; like a good prostate exam,"This was a tough one to rate... Amazon has a qualitative equivalent for each star rating level; 1-star is ""I hate it"", 2-stars is ""I don't like it"", 3-stars is ""It's okay"", 4-stars is ""I like it"", and 5-stars is ""I love it"". This qualitative equivalent sometimes puts me at odds on how I want to rate something. I'll try to give an example of something that is more common to people than a sim book. I'm a guy and I'm at the age where I'm *supposed* to go in for a yearly check-up. As part of this yearly check-up the doctor sticks his finger in your rectum to help determine if you have prostate problems. Now let's say I have word renowned doctor that is an expert in determining prostate problems and he performs this activity, and let's say he does a 5-star job. Do I now have to say that I loved this procedure? So most of you can now see the conundrum here. To say I loved this book would be like saying I love having someone stick their finger in my rectum to inspect my prostate. On the other hand, this is a great analogy to me for reading mathematically intensive books. They were necessary for my education and the knowledge I obtained from them continues to be necessary for my career. So when I give this book a 5-star review, it is not because I love this book, it is because this book does a good job at setting out to convey knowledge about simulation modeling and analysis concepts.

Btw, this book is very mathematically intensive (for me anyway); especially in terms of statistical analysis. In my career I work around a lot of physics based simulations and ""entity-level"" simulations for defense related scenarios, so I had some misconceptions about the class that I used this book in. However, it was required for my Masters degree, so sometimes you have to just have to bend over and start reading.",3

Clark Williams,4.0 out of 5 stars,Computing with Quantum Cats: From Colossus to Qubits,If you have an interest in Quantum Computers and/or computer history this is a GREAT READ.,"A bit Brit-no-centric (the British invented everything don't you know) but a compelling and interesting read. It is drenched in the history of the participants. I find this one aspect wonderful in any book on technology. Written for the educated in science it is none-the-less not overwhelming by any means and contains very little mathematics. It is an historical approach to the subject.

One small drawback (hence 4-stars instead of 5) is the lack of an ending that offers a closure to the topic. Since the topic is continuing and isn't complete this is not surprising but the worth of an author is in the beginning, middle and the end. The end is sloppy compared to the rest of the book.

white gold wielder,2.0 out of 5 stars,Computing with Quantum Cats: From Colossus to Qubits,Almost complete lack of Substance,"This book was not at all helpful, but
tended to focus just on people and historic
events while saying next to nothing about
the computer, neither classical nor quantum.
One might complain that nothing is said about
the nuts and bolts of the clasical computer.
One might also make the same
complaint about the quantum computer

But things are even worse. One might expect perhaps,
at least some more general information.. Perhaps, for example,
how many atoms on average make up
classical bits of a computer in the 1950's versus,
say that 1990's, and then how many atoms ( essentially
one ) make up one qubit, i.e., one bit in a quantum computer.

The author seemed to feel no obligation to offer anything
concrete at all regarding the quantitive parameters
or logical or arithmetic functioning of the
computer.

I am trying to think of what audience would benefit
from this book but its hard. Any scientifically
literate audience would be amazed by the lack of
substance. I can't imagine any novice getting the
sense that he has gained much, either.

This is why this is such an important book. Not only does this book tackle the topic of organizational modelling, but the the papers are of the highest qualities. Usually edited books are not as coherent as single author books, but in this case the fact that different chapters were written by different people is an advantage. Each chapter discusses a different modelling technique that is used to explain a different issue. This variety in methods makes the book an excellent reference. I would also recommend 'Dynamics of Organizations' which is also an edited book.

N/A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Algorithms for Image Processing and Computer Vision,Excellent cook book of advanced IP techniques,"At its best, this book is a wonderful cookbook of image processing techniques. For example the author's presentation of the Canny and Shen-Castan methods of edge detection is clear and detailed. Full C source is provided for this and all the other techniques discussed in the book. The book does not pretend to be a basic introduction to image processing -- if you do not have Castleman or Pratt or something similar on your bookshelf, you probably should not start by acquiring this book. A possible source of irritation for some readers will be the variation in depth of coverage of topics. For example, when the author discusses wavelets, the coverage is very scant and qualitative. It is well done, but quite different in kind from the aforementioned coverage of advanced edge detection techniques. Similarly, the author will cover specific aspects of image processing, such as motion blur for an image, in the context of a rather general discussion of image restoration. In short, the book seems to reflect the author's interests more than attempting to be an objective coverage of the current state of the art in image processing. Nonetheless, the high quality of the information that the author provides and the bibliography to further coverage of the given topics are well worth the price of the book.

John,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/Crc Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition),A great book for students,"This is an good book on machine learning for students at the advanced
undergraduate or Masters level, or for self study, particularly if
some of the background math (eigenvectors, probability theory, etc)
is not already second nature.

Although I am now familiar with much of the math in this area and consider
myself to have intermediate knowledge of machine learning, I can still recall
my first attempts to learn some mathematical topics. At that time my approach
was to implement the ideas as computer programs and plot the results. This
book takes exactly that approach, with each topic being presented both
mathematically and in Python code using the new Numpy and Scipy libraries.
Numpy resembles Matlab and is sufficiently high level that the book code
examples read like pseudocode.

(Another thing I recall when I was first learning was the mistaken
belief that books are free from mistakes. I've since learned to
expect that every first edition is going to have some, and doubly so
for books with math and code examples. However the fact that many of the examples
in this book produce plots is reassuring.)

As mentioned I have only intermediate knowledge of machine learning, and
have no experience with some techniques. I learned regression trees
and ensemble learning from this book -- and then implemented an ensemble
tree classifier that has been quite successful at our company.

Some other strong books are the two Bishop books (Neural Networks for Pattern
Recognition; Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning),
Friedman/Hastie/Tibshirani (Elements of Statistical Learning) and
Duda/Hart/Stork (Pattern Classification). Of these, I think the first Bishop
book is the only other text suitable for a beginner, but it doesn't have the
explanation-by-programming approach and is also now a bit dated (Marsland
includes modern topics such as manifold learning, ensemble learning, and a bit
of graphical models). Friedman et al. is a good collection of algorithms,
including ones that are not presented in Marsland; it is a bit dry however.
The new Bishop is probably the deepest and best current text, but it is
probably most suited for PhD students. Duda et al would be a good book at a
Masters level though its coverage of modern techniques is more limited. Of
course these are just my impressions. Machine learning is a broad subject and
anyone using these algorithms will eventually want to refer to several of these books.
For example, the first Bishop covers the normalized flavor of radial basis
functions (a favorite technique for me), and each of the mentioned books has
their own strengths.",105
R. Ritchey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/Crc Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition),Great machine learning book for those with rusty match skills or less math inclined.,"For those diving into machine learning who are rusty at math or not a math expert this is a solid, understandable book on the topic. It covers a wide variety of machine learning algorithms, and while it does include some math, the math isn't the primary and only focus like other books on the topic. The math sections are less involved, giving the formulas and basic information the various algorithms are based on, but most importantly it's accompanied by easier to understand explanations and pseudo code/actual code implementations. I certainly hope the author continues to update and maintain this book over time - I've shown this book to coworkers who are also less math inclined and they liked the way the book was written and were interested in picking up their own copies.",1
Todd Ebert,4.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/Crc Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition),"Could be better, but does fill a need in machine-learning education","I chose to use this book for a course on machine-learning for computer scientists that I taught in the spring of 2011.
The main reason for selecting it involved its use of the python language, and a more overall programming-oriented
approach to machine learning. I do believe the author has the right idea, assuming the targeted audience is cs majors who
need some basic introductory exposure to the subject. Yes, the author does walk a fine line between trying to provide some
degree of mathematical rigor, and yet not overwhelming the student with too many equations. In doing so, he trips and stumbles
several times throughout the text, but, in the end, I do believe that the average undergraduate would benefit from this book
more so than from a more traditional math-oriented ML book. So it does fill a niche in the ML literature. To improve the book,
say, for the next edition, I would suggest toning down the ""cs students need to have their hands held when doing math""
attitude that is purveyed throughout the text, and adding a bit more rigor where needed.

Also, I found much of the python matrix code very slick and often hard to follow. For this reason, the final chapter ought
to be the first read (for those students with no python background) and more examples and exercises should be given
that reinforce the matrix manipulations. I also suggest that the next edition include more problems at the end of each chapter,
and simple exercises throughout the reading,
especially ones that help students practice both the mathematics and the programming. Having lots of exercises can help smooth
out some of the discontinuities that are found throughout the text. By ""discontinuities"", I mean at times taking large leaps from
intuitive wordy explanations, followed by jumping into the mathematical models.

A great example of a textbook that succeeds in walking the above tight rope is ""Theory of Computation"", by Michael Sipser.
Every future author who wants to balance accessibility and rigor ought to first read this book for inspiration. Another
great success story is Mitzenmacher's ""Probability and Computing"". So it can be done! And I hope to give the second edition of
this book 5 stars!",7
Ben,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/Crc Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition),If you are new to machine learning - GET THIS BOOK,"At my job I was asked to jump into the field of machine learning for multiple reasons, and having had a moderate background in mathematics with an extensive background in software engineering I have been in search of the ""perfect book"" to combine these two levels of competency. With this book, I have found it.

The author doesn't completely weigh you down with mathematical details, but gently introduces you to the topics in a very digestible and comfortable manner. The author knows you will not be able to understand all of the most intricate details in the subject from one chapter, and so very clearly states, (I'm paraphrasing) - ""We will cover this in greater detail in chapter XX, but for now just understand these are the important things to note...."". Most authors in this field will just dump on you page after page of advanced theory, assuming you pretty much understand it all to begin with; but not this author.

I have recommended this book to all my coworkers who deal with the same tasks as I, and recommend it to any reader out there who wishes to become more familiar with the single-most fascinating branch of computing known to man.",8
Randall K Julian,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/Crc Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition),Outstanding guide to Machine Learning using Python,"I am updating my review of this book because apparently in my first review I didn't do a very good job. This made the review less than useful. I will try to do a better job this time. If it still isn't helpful let me know and I will try again.

Like the title says, this book takes an algorithmic approach to teaching machine learning - as opposed to an applied or example based approach. The expectation is that you would get a tutorial on all the main algorithms rather than how to put various algorithms together to solve a particular problem in, say, fraud detection.

The Contents reveal the algorithm basis:

1. Introduction (types of machine learning, why you would want to do it in the first place and a quick introduction to supervised learning)
2. Preliminaries (Key ideas about the problem of over fitting and the what I consider the most important topic: how to test and know when you have a program that has learned something other than the noise). Here the author also covers some ideas about the role of probability. Calling it ""turning data into probabilities"" is a bit odd, but that's really what we do. Early on he gets the key ideas of the ROC curve out of the way - something many texts just gloss over.

I think the secret to understanding machine learning is understanding the idea behind the bias-variance trade-off (it is also handled very well in The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics) which I used to teach a class and read before I read this book.

3. Coverage of Artificial Neural Networks starting with the perceptron and why you would want to go beyond linear discriminators
4. The multilayer ANN
5. Radial Basis Functions and Splines - this is interesting because, Andrew Ng presents a linear regression as the most basic learning algorithm in his Coursera course which means all of the fitting methods, even when not used for classification are relevant.
6. Is a section on dimensional reduction - feature selection and other methods like PCA and even factor analysis (most people stop with PCA which I personally think is a mistake, because you can accidentally end up keeping the features with all the noise and throwing out the meaningful linear combinations.
7.This is a cool section not seen in basic books on probabilistic methods - sure everyone teaches k-NN, but this one has a nice discussion of Gaussian mixture models
8. Talks about the support vector machine. Most people don't get introduced to the idea that ANN and SVMs are actually very similar - they are both large margin classifiers and so knowing something about SVMs will help, even if you end up with some other large margin classifier (with or without kernels)
9. This section talks about search and optimization. The way Ng teaches machine learning, you always begin with the error surface, take the derivative and then search for a minimum in the learning function. You quit teaching when you have minimized the error on the training set without out driving the error too high on the validation set - so in a way all these approaches are optimization methods.
10. A whole section of genetic algorithms (which I jumped to first) a very clear explanation and a good example that really ran so I could see what was going on.
11. Reinforcement learning
12. Learning with trees - CART trees end the chapter something everyone working in this area should know something about. He saves random forests for the next section (where I suppose it really belongs)
13. This section is on bagging an boosting and then compares the idea of a collection of weak learners (like stubby random trees) as a powerful tool - the idea behind random forests.
14. Unsupervised learning. People tend to focus on supervised learning for a very good reason, but there are lots of examples where the cost of putting a label on a data example is too high, so an unsupervised method is a good call.
15. Coverage of Markov Chain methods (MCMC) - again this does not get covered in every applied book.
16. Graphical models - the Bayesian Network and Probabilistic Network Models along with the hidden Markov models
17. Deep belief networks
18. Gaussian process regression and classification

The book concludes with an appendix on Python - getting started etc. I don't think this is quite enough Phython unless you are already pretty familiar with the language.

A critic of my first review suggested that I just bashed R and didn't talk about the book - not a completely unfair statement. R keeps data in data frames and Python is much more list and directory based. Data frames and collections are related and there are ways to do list comprehension in both languages. and Python has a data frame package to make using R-like constructs easier if you happen to be coming from R and like them (the package is called Pandas) Both are good languages, but I will stand by my original statement that R is a statistical language at its core. Many of the packages are written in C so they are fast (like the ones written for Python). It has been my experience that the open source tools for R development are just what the commentator said: they are adequate. I my humble opinion, R-Studio has a lot of catching up to do to be as good as professional tools like the JetBrains stuff (PyCharm). Look at MatLab compared to Octave. At lest the community version of PyCharm is free. R-Studio is not fast, and he dirty secret of R is that everything you do has to fit in memory at once, so you have to be very careful with memory management or you will run out and R will crash - it happens to me everyday. Almost all of the ML methods are statistically based so R and all the books (like An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics) are totally brilliant. But if you want to see what it is under the hood, I suggest you look at Advanced R (Chapman & Hall/CRC The R Series). This will give you a deep dive on the internals. Compare it to Python Scripting for Computational Science (Texts in Computational Science and Engineering) and make the call for yourself.

I have used both R and Python for both prototyping advanced algorithms and putting code live in production. What tipped the scale for me was the productivity. Now that the data science community has started building state-of-art tools for Python, (not to say anything negative about the statistics community who put all of machine learning on a solid footing), I prefer a rapid development language with good tools, test-first frameworks and solid software engineering practices as part of the culture. The book reviewed here allows you to learn almost all of the algorithms used for machine learning and in the end you will be able to produce fast, readable, testable code.",30
Serac,4.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/Crc Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition),"Very Good, but Fairly Light","This book has sat in my Amazon Wish List for several years. I always put off buying it - until I actually needed a machine learning book.

Pros: Unlike too many technical books, the author of this book is not trying to display his brilliance. This is a nuts and bolts book - not a cookbook, but not a Springer-style book of axioms, either. Reading this book reminded me of school. There seem to be two kinds of professors - one kind tends to prefer examples and problems that display some sort of first principle or other basic and fundamental problem. These professors are good at teaching new concepts, but sometimes fail at teaching the practicalities. The other kind of professor favors practical problems and how-do-I-do-this-for-real issues. This book sits firmly in the latter camp.

Cons: As mentioned above, this book is not a cookbook, and yet is also is not rigorous. For such a practical book, I would have wanted more pseudocode and algorithms. For example, near the end of the book, the author goes over Kalman filters and particle filters. He gives one algorithm for a Kalman filter (whith no treatment to the different kinda and uses of Kalman fitlers), and only a slight description of a particle fitler (and no pseudocode). To be fair, books and volumes are to be had on the subject. But, I was left wanting more.

This book is a good introduction to how to use various aspects and techniques of machine learning. If you a looking for mathematical rigour, look elsewhere. If you are looking for cookbook-style algorithms, use this book in supplement. If you want a practical overview of machine learning methods before setting on your course, buy this book.

Recommended, but with qualification.",2
Hadayat Seddiqi,3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/Crc Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition),"Decent intro to machine learning, nice Python+Numpy code, but many errors","I am somewhat disappointed by this book. Today I'm feeling generous, but it was tough to bump this up from 2-stars because to me it at times created more confusion than anything else.

First off, this is an introduction certainly, probably at the sophomore college level. The math is there but not used especially well, and I believe the intention of the book is to sort of cater to those whose math backgrounds aren't very good. There is certainly a need for a book like this, but it shouldn't be used for more than supplementary material.

There are many errors in this book, sometimes typographical but other times a little more serious. The writing style puts a bit of stress on the reader and I find myself jumping around the paragraph sometimes trying to figure out what is being said. The tone is meant to be casual and simple, but coupled with the numerous errors in the book it really felt like this edition was rushed. This was the most disappointing aspect.

This book was useful to me for clarifying some things, but only because it was a different explanation that wasn't bogged down in mathematical rigor. I think it is a very good idea to have several books on the same subject for which you are studying seriously (I have three or four books on quantum mechanics, and even then it took many reads through them to really understand it). This book served its purpose in that sense. I also bought it because I was eagerly awaiting deep learning topics to find their way into ML texts. Sadly, this book didn't help me as I had been reading papers at this point, but I think it was a good introduction to deep learning and the types of neural networks typically used to build them and I applaud this initial effort by the author to include the material. I did find a few mistakes in the earlier chapters on Hopfield networks specifically, but I don't remember them being serious.

I'm a Python programmer who uses Numpy a lot, and this was the best feature of this book. Most of the time I could quickly glance at the code and see what was really happening, and looking over the included code clarified some things for me as well. For textbooks in computational areas nowadays there's no excuse for not providing code, and I'm very glad to have had that to look at.

Overall, this book could have been a lot better and has the potential to be a really great introduction to ML as its own textbook (at the underclass level, i.e. freshman and sophomore). The author simply didn't put in enough time to revising, or perhaps it was the editor's fault, not sure. The heavy usage of actual code was a big plus for me, and it covered some topics that aren't typically covered (deep neural networks) which was done well. For someone who is somewhat familiar with ML, this is a decent book to sprint through just to review and glean some bits and pieces. For the beginner, it can be a good introduction especially if you aren't as good at math as you'd like to be, but I'd recommend using it as a supplement to something at a higher level (perhaps Bishop's or Alpaydin's book, or even David Barber's book).",13
Kevin J. Schmidt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/Crc Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition),Excellent treatment of a complex topic,"Stephen has done a great job and making a complicated topic accessible. He has mastered the art of knowing when to provide extra treatment of the formulas in the book. The use of code alongside the concepts also helps clarify what is going on. Actually, the code alone is worth the price of the book. It really does make all the difference. I think anyone with some mathematical sophistication (a calculus course, linear algebra, and discrete math) will have no problem reading the book and working through the material. In other words, you don't need a PhD in math to learn from Stephen's great mastery of the topic.",3
Mark L. Fugate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/Crc Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition),A great introductory work covering a broad range of ML topics,"This book presents both theory and algorithmic descriptions of a broad range of machine learning topics. Marsland not only presents the foundational theory behind a wide range of ML techniques but also covers how a programmer can be creative with those techniques. Further, this book covers many techniques not covered in many other books.

I have read many books discussing ML and this is the book that I recommend as a first read.",1
Doug Y'barbo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/Crc Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition),Different than other 'textbooks' on ML,"I first saw this book on a colleague's bookshelf; i picked it up and briefly looked through it. The simple diagrams and the relative lack of equations (compared to e.g., Bishop) might suggest to you that it's a 'beginner' text--and by that i mean that the textbook is only an introduction to ML and doesn't teach you enough so that you can begin writing ML code to solve real classification/regression problems. That's what i though at first, and i was wrong. This is an introductory text, but only in the sense that it's accessible to more or less anyone, but this book's explanation/theory and the practical examples (in python) are brilliantly integrated--the explanation (often summarizing two or three pages of terse equations found in other textbooks, in a single paragraph) helped me grok the code, and the code reinforced the theory behind the algorithm.

I don't think there's another ML book like this--it's aimed right at the blind spot framed by applied math reference-type books such as Bishop on one end, and books like 'Programming Collective Intelligence' which are dense with working ML code, but light on theory.

I also like this book because the code is written in NumPy, rather than in the Python standard library code. NumPy is what you would use 'in the real world' to code an ML algorithm, and if you understand the matrix-driven syntax, then the code is far more concise (e.g., no triply nested recursive loops) than the same algorithms coded using just the Python standard library.

In sum, an excellent book.",21

Michael Conlen,1.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/Crc Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition),Flawed badly,"This review is based on the sections on Artificial Neural Networks; however the issues found there make me unwilling to consider the book for further topics.

The author's treatment of universal approximation is simply wrong. The author states, ""two hidden layers is the most that you ever need for normal MLP learning."" I note that earlier in the chapter the author writes, ""We will think about adding extra layers of nodes,"" so that he is not claiming two hidden layers of edges.

The literature however is quite clear that a single hidden layer is all you will ever need. See

Cybenko., G. (1989) ""Approximations by superpositions of sigmoidal functions"", Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems, 2 (4), 303-314

Thus, when the author later writes about SVMs, ""they do not work well on extremely large datasets, since they involve a data matrix inversion,"" I have no reason to trust this at all. Back to the literature.

My contention is that a book written at this level of exposition should absolutely get these types of facts right, as most readers will be unable to read papers like the Cybenko, which requires familiarity with measure theory and functional analysis.",9
Jeremy Kun,1.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/Crc Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition),Look elsewhere for a serious treatment,"In short: the content is worse than the corresponding Wikipedia articles, and his writing style is condescending.

Almost every chapter has less detail than the Wikipedia articles (and suspiciously similar prose), and Marsland doctors up the content with childish references to Goldilocks and the things you *obviously* didn't retain from high school. On every page Marsland babies the reader, fluffing the writing with constant reiterations of simple facts concerning perpendicular lines and counting methods. If you have any attention span at all, you'll find this book should be a hundred pages shorter.

Finally, and worst of all, his mathematical arguments are sloppy and his code contains errors. He asserts an elementary fact is true by saying that there is no reason to believe otherwise. At points he defines variables by closed-from quantities, but then in the python code he implements the same variables as summations.

The blurb on the back of the book claims Marsland provides complete information and adequate levels of rigor. After reading the book I can only interpret that as ""high school"" rigor. This book is clearly geared toward math-phobic computer scientists or people in other fields. I purchased the book because it has a high rating here on Amazon, but at least for me (a frequent hobbyist in programming with some mathematical know-how), a book like Forsyth is far more appropriate, despite its awful ratings.

The emphasis is on 'overview' however - you can find starting points and intuitions, but you will not be able to to do anything very ambitious just on the basis of the purely technical information here. At one point, the details of how linear classifiers work are swept under the carpet with a faintly crass remark about 'fancy math tricks'. If linear classifiers are 'fancy math tricks', what does that make variational methods for probabilistic data modelling? Note, in fact, that advanced machine learning in general, where fancy math tricks are ubiquitous and unavoidable, is not touched - an interesting implicit distinction.

Pedro A. Ortega,4.0 out of 5 stars,Universal Artificial Intelligence: Sequential Decisions Based On Algorithmic Probability,A gem under a pile of unnecessary mathematical obfuscation,"This is probably the most rigorous attempt to formalize AI. The book succeeds in presenting the state-of-the-art AI theory from a technical point of view, but neglects intuition, and is difficult to read for the novice and thus inaccessible to a wider audience.

The main idea of the book in combining classical control theory concepts with Bayesian inference and algorithmic information theory. The author avoids to struggle with anthropocentric aspects of intelligence (which are subject to a fierce debate) by defining intelligent agents as utility maximizing-systems. The core ideas are, in a nutshell (informally):

1) Goal: Build a system with an I/O stream interfaced with an environment, where inputs are observations and outputs are actions, that optimizes some cumulative reward function over the observations. Two ingredients are necessary: model the a priori unknown environment and solve for the reward-maximizing actions.

2) Model: This is a probability distribution over future observations conditioned on the past (actions and observations). Instead of using any particular domain-specific model, the author uses a weighted mixture over ""all"" models. By ""all models"", the set of all mechanically calculable models is meant, i.e. the set of all algorithmically approximable probabilistic models.

3) Policy: Given the model, all possible futures can be simulated (up to a predefined horizon) by trying out all possible interaction paths. Essentially, a huge decision tree is constructed. Having this information, it is ""easy"" to solve for the best policy. Just pick at each step the action that promises the highest expected future rewards. These are calculated recursively using Bellman's optimality equations.

Why does this work in theory? If the environment is equal to one of the models in the mixture (or ""close enough""), then the mixture model converges to the true environment. The model is updated step by step using Bayes' rule. Since the model becomes more accurate, the policy based on it converges to the optimum. Algorithmic information theory is the main tool to derive the mathematical results.

Does it work in practice? Unfortunately, the presented solution cannot be implemented in practice, because the mixture model is incomputable. Even worse, there is currently no principled way to downscale his approach (and make it practical), since we don't know how to simplify (a) the mixture model and (b) the computation of the policy. The author makes these points very clear in his book. IMHO these are the main challenges for future AI research.

The PROs: This is the first time I see a unified, formal and mathematically sound presentation of artificial intelligence. The proposed theoretical solution provides invaluable insight about the nature of learning and acting - hidden even in very subtle details in his approach and in his equations. Whereas you might feel that classical AI or commonplace Machine Learning theory looks like a patchwork of interesting concepts and methods, here (almost) everything fits nicely together into a coherent and elegant solution. Once you have studied and understood this book (which took years in my case), it is very difficult to go back to the traditional approaches of AI.

The CONTRAs: However, there are some downsides to this book. Hutter is a brilliant mathematician and sharp thinker. Unfortunately his writing style is very formal and many times he neglects intuition. The book introduces difficult notation (although some of it pays off in the long run) that ends up obfuscating simple ideas. The mathematical style of the book is difficult to digest.

To summarize, this books represents a giant leap in the theory of AI. If you have advanced mathematical training and enough patience to study it, then this book is for you. For the more practically-oriented researcher who wants to learn about Universal AI, I recommend reading Shane Legg's ""Machine Super Intelligence"".",16
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Universal Artificial Intelligence: Sequential Decisions Based On Algorithmic Probability,Very ambitious project.,"This book differs from most books on the theoretical formulations of artificial intelligence in that it attempts to give a more rigorous accounting of machine learning and to rank machines according to their intelligence. To accomplish this ranking, the author introduces a concept called `universal artificial intelligence,' which is constructed in the context of algorithmic information theory. In fact, the book could be considered to be a formulation of artificial intelligence from the standpoint of algorithmic information theory, and is strongly dependent on such notions as Kolmogorov complexity, the Solomonoff universal prior, Martin-Lof random sequences and Occam's razor. These are all straightforward mathematical concepts with which to work with, the only issue for researchers being their efficacy in giving a useful notion of machine intelligence.

The author begins the book with a ""short tour"" of what will be discussed in the book, and this serves as helpful motivation for the reader. The reader is expected to have a background in algorithmic information theory, but the author does give a brief review of it in chapter two. In addition, a background in sequential decision theory and control theory would allow a deeper appreciation of the author's approach. In chapter four, he even gives a dictionary that maps concepts in artificial intelligence to those in control theory. For example, an `agent' in AI is a `controller' in control theory, a `belief state' in AI is an `information state' in control theory, and `temporal difference learning' in AI is `dynamic programming' or `value/policy iteration' in control theory. Most interestingly, this mapping illustrates the idea that notions of learning, exploration, adaptation, that one views as ""intelligent"" can be given interpretations that one does not normally view as intelligent. The re-interpretation of `intelligent' concepts as `unintelligent' ones is typical in the history of AI and is no doubt responsible for the belief that machine intelligence has not yet been achieved.

The author's formulations are very dependent on the notion of Occam's razor with its emphasis on simple explanations. The measurement of complexity that is used in algorithmic information theory is that of Kolmogorov complexity, which one can use to measure the a prior plausibility of a particular string of symbols. The author though wants to use the `Solomonoff universal prior', which is defined as the probability that the output of a universal Turing machine starts with the string when presented with fair coin tosses on the input tape. As the author points out, this quantity is however not a probability measure, but only a `semimeasure', since it is not normalized to 1, but he shows how to bound it by expressions involving the Kolmogorov complexity.

The author also makes use of the agent model, but where now the agent is assumed to be acting in a probabilistic environment, with which it is undergoing a series of cycles. In the k-th cycle, the agent performs an action, which then results in a perception, and the (k+1)-th cycle then begins. The goal of the agent is to maximize future rewards, which are provided by the environment. The author then studies the case where the probability distribution of the environment is known, in order to motivate the notion of a `universal algorithmic agent (AIXI).' This type of agent does not attempt to learn the true probability distribution of the environment, but instead replaces it by a generalized universal prior that converges to it. This prior is a generalization of the Solomonoff universal prior and involves taking a weighted sum over all environments (programs) that give a certain output given the history of a particular sequence presented to it. The AIXI system is uniquely defined by the universal prior and the relation specifying its outputs. The author is careful to point out that the output relation is dependent on the lifespan or initial horizon of the agent. Other than this dependence the AIXI machine is a system that does not have any adjustable parameters.

The author's approach is very ambitious, for he attempts to define when an agent or machine could be considered to be `universally optimal.' Such a machine would be able to find the solution to any problem (with the assumption that it is indeed solvable) and be able to learn any task (with the assumption that it is learnable). The process or program by which the machine does this is `optimal' in the sense that no other program can solve or learn significantly faster than it can. The machine is `universal' in that it is independent of the true environment, and thus can function in any domain. This means that a universal optimal machine could perform financial time series prediction as well as discover and prove new results in mathematics, and do so better than any other machine. The notion of a universally optimal machine is useful in the author's view since it allows the construction of an `intelligence order relation' on the ""policies"" of a machine. A policy is thought of as a program that takes information and delivers it to the environment. A policy p is `more intelligent' than a policy p' if p delivers a higher expected reward than p'.

The author is aware that his constructions need justification from current practices in AI if they are to be useful. He therefore gives several examples dealing with game playing, sequence prediction, function minimization, and reinforcement and supervised learning as evidence of the power of his approach. These examples are all interesting in the abstract, but if his approach is to be fruitful in practice it is imperative that he give explicit recommendations on how to construct a policy that would allow a machine to be as universal and optimal (realistically) as he defines it (formally) in the book. Even more problematic though would be the awesome task of checking (proving) whether a policy is indeed universally optimal. This might be even more difficult than the actual construction of the policy itself.",19
Robert Jones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Universal Artificial Intelligence: Sequential Decisions Based On Algorithmic Probability,Axiomatic Artificial Intelligence Theories,"Hutter's book is the most recent attempt to put artificial intelligence on a firm mathematical footing. (For an earlier effort see, for instance,

Theory of Problem Solving: An Approach to Artificial Intelligence, Ranan Banerji, Elsevier, 1969) If successful, such a foundation would permit us to elaborate and explore intelligence by applying the formal methods of mathematics (e.g., theorem proving).

Hutter starts from Werbos' definition of intelligence: ""a system to handle all of the calculations from crude inputs through to overt actions in an adaptive way so as to maximize some measure of performance over time"" which seems reasonable. (P. J. Werbos, IEEE Trans. Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 1987, pg 7)

Finding all of the proper axioms for such a mathematical theory of intelligence is still an open and difficult problem, however. Hutter places great stock in Occam's razor. But there is experimental evidence that Occam's razor is incorrect. (The Myth of Simplicity, M. Bunge, Prentice-Hall, 1963) See also, Machine Learning, Tom Mitchell, McGraw-Hill, 1997, pg 65-66. Rather than saying that nature IS simple I believe that it is more correct to say that we are forced to approximate nature with simple models because ""our"" (both human and AI) memory and processing power is limited.

I am also unsure that we should assume a scalar utility. In Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (Princeton U. Press, 1944, pg 19-20) von Neumann and Morgenstern said: ""We have conceded that one may doubt whether a person can always decide which of two alternatives...he prefers...It leads to what may be described as a many-dimensional vector concept of utility."" Vector utility (value pluralism) has been employed in AI in my Asa H system (Trans. Kansas Academy of Science, vol. 109, # 3/4, pg 159, 2006)

I suppose, then, that I object to the word ""Universal"" in Hutter's title.

I think that he is exploring only one kind of intelligence and that there are others.",5

Steven Marks,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering MATLAB 7,Materful Book,"I am going to also write a review on ""Matlab Guide"", I will be also comparing the two books in the reviews.
If you are considering Matlab as a scientific computing language - look no more. It has licensened the ""Maple Kernal"" as part of its ""Math Symbolic ToolBox"", it uses LAPAK from FORTRAN for the algorithms for Matrix operations; it uses a high level language (very C++ like) and its own consise syntax for matrix manipulations as well as ""Handle Graphics"" to produce impressive looking plots and reports. In otherwords, it combines the best of various approaches. If you do not know C++, I advise that learn that first before attempting to learn Matlab.
Comparing ""Mastering Matlab 6"" (MM6) to ""Matlab Guide"" (MG):
*Both books are NOT for absolute Beginners, I think the assumption is that you will first study the book that comes with Matlab and the supurb ""Help"" Documentation that comes with the program. There are also good starting out tutorials on the net - search: ""Matlab; Tutorial"". The US Navy has a consise tutorial to get you started.
*MM6 does a better job on teaching to the next level beyond the Mathworks supplied documentation and beggining Tutorials.
*MM6 WINS HANDSDOWN ON TEACHING version new to 6.0 specific features. You are short changing yourself by going for a 5.0 text.
*MM6 is geared more towards a programmer/scientist/engineer; whereas, MG is geared to a mathematician. MM6 is comprehensive (800 pages!), but well organized that you can branch off to a given chapter without covering all prior chapters. Because I had a problem to solve, I started on Chapter 18, ""Interpolation"" without any problems. If you have no immediate issue - taking the book in order is advised. BUT THE BOOK IS WELL CROSS-REFERENCED THAT you can jump ahead to a topc of interest.
**MM6 is real modern: There are 4 chapters (out of 28) that delve into the Object Oriented aspects of Matlab, interfacing to C or Fortran, Extending Matlab with Java and integrating Matlab with Windows using Active X. 7 Chapters are devoted to Graphics, Interface, Movies. 9 Chapters are devoted to Topics that a modern Scientist or Engineer would need to know to take advantage of Matlab: ODEs, Optimization, Fourier Analysis. MM6 covers the topics in detail. Other chapters really get down to the nitty gritty of the Matlab programming language.
I believe that MM6 is ideal for an Engineer/Scientist who is looking for a book to take him or her from the Apprentice to a Journeyman level in Matlab. Beyond that, the books would have to become more specialty (Chem E, Controls,...) orientated. This will get you to the plane where you can then focus on your specialty.",52

The value of a third party book (as opposed to the users manual) is that it should be a tutorial and a ""fill in the blanks"" that not present in the manufacturers literature.

Second, the model used by the authors is to create Photoshop plugins so that the basic IO functions and presentation logic are hidden from the user. This makes the book essentially useless for anyone not developing on Winders and paying the Photo$hop license fees. If the sample code were accurate, and more than the barest of pseudocode, it could be useful to a much wider audience, but it isn't.

Paul R. Adams,4.0 out of 5 stars,What Is Thought? (MIT Press),fascinating but wrong,"Baum's book is always stimulating and in some ways admirable, especially in its insistence that there is nothing magical in the brain. But he's wrong in several crucial ways, the same ways that Pinker gets wrong (for example, in ""The Slate's Last Stand"").
1. Despite his neural network background, Baum fatally underestimates the power of unsupervised learning. While he's right that complex networks cannot be explicitly trained without astronomically numerous examples, it's now clear that unsupervised learning (where the number of examples is quite literally astronomical) combined with the rather regular (albeit complex) structure of the world, can do most of the heavy lifting, with supervision filling in details. Explaining unsupervised learning to a lay audience is not easy (I know of no successful attempts) but cannot be shirked.
2. Because of his background, Baum fatally overestimates the power of Darwinian evolution. For example, he completely omits the Eigen error threshold problem, he does not take seriously the gap between the information content of genomes and brains, and he seems to think that adding one bit per generation (which is all evolution can do) is a powerful learning procedure.
3. He's hopelessly starry-eyed about the ability of Darwinian evolution to find ""compressed descriptions"" (though he's spot on in his emphasis on compression). Both evolution and learning are algorithms for adapting, and Baum completely overlooks the possibility that brains can implement the Darwinian algorithm in a different physical medium (synapses instead of nucleotides). To validly draw the conclusions he jumps to, he would have to prove that either the Darwinian algorithm cannot be implemented neurally, or that it would be far too slow (while the evidence suggests that the basic update can be done neurally a billion times faster neurally than genetically). As Dawkins has emphasised, Darwinism is the only way to get intelligence, but this does NOT mean that only DNA can do it.
In sum, a book for the beach, not for eternity.",8
John Harpur,2.0 out of 5 stars,What Is Thought? (MIT Press),Interesting but replete with hasty argumentation,"The main thesis of this book, asserted repetitively, is that the mind is a computer program. Once this is borne in mind, pardon the alliteration, most of the book is reduced to an argument in its favour, rather than an investigation into its credibility. The book often reaches for blunt assertions to support its positions and only afterwards begins a slight retracing of steps. For example, we are told that inductive bias and learning algorithms are coded into the genome. It is obvious, bit of speculation on DNA, evolution and algorithms and out comes the result!

In his observance of Occam's Razor, the author confuses the appeal of the simplest explanatory hypothesis with the belief that he has found such. The discussion of neural networks leaves aside recurrent networks, which are probably more biologically plausible than competitors.

Likewise the idea that the brain essentially 'runs' compressed programs due to evolutionary endowments is unconvincing and philosophically leaky.

I don't want to be over critical of the book as it has brought together many interesting strands of work, but it just has not woven them into anything interesting. There is little new here, whether from modularity or evolutionary programming constraints on neural activity. A lot of it is speculative and several of the key themes are discordant due to under analysis of their assumptions.

Several of the elaborations verge on the frivolous. For example, there is a particularly woolly argument linking the learning of Scheme to ""what goes on in constructing our understanding of the world"" (p. 222). Likewsie in discussing awareness and consciousness, the author relies on the use of 'main' in C to metaphorically explain how information might come together in the brain (p. 413-415). All kinds of reification fallacies come to mind, leaving aside the thinnes of the argument.

The bottom line is that the book pursues a strong cognitivist program (the brain is a computer) without convincingly examining various sides of the argument. I was certainly no wiser off at the end of it.",25

751).

In his book Baum frequently equates reward/fitness/utility, U, with

number of offspring a creature has, N. In fact, a more biologically

accurate model (for mammals) might be U=(N-2)/L where L is the

creature's lifespan.

But Baum is quite UNorthodox in that he believes in an extreme

dependence on innateness. He believes that via our DNA we receive

a large number of computational subroutines which contain a great

deal of knowledge about the world.

Baum believes that ""semantics comes from compression...If one

compresses enough data into a small representation, the

representation captures real semantics, real meaning about the

world."" (page 102) But, unfortunately, a number of DIFFERENT

models may fit the data. As Baum himself admits: ""there are likely

many possible locally optimal solutions as good as the one evolution

has come up with that may differ considerably in detail."" ""There

may be many compact discriptions ...aliens might think of the world

using a substantially different description..."" (page 212) So

something which has ""meaning"" for you, with your model of the world,

may have NO meaning for someone else (having some different world

view). Baum seems to admit as much on page 226: ""...there is some

evidence for an evolved module for religious faith, which might well

exist whether or not there is in actuality an anthropomorphic god.""

Unfortunately, then all meaning is purely RELATIVE and it makes no

sense for Baum to talk about some ""concept really present in the

world."" (page 162) Rather, concepts are defined (INVENTED) by

people in the course of their efforts to organize their observations

of the world. Our concepts need not really exist IN the world. They

are best regarded as mental fictions.

Although Baum frequently distinguishes animal intelligence from human

level intelligence he makes no room for the existance of an artificial

intelligence which is not isomorphic to human reasoning. In actual

fact there are many important applications waiting for an artificial

intelligence even IF it were not fully on a par with human reason.

Furthermore, with regard to human level AI Baum seems only to

recognize the ways in which humans outperform computers. Alongside

the list of things people do better than computers one should place a similar list of the many things that computers do better than humans:

computers have better memory, are better at logic, statistics, and

math, can be diskcopied, etc., etc. ""What people can't do"" (comp.ai,

21 May 1997, R. Jones) I would point out that my Asa H system

(Trans. Kansas Academy of Science, 2006, vol 109, no 3/4, pg 159)

has most of the functionality Baum requires of an intelligence.

It compresses what it learns, is guided by a value function module,

and is hierarchically (self)organized. Perhaps only the vast store

of innate categories is missing; waiting to be learned.",3
Jeff Becker,3.0 out of 5 stars,What Is Thought? (MIT Press),What Is What Is Thought?,"Those who are not yet convinced that the brain is a computing mechanism, or who believe that mysticism is required to explain thought, will find quite a bit of value in this book. The book surveys numerous areas of Computer Science, AI, and even a bit of biology, in an attempt to build a case for the brain as a computing mechanism. The book also wades into evolution to try to explain how it came to be so. The scope of the book is ambitious.
Anyone with a background in AI or Cognitive Science will likely find ""What is Thought"" disappointing as it has little new to say. I fall into this category, and I find a number of aspects of this book unsatisfying.
This is a long book in which there is a short book struggling to get out. The author's main thesis, that the brain is a modular computing mechanism that is the result of evolution, is repeated numerous times at considerable length to the point of tedium. While the author shows his thesis to be consistent with numerous observations, it is never developed to any greater depth. In fact, one of the author's conclusions is that we may never understand the inner workings of the brains ""subroutines"" because, as a result of evolution, they are now so ""compressed"".
The author rarely defines his terms. Merely replacing the words ""compressed"" and ""compact"" by the word ""concise"" would enhance the clarity of this book considerably. The author also seems to be of the opinion that generalization, which is the result of ""compressed"" representations, is the essence of understanding. This view is inadequate for explaining our abilities to plan our own actions and predict the actions of other agents, for example.
Because of the informal, breezy style, the book comes across as an introduction for novices or a position paper rather than a scholarly work. While some may enjoy this style, I find it lacks a certain satisfying clarity and crispness needed for a convincing presentation of such an abstract topic.",21
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,3.0 out of 5 stars,What Is Thought? (MIT Press),Some interesting ideas here...but speculative at many places,"Rapid progress is now being made in the field of neuroscience, and this progress is not merely in theory, but also in laboratory measurements, thanks to the advances in magnetic resonance imaging. Also, advanced and practical applications in artificial intelligence are now a reality. Indeed, applications of artificial intelligence in the business environment are skyrocketing, and there is every indication that this will continue. Still though, the nature of human thought remains somewhat of a mystery, which is a kind of irony, given that intelligence is imputed to humans even without understanding fully what is really going on in the human mind when it is engaged in problem solving, reasoning, planning, or myriads of other activities. We do have non-human intelligent machines, but they are not considered to be by most, with the sole reason being that we can understand the nature of their problem-solving abilities. Will we then continue to view the human mind as exhibiting intelligence once we have deciphered its workings?
This book gives many different insights into the problem of human thinking and just what are its origins. Although written for the ""popular"" audience, much can be gained from reading it regardless of the reader's background. It does indulge in speculation frequently and reasoning by analogy, and it skirts at the ill-defined boundaries of philosophy, but it is worth taking the time to read in detail.
The author has a very specific view of intelligence as is readily apparent when he remarks that human intelligence has the ability to ""understand"" in many domains. Machines in his view though do not have this ability, but are ""brittle"", and cannot tackle different problems on the fly the way humans can. But does ""understanding"", as we frequently impute it to humans, have to accompany successful problem solving? Why is it that we are prejudiced in the requirement of ""understanding"" when we characterize an entity as intelligent? And is the ability to answer questions from many domains or contexts, however vaguely they are presented, really indicative of intelligence or understanding? The author wants to clarify the notion of ""understanding"", this to be one of the goals in the book. He asks whether there is some ""quantity called understanding"" that will serve to distinguish mechanical computation from thought. The author is expressing great insight in bringing this question to light, as it has long been a prejudice that machines are merely engaging in syntactical manipulation, and unable to deal with the ""semantics"" or understanding of the ""meaning"" behind the symbols.
The thesis of the author is very straightforward, namely that Occam's razor, as he defines it, serves as the foundation for human reasoning and the mind. The criterion of simplicity is formulated using Kolmogorov complexity, which is currently the most popular one, at least in the computer science community. Most interesting though is the author's view on compression, in that the human mind functions by using essentially compressed programs. Compression to him is the key to understanding, in fact is equal to it. Compressed descriptions are the origin of understanding, and the human brain has, through evolution and reinforcement learning, acquired very adept programs for a myriad of tasks relevant for human survival.
The author's arguments are interesting, but he frequently uses arguments by analogy rather than backing them up with empirical research. More use must be made of the research in neuroscience and psychology before claims can be made on the functioning of the human brain. Too much philosophical discussion has invaded the author's arguments, and this weakens his case in many places in the book. It is the opinion of this reviewer that those engaged in research into artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and closely related fields should declare a moratorium on philosophical speculation and argumentation. The conceptual spaces generated by philosophical speculation are too large to be practical, as they contain too much information, which is constantly expanding with time because of the lack of side constraints, or ""inductive bias.""
Since the efficacy of the human brain is the result of evolutionary pressures, one would naturally ask what role the genetic code would play. The author answers this question in very simple terms, namely that the generation of mind was due to the training of a compact program. This compact program was encoded as DNA, and evolution was a training process for this program. It took four billion years of this training to be compactified into an expression residing in the DNA. This viewpoint is an interesting one, and it sounds very plausible, but again, it still needs to be supported with empirical evidence.
Much use in the book is made of results from computational learning theory because of the author's belief that inductive bias is the crucial to learning in complex environments. `Inductive bias', as he views it, and how it is viewed by researchers in computational learning theory, is a certain preference in learning one concept rather than another. Certainly it is true, and it has been shown by research in computational learning theory, that inductive bias is useful in pruning the search space and can assist in omitting useless information that is not pertinent to the problem at hand. However, the author's view is much stronger regarding the role of inductive bias: he is claiming that it is absolutely essential for learning in complex environments and therefore that other approaches to learning in such environments will not be as efficacious. His views are thus at odds with certain results in computational learning theory regarding the absence of a ""free lunch"" in randomized algorithms (as reinforcement learning is). The author is claiming, perhaps without meaning to, that learning algorithms that incorporate inductive bias will give essentially a free lunch. The only way out of this difficulty might be to acknowledge that the learning processes used by the brain are still being subjected to evolutionary pressure and hence that the learning processes now being used are not optimized, and are undergoing modification (however slowly).",15

Unless one is a professional game programmer, which I'm not, and contacts the authors there is almost nothing useful here.

D McPherson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science (Mathematics Across the Curriculum),"If I knew enough to use this book, I wouldn't need it.","As an experienced teacher working on a second bachelor's in preparation for a master's, I am saddened to report this is very possibly the worst textbook I have ever seen in my entire educational life.

Two words summarize the flaws in this alleged textbook: jargon and assumptions.

Every sentence sent me to the math dictionary at least twice. I continually questioned why the writer chose not to use plain language when it was suitable, possible, and appropriate.

To make matters worse, each section begins and is riddled with exercises that assume the reader's understanding of the material. Then, the writer adds insult to injury by relying on those assumptions and referencing the opening exercises as if the exercise taught you something. Whatever happened to teach, example, and exercise? Beginning and inundating the sections with exercises that preempted the scant instruction completely convoluted the entire learning process and destroyed any sense of continuity.

In the end, to use the book I first had to try to identify what the writer was trying to teach, and that wasn't always possible. After scavenging internet math dictionaries to pin down the topic, I then had to further troll the internet to find sites that taught it in a way that would help me understand the book. Even then I had to waste obscene amounts of time sifting through exercise text to isolate the relevant instruction.

Maybe this book was written for postgraduate readers, because if you didn't know the subject matter already, you're not likely learning it from this text.",8

The book does offer helpful ""check-up"" exercises at the end of each section allowing you to check if you need to make another attempt at deciphering the previous section's jibberish.

I skim through the book, and didn't find any information that could be useful for the VM I was building. It talks a lot about how a real machine works and how to simulate it in software.

Jill Walker Rettberg,4.0 out of 5 stars,Our Biometric Future: Facial Recognition Technology and the Culture of Surveillance (Critical Cultural Communication),Excellent discussion of biometrics from the point of view of a media and communications scholar,"This is an engaging look at an increasingly important topic in our current society. Gates sees biometrics from the perspective of a communications and media scholar who is interested in representation, and does a good job of tracing the histories of biometrics and discussing the limitations and affordances of this technology, which we tend to accept as objective.

zarraz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Analysis with R,Useful for beginners with no experience,"I highly enjoy the way the author introduces R to users - by having the users analyze a set of data with the role of saving a kingdom during the ancient China era. All the functions introduced in this book are the basic functions anyone needs to start exploring their data in R. I find myself using these functions all the time even though I am now more experienced in R. The user do not have to learn functions that they will never use when it comes to analyzing their own dataset.

I particularly liked her point about facial recognition technology shifting the role of the human face from communication to an indexical sign of identity - as well as (with expression analysis) a site of affect.

zarraz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Analysis with R,Useful for beginners with no experience,"I highly enjoy the way the author introduces R to users - by having the users analyze a set of data with the role of saving a kingdom during the ancient China era. All the functions introduced in this book are the basic functions anyone needs to start exploring their data in R. I find myself using these functions all the time even though I am now more experienced in R. The user do not have to learn functions that they will never use when it comes to analyzing their own dataset.

Overall, the book covers the fundamentals required to understand how R works and provide the basic functions for users to start using R on their own. The author assumes that the user has no prior background on any programming language or even statistics. Hence, this book is suitable for anyone who is thinking of using R but has no idea where to start.

My only complain is the way the book was organized. Starting from chapter 4, the book becomes continuous in terms of the R codes and data analysis. The R output from one chapter is required for the next. This does not allow the user to simply flip to a chapter of interest and start following the author. It is definitely not written as a quick reference.",2

All the functions introduced in this book are the basic functions anyone needs to start exploring their data in R. I find myself using these functions all the time even though I am now more experienced in R. The user do not have to learn functions that they will never use when it comes to analyzing their own dataset.

Overall, the book covers the fundamentals required to understand how R works and provide the basic functions for users to start using R on their own. The author assumes that the user has no prior background on any programming language or even statistics. Hence, this book is suitable for anyone who is thinking of using R but has no idea where to start.

My only complain is the way the book was organized. Starting from chapter 4, the book becomes continuous in terms of the R codes and data analysis. The R output from one chapter is required for the next. This does not allow the user to simply flip to a chapter of interest and start following the author.

I particularly liked her point about facial recognition technology shifting the role of the human face from communication to an indexical sign of identity - as well as (with expression analysis) a site of affect.

zarraz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Analysis with R,Useful for beginners with no experience,"I highly enjoy the way the author introduces R to users - by having the users analyze a set of data with the role of saving a kingdom during the ancient China era. All the functions introduced in this book are the basic functions anyone needs to start exploring their data in R. I find myself using these functions all the time even though I am now more experienced in R. The user do not have to learn functions that they will never use when it comes to analyzing their own dataset.

Overall, the book covers the fundamentals required to understand how R works and provide the basic functions for users to start using R on their own. The author assumes that the user has no prior background on any programming language or even statistics. Hence, this book is suitable for anyone who is thinking of using R but has no idea where to start.

My only complain is the way the book was organized. Starting from chapter 4, the book becomes continuous in terms of the R codes and data analysis. The R output from one chapter is required for the next. This does not allow the user to simply flip to a chapter of interest and start following the author. It is definitely not written as a quick reference.",2

All the functions introduced in this book are the basic functions anyone needs to start exploring their data in R. I find myself using these functions all the time even though I am now more experienced in R. The user do not have to learn functions that they will never use when it comes to analyzing their own dataset.

Overall, the book covers the fundamentals required to understand how R works and provide the basic functions for users to start using R on their own. The author assumes that the user has no prior background on any programming language or even statistics. Hence, this book is suitable for anyone who is thinking of using R but has no idea where to start.

My only complain is the way the book was organized. Starting from chapter 4, the book becomes continuous in terms of the R codes and data analysis. The R output from one chapter is required for the next. This does not allow the user to simply flip to a chapter of interest and start following the author. It is definitely not written as a quick reference.",2
