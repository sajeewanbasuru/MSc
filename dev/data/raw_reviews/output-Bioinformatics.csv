John Mount,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",Actually does something (huge) with the math,"I have been using The Elements of Statistical Learning for years, so it is finally time to try and review it.

The Elements of Statistical Learning is a comprehensive mathematical treatment of machine learning from a statistical perspective. This means you get good derivations of popular methods such as support vector machines, random forests, and graphical models; but each is developed only after the appropriate (and wrongly considered less sexy) statistical framework has already been derived (linear models, kernel smoothing, ensembles, and so on).

In addition to having excellent and correct mathematical derivations of important algorithms The Elements of Statistical Learning is fairly unique in that it actually uses the math to accomplish big things. My favorite examples come from Chapter 3 ""Linear Methods for Regression."" The standard treatments of these methods depend heavily on respectful memorization of regurgitation of original iterative procedure definitions of the various regression methods. In such a standard formulation two regression methods are different if they have superficially different steps or if different citation/priority histories. The Elements of Statistical Learning instead derives the stopping conditions of each method and considers methods the same if they generate the same solution (regardless of how they claim they do it) and compares consequences and results of different methods. This hard use of isomorphism allows amazing results such as Figure 3.15 (which shows how Least Angle Regression differs from Lasso regression, not just in algorithm description or history: but by picking different models from the same data) and section 3.5.2 (which can separate Partial Least Squares' design CLAIM of fixing the x-dominance found in principle components analysis from how effective it actually is as fixing such problems).

The biggest issue is who is the book for? This is a mathy book emphasizing deep understanding over mere implementation. Unlike some lesser machine learning books the math is not there for appearances or mere intimidating typesetting: it is there to allow the authors to organize many methods into a smaller number of consistent themes. So I would say the book is for researchers and machine algorithm developers. If you have a specific issue that is making inference difficult you may find the solution in this book. This is good for researchers but probably off-putting for tinkers (as this book likely has methods superior to their current favorite new idea). The interested student will also benefit from this book, the derivations are done well so you learn a lot by working through them.

Finally- don't buy the kindle version, but the print book. This book is satisfying deep reading and you will want the advantages of the printed page (and Amazon's issues in conversion are certainly not the authors' fault).",46
A. Perrier,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",A frustrating experience,"I was happy to discover that I was not the only one struggling with this book.
I have a PhD in Math and more particularly stochastic processes and everytime I open this book I can't quite understand what the content is.
I've read other Machine Learning books with the same level of math and abstraction and did not encounter this difficulty. 'Boosting' by Schapire and Freund for instance.
The flow of the text is hard to follow. A lot of Jargon is used assuming the reader is already familiar with the notions exposed.
I think I will end up making sense of the text only after I've been working in the field for many years.",22
Matt Grosso,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)","excellent overview, especially for outsiders, ties the field together conceptually","This review is written from the perspective of a programmer who has sometimes had the chance to choose, hire, and work with algorithms and the mathematician/statisticians that love them in order to get things done for startup companies. I don't know if this review will be as helpful to professional mathematicians, statisticians, or computer scientists.

The good news is, this is pretty much the most important book you are going to read in the space. It will tie everything together for you in a way that I haven't seen any other book attempt. The bad news is you're going to have to work for it. If you just need to use a tool for a single task this book won't be worth it; think of it as a way to train yourself in the fundamentals of the space, but don't expect a recipe book. Get something in the ""using R"" series for that.

When it came out in 2001 my sense of machine learning was of a jumbled set of recipes that tended to work in some cases. This book showed me how the statistical concepts of bias, variance, smoothing and complexity cut across both fields of traditional statistics and inference and the machine learning algorithms made possible by cheaper cpus. Chapters 2-5 are worth the price of the book by themselves for their overview of learning, linear methods, and how those methods can be adopted for non-linear basis functions.

The hard parts:

First, don't bother reading this book if you aren't willing to learn at least the basics of linear algebra first. Skim the second and third chapters to get a sense for how rusty
your linear algebra is and then come back when you're ready.

Second, you really really want to use the SQRRR technique with this book. Having that glimpse of where you are going really helps guide you're understanding when you dig in for real.

Third, I wish I had known of R when I first read this; I recommend using it along with some sample data sets to follow along with the text so the concepts become skills not just
abstract relationships to forget. It would probably be worth the extra time, and I wish I had known to do that then.

Fourth, if you are reading this on your own time while making a living, don't expect to finish the book in a month or two.",103
Herc,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)","I would recommend ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning","If you don't have a background in math or statistics, I would recommend ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R"" instead, but if you want a more rigorous book on machine learning, this is the the book for you.

In addition the bound copy, I have the PDF from Hastie's site on my kindle, but for a reference as good as this one, having the bound version is absolutely worth the money. When I'm reading a math text, I tend to have one finger in a previous section, so I can refer back to definitions when I need to, and one finger in the index, which just isn't possible with the PDF / Kindle edition.",3
Alex S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",Fantastic Book for an In-Depth Look at Data Mining and Predictive Modeling,This book is being used as a text for one of my graduate school courses. It is definitely at a high level but goes into detail around concepts and definitions of various statistical methods. I would recommend this to anyone who already has had a decent amount of schooling around math and/or statistics. It will definitely help you to understand various modeling techniques if you can follow along with the notation. If you have taken linear algebra and perhaps a couple of introductory statistics and machine learning/data mining classes it will be accessible. Otherwise you might get lost in the derivations.,3

Junk X. W.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)","Good book, horrible printing","Super awesome book, but the 2nd edition (hardcover) that I got had roughly 50 pages missing ... which I found randomly placed into one of the later chapters. Some of the pages are printed with a crease, which smeared the writing. Others are incredibly light. Such a shame because this book is insanely great content-wise, assuming you have a strong linear algebra and statistical background (this is a graduate level book).",2
MrYellowDuck,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",Avoid the Kindle version of this book,"There are serious issues with the Kindle version of this book. Four types of issues can be seen before the end of the second chapter:
1. The book uses bolded text to refer to matrices - this text is not in bold on the Kindle (iPad version) which makes it extremely hard to follow the notation.
2. There is a table reference that is ""table error"" instead of a figure number.
3. Instead of the symbol for real numbers the Kindle book displays IR.
4. The equations and mathematical symbols haven't been typeset using LaTeX; instead they are low resolution scanned images presumably taken from the paper version of the book. These are readable but fuzzy - not what you expect from a $70 ebook.",7
Dan G.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",it requires a great deal of understanding about linear algebra and statistics,"This book is not for someone trying to learn about machine learning for the first time. As other have suggested, it requires a great deal of understanding about linear algebra and statistics. Advanced skills in statistics is required, and a comfort with decoding mathematical notation is required, as the authors often introduce their own notation. It would be much more useful if the authors had extra sections detailing the mathematical background required for the book. Even general advice on reference material should have been noted, as any book desiring to have practical usability should have. My low rating is more for the general notion that this book is good for those that want to learn machine learning. This book is really for those that want to understand the mathematical reasoning that was used to develop modern machine learning techniques. Thus, this book is for researchers looking to develop new methods that have at least a phd in statistics or some related field of applied mathematics.",6
Bleep Bloop,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)","Fantastic Content, but pages keep falling out :/","The book is great, excellent formal introduction to the methods. The graphics are also really excellent and helpful, and nicely colored.

My only complaint, because really the book content is 5 star quality, is that it was poorly bound. 2 pages have already just fallen out, 1 more and i'm sending the book back. I love springer series texts, and i've never had this issue before.",2
John Phillip Hilbert,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",Great Text Book,"As many have pointed out, this is no beginner's guide to data mining techniques. Rather it is like a graduate textbook. It covers most techniques with enough rigor to recreate the algorithm, modify them intelligently, or simply cite them in statistical detail. I think there is enough beginner guides out there, even on the internet, and I personally needed more a of more detailed reference (think Hamilton's 'Time Series Analysis' or Jackson's 'Classical Electrodynamics').

I cannot comment about any of the alternatives, however I am quite pleased with this book. I especially like how refined the layout is. The book is full of blue chapter and section headings in addition to many intelligently colored plots. Because it is more of a reference, it can be quite dry (I wouldn't want it any other way), however the layout makes it a bit enjoyable. If you are looking for a good reference on this subject, just buy it and don't look back (or fret over the cost).",1
Yeng C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",A pedagogical disaster. This book is written for only one audience: people who hold Ph.D.s in statistics.,"This book is a pedagogical disaster. It is essentially a bunch of topics lumped into one book, with unclear explanations and notation.

I am speaking particularly to the linear regression section. I took two linear models courses in a graduate-level statistics program, and I can say I finally understand the material in here. But the explanations are extremely poor. Note I didn't say poor - but beyond poor. The authors attest that they ""expect that the reader will have had at least one elementary course in statistics, covering basic topics including linear regression."" This seems to suggest that any student who has taken freshman-level/AP-level statistics can handle this material.

Yes, I agree with everyone, you need linear algebra and some mathematical maturity. But not only do you need linear algebra and mathematical maturity, you need much more than that: you need a substantial background in linear models, to even understand how in the world you find a variance-covariance matrix or expected value or a random vector, to understand why N-p-1 is the degrees of freedom for the unbiased estimator of the variance, to understand how in the world one defines differentiating with respect to the beta vector, and perhaps most importantly, to understand that the estimate of the response vector is H * y, H denoting the projection matrix onto the column space of X or the hat matrix.

Some may argue, this book isn't about the ""how"" and that I'm arguing too much about the theory, and that this is more of an ""applied"" book. Simply put, no matter what math or stats book I read, if I can't figure out the results that come out of a book using what is in the text itself and whatever prerequisites are suggested by the text, then it's a crappy textbook. You can't read this book with an elementary statistics background. Furthermore, I don't know anyone with only an elementary statistics background who could understand taking derivatives with respect to a vector.

I don't recommend this book unless you have an excellent grasp in linear model theory. Introduction to Statistical Learning, contrary to popular belief, is not a good prerequisite for this book. I recommend reading Plane Answers to Complex by Christensen, or any similar book, before reading this text.",11
Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",and it is an excelent reference book (unless what you are looking for ends ...,"A bunch of pages were missing and replaced by a bunch of repeated pages.

The contents are superb, and it is an excelent reference book (unless what you are looking for ends up in some of the missing pages, as it happened to me last week).",1
Tony Hong,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)","not a learning textbook for outsiders, but good for reference","I have finished reading the book, but I feel somewhat confused...

Although I think I did pretty good with math in graduate school (Physics PhD from a good school), I find it hard to follow some of the derivations. The book specified the prerequisite level of one elementary course of statistics and some linear algebra. But I feel the actual requirement for math is much higher, especially in the multivariate statistics and matrix representations. I often find myself staring at the formulas and trying to get the big picture.

This book is particularly good in terms of grabbing the insights and intuitions underneath the different methods. It covers a vast majority of different techniques, and trying to present the ideas and intuitions why this method works or how this method is an implementation of a simpler idea, e.g.various obvious or hidden implementations of lasso regularization. This is impressive. No one can do better because the authors are actually leading researchers who either invented these ideas or made significant contributions to their development.

Unfortunately, this book is not a textbook for outsiders of machine learning research. The actual implementations/algorithm are not covered in detail, provided often as-is, and have weak links to the presented formulas. The indices or notations in the formulas are sometimes not mentioned, and some of the key concepts for understanding the principles are not introduced. I presume researchers in this field would usually have a common sense of what they are, but for someone like me, it is sometimes very difficult to follow.

Anyway, it is great to finish this book. I don't know how much I could get from this book, but at least I have some feelings of how deep and how broad this field is, and know where to look if later I encounter problems. I would recommend an outside learner to step away from this book as a principle textbook and only use it as a reference. On the other hand, the book introduction to statistical learning by the same authors are highly recommended for new comers.",4
Nicolas Jimenez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",Necessary book for people serious about applied stats,"This is a graduate level overview of key statistical learning techniques. I bought it as I am currently a student in Hastie's graduate level stats course at Stanford. The book is fairly deep given it's breadth, which is why it's so long. It's a very good book and an amazing reference but I do not recommend it unless you have strong mathematical maturity. If you do not know linear algebra / probability well, you will be lost. If you're like me, you'll also have to do some googling around for some of the stats stuff he talks about (confidence intervals, chi squared distribution...). I personally don't mind this. The coverage of this book is truly amazing. Trevor talks about everything from the lasso and ridge regression to knn, SVM's, ensemble methods, and random forests. It's fun to just flip to a random page and just start reading. If you want to be an expert in this area, you need to have this book. On the other hand if you just want to know basic techniques and then apply them, this book might be overkill and you may be better served by a more elementary text.",7
GEORGE R. FISHER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",THE definitive source.,"THE definitive source. Subsequent to getting this book I had the opportunity to take STATS315B with Jerome Friedman, one of the authors and a giant in the field, and I found it to be an absolute revelation.",2
M. D. HEALY,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",Excellent but assumes considerable background,"This should certainly not be the first statistics book you read, or even the second or third book, but when you are ready for it then you should absolutely read it. But be prepared to read it very slowly and digest each page. Its greatest strength is that it shows how much of modern statistics comes down to a few fundamental issues: bias, variance, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. There is no free lunch in statistics, methods that claim to avoid these tradeoffs only do so by adding more assumptions about the structure of your data. If your data match the assumptions of such methods, you gain statistical power, but if your data don't match the assumptions then you lose.

By looking closely at the assumptions, the book shows how many contemporary methods that look different are fundamentally similar under the hood.

And in my own work I have adopted their use of open circles for the points in scatterplots. These circles are easier to see than tiny solid dots, but overlapping symbols don't cover each other the way large filled symbols do.",15
Kevin S. Gray,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",May Become a Classic,Anyone working in data mining and predictive analytics or in applied statistics in other areas should have this on their shelf.

Vladislavs Dovgalecs,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",For statisticians in data mining,"Here are my impressions about the book.
* The organization of book is clear and concise. No too lengthy and fuzzy discussions. Method and technique explanations are clear though sometimes bit hard to follow.
* Liberal usage of colors. It helps to make drawings more attractive and to show more info. May be too bright for some.
* My parts like SVM and LDA, PCA.... they seem to be explained in quite difficult way. Though it is clear enough and self-sufficient
* There are many references and pointers to original works and related fields. Big plus here.
* Work and results on real sample data. I particularly enjoy it! It helps to better understand each method and its +/-

This is a good book for those who use statistics for data mining. It seems that there is more accent on probabilistic (frequentist) field. Though a reader is expected to have good enough level in maths to grasp the concepts quickly. May not be appropriate for the beginners in the field.",6

Dr. Houston H. Stokes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",Review of Elements of Statistical Learning,"""The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference and Prediction,"" 2nd edition by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman is the classic reference for the recent developments in machine learning statistical methods that have been developed at Stanford and other leading edge universities. Their book covers a broad range of topics and is filled with applications. Much new material has been added since the first edition was published in 2001. Since most of these procedures have been implemented in the open-source program R, this book provides a basic and needed reference for their application. Important estimation procedures discussed include MARS, GAM, Projection Pursuit, Exploratory Projection Pursuit, Random Forest, General Linear Models, Ridge Models and Lasso Models etc. There is an discussion of bagging and boosting and how these techniques can be used. There is an extensive index and the many of the datasets discussed are available from the web page of the book or from other sources on the web. Each chapter has a number of problems that test mastery of the material. I have used material from this book in a number of graduate classes at the University of Illinois in Chicago and have implemented a number of the techniques in my software system B34S. While the 1969 book by Box and Jenkins set the stage for time series analysis using ARIMA and Transfer Function Models, Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman have produced the classic reference for a wide range of new and important techniques in the area of Machine Learning.

The discussion of cross validation is great, and the way it is related to other aspects of the model selection problem is masterly. More generally, the book manages a nice balance between theory and application, and its scope is truly impressive. Thanks to authors and publisher.",1
S. Matthews,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",my big brown book of statistic learning tools,"This is a quite interesting, and extremely useful book, but it is wearing to read in large chunks. The problem, if you want to call it that, is that it is essentially a 700 page catalogue of clever hacks in statistical learning. From a technical point of view it is well-ehough structured, but there is not the slightest trace of an overarching philosophy. And if you don't actually have a philosophical perspective in place before you start, the read you face might well be an even harder grind. Be warned.

Some of the reviews here complain that there is too much math. I don't think that is an issue. If you have decent intuitions in geometry, linear algebra, probability and information theory, then you should be able to cruise through and/or browse in a fairly relaxed way. If you don't have those intuitions, then you are attempting to read the wrong book.

There were a couple of things that I expected (things I happen to know a bit about), but that were missing. On the unsupervised learning side, the discussion of Gaussian mixture clustering was, I thought, a bit short and superficial, and did not bring out the combination of theoretical and practical power that the method offers. On the supervised learning side, I was surprised that a book that dedicates so much time to linear regression finds no room for a discussion of Gaussian process regression as far as I could see (the nearest point of approach is the use of Gaussian radial basis functions [oops: having written that, I immediately came across a brief discussion (S5.8.1) of, essentially, GP regression - though with no reference to standard literature]).",17

I also have about four years of programming experience, notwithstanding that I am rusty.

That said, I am having an extremely difficult time parsing the information in this book, as it consists mainly of mathematical jargon with little explanation of anything. I would definitely not recommend this book as a didactic textbook for beginners or even intermediate level learners in this field.

I am sure the authors are very knowledgeable in this field, but this book is not a good textbook to learn from.

There is not a single appendix at the end of the book. The notation in the book is horrendous and the authors make no effort to be explicit about it more than once or sometimes not even once. I can give many examples of terms being used in the book which have not been defined even once. One example would be about standardizing predictors in linear regression. This has not been explicitly defined anywhere in the book. You can of course find out what that means by googling, but many other such cases make the book hardly self-contained. Overall, I find the authors' capability to explain stuff quite poor (having also taken Prof. Hastie's class at Stanford (I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering)).

Alberto Garciatunon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",This is a great book for someone that understands the notation used,"I would strongly dissuade anyone from buying this book. Approximately 50% of the book is mathematical notation and the author minimally defines the notation that he employs. This is a great book for someone that understands the notation used, but if you are not well versed in symbols then this might as well be Greek. The mathematics itself is not difficult, but the terms that he uses require substantial on-line research. The author also changes the meanings for certain symbols without informing the reader. To me, it appears that he is almost purposefully attempting to obfuscate the material. He definitively targets mathematical PhD students at the expense of other types of students. I am finishing up a Masters in Analytics and this was the worst book that we read thus far. Multi-factor and logistic regression are fairly straightforward concepts and it is laughable how the author overcomplicates such benign material. I question the author's ability to actually apply these concepts in a practical business setting.

These types of books will cease to exist in a few years as new ones emerge that actually explain and teach these concepts in a lucid manner. I am actually speaking with a publisher about publishing such a book. If you truly wish to understand these concepts AVOID THIS TOME!",4

SP,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",Useful research summary; a disaster otherwise,"I have three texts in machine learning (Duda et. al, Bishop, and this one), and I can unequivocally say that, in my judgement, if you're looking to learn the key concepts of machine learning, this one is by far the worst of the three. Quite simply, it reads almost as a research monologue, only with less explanation and far less coherence. There's little/no attempt to demystify concepts to the newcomer, and the exposition is all over the map. There simply isn't a clear, coherent path that the authors set out to go on in writing a given chapter of this text; it's as if they tried to squeeze every bit of information of the most recent results into the chapter, with little regard to what such a decision might do to the overall readability of the text and the newcomer's understanding. To people who might disagree with me on this point, I'd recommend reading a chapter in Bishop's text and comparing it to similar content in this one, and I think you'll at least better appreciate my viewpoint, if not agree with it.

So you might be wondering, why do I even own the text given my opinion? Well, two reasons: (1) it cost 25 dollars through Springer and a contract they have with my university (definitely look into this before buying on Amazon!), and (2) if you actually already know the concepts, it is quite useful as a summary of what's out there. So to those who understand the basics of machine learning, and also have exposure to greedy algorithms, convex optimization, wavelets, and some other often-utilized methods in the text, this makes for a pretty good reference.

The authors are definitely very well-known researchers in the field, who in particular have written some good papers on a variety of machine learning topics (l1-norm penalized regression, analysis of boosting, to name just two), and thus this book naturally will attract some buzz. It may be very useful to someone like myself who is already familiar with much of what's in the book, or someone who is an expert in the field and just uses it as a quick reference. As a pedagogical tool, however, I think it's pretty much a disaster, and feel compelled to write this as to prevent the typical buyer -- who undoubtedly is buying it to learn and not to use as a reference -- from wasting a lot of money on the wrong text.",124
M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis, Statistics, and Graphics (O'Reilly Cookbooks)",best intro to R I've found,"I'm a long time Matlab user, but have been using R for a couple months now. Still on the fence on their relative merits (they're different, let me say), but it's been interesting. I had the help of friends, but this book got me going. I bought probably 10 books, and this is far and away the best place to start. Nice combination of keeping it simple and still giving you a sense of the logic of the software. What it doesn't have is details about specific things (graphics, for example), but it gets you close enough that you can usually figure the rest out for yourself. Great book, well written, good coverage of topics -- at least for my use (analysis of international macroeconomic data).",56
Kelly Maurice,5.0 out of 5 stars,"R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis, Statistics, and Graphics (O'Reilly Cookbooks)",A High Quality Book On R Programming!,"This is an excellent book. I read it from cover to cover. I did not try out the examples however. I found the writing to be very good and the book, although a cookbook, actually provides a great way to get an in depth overview of R. The R packages facilitate the use of the book examples by providing test data in the packages. The book is organized well, especially the file I/O and data structures, as well as the statistics sections.

I have worked with statistics at various levels over the years and taken courses but I wanted to brush up on concepts and applications, and this book was really good for that. I think it is also a decent book for learning programming although one would start using the 1-based paradigm instead of 0-based for indexing and that is kind of nonstandard and used only for math software. But a beginner could learn quite a bit by just playing around with the examples.

The explanations of the statistics concepts was particularly good. The author is very precise with his language and even repetitive (which I appreciated) about the rigorous interpretation of results.

The R software thankfully provides a well designed, open source alternative to Matlab and this cookbook (with its references) is an ideal place to start learning for practical use at work or on projects. I thoroughly recommend it. I found very few typos which for me is one of many quality indicators. The author also writes in an entertaining style making the book fun to read - which is a challenge considering the subject matter could be considered dry (by some).",1
Paulo C. Rios Jr.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis, Statistics, and Graphics (O'Reilly Cookbooks)",A simple and masterful book with many insights - better than many textbooks on R,"With clear and concise explanations covering most of the important areas, this is a brilliant book. It can not only save you plenty of time, but also help you to gain new insights as you learn from comprehensive but short and clear discussions of so many different topics. They are all explained in a such a way that you can directly access anyone of them without having to read the rest of the book. Some highlights:
- The chapter 2 on ""Some Basics"" is simple but mandatory for any beginner.
- Chapter 5 on ""Data Structures"" is one of the best along with Chapter 12 on ""Useful Tricks"". Chapter 5 covers data structures in a clearer and better way than many other books on R.
- Chapter 6 on ""Data Transformations"" shows the beauty and power of R in short but very good examples.
- Statistics with R is covered in Chapter 8 on ""Probability"" and chapter 9 on ""General Statistics"", whereas Chapter 11 covers ""Linear Regression and ANOVA"". Here again the very clear prose and simple examples show these applications of R in a much better way than books on R and ""advanced analytics"" like ""R for Everyone"" (a book that is a big disappointment).
- There is a good coverage of graphics in Chapter 10, whereas the author still found space to treat time series analysis in Chapter 14 with more brilliant examples.
What is missing? A coverage of RStudio, a great and free development environment for R. There is also a lack of any examples covering statistical learning data analysis other than linear regression which actually belongs more to standard statistical analysis.

Sometimes one wants to know how to code something specific and sometimes one wants to know how how to set up a class of problems. This book covers both of these in clear and concise language.

I bought one copy for the office and one for my house. This guy has the ability to write simply and with the mind set of people who are busy and want to get results right away. Of course we'd all love to be leisurely scholars and plow through theory and practice but most of us just need to get things done. A good example is the way he treats ARIMA. He warns you about using auto.arima but does not hide it from you because it is ""dangerous."" The book is full of tips, well organized and is oriented towards beginners, though it gets into depth. So many of the R books I've read absolutely pound you with up front details, some of which relate to obscure concerns, rather than starting with a task. For example, on page 199 he writes ""Problem -- you want to count the relative frequency of certain observations in your sample"" Next is ""Solution"" -- and he explains just the minimum needed to do that job. Some of the tips are just simple time savers, such as the function head(dataframe) to show a few of the dataframe rows at the start and tail(dataframe) to show a few at the end. Finally ....

Although he claims it's not a book to learn R, in conjunction with a basic R book like ""The Art of R Programming"" by Matloff, this book is all you need to learn the hundreds of idioms that make up the daily practice of using any language. However, Mr. Teetor undersells himself by not claiming that it's a book for learning R because I have found it BETTER than Matloff's book as a ""go to"" book whenever I've forgotten something.

Matloff's book, while good, is desultory in a certain sense because it hops around its topics too much and uses tools yet to be covered much later in the book in current examples. The R Cookbook has a beautiful systemization to it. For example, you don't have to wait 'til the middle of the book to see how to see how to read into all the basic R data structures. I/O, usually under-covered in all programming books, has a vital early appearance in Teetor's book.

Our House,5.0 out of 5 stars,"R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis, Statistics, and Graphics (O'Reilly Cookbooks)","Good book, Kindle Annoyances hurt use as reference","The book is 5-star as described by earlier reviewers. The kindle version has annoyances.

Like many, I'd like to replace thick, heavy reference books with electronic docs. My hardware is an ipad, but kindle works nicely on many devices. But for REFERENCE use, this volume's got a problem: The Table of Contents! Here's a fragment:

4.12. Reading Files with a Complex Structure
Problem
Solution
Discussion
See Also
4.13. Reading from MySQL Databases
Problem
Solution
Discussion
See Also

The same, identical subheads are REPEATED under virtually EVERY SECTION HEADING. With a reference, one wishes to quickly scan the list of topics covered. In kindle form, one can see at most 6 or 7 topics per page. Plus ""Problem, Solution, Discussion and See Also"" REPEATED 6 or 7 times per page! Really?

When viewing the book's ""Look Inside"" on the Amazon website, ""Problem, Solution, Discussion and See Also"" are not spewed throughout the Table of Contents. Presumably that is the image of the print version. So one can see about 40 topics per page while flipping thru the Contents in the print volume. And 6 topics on the kindle? I just want to know how can I get my kindle copy to be so useful and eliminate the annoying, useless repetition. Am I missing some trick here?

An orderly, repetitive structure is valuable in computer language cookbook topic treatments. Reproducing this standard structure 6 times a page in the Contents, crowding out useful information....is a painful annoyance. With a reference, one expects to repeatedly scan the topics. I can't believe the author permitted this. But I'm not dropping a star because this problem is with whoever created the kindle version, not with the book.",11
John M. Ford,4.0 out of 5 stars,"R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis, Statistics, and Graphics (O'Reilly Cookbooks)",O'Reilly R Reference,"The R statistical analysis tool has much to recommend it to students, researchers, and commercial data analysts. It contains a powerful set of analysis and graphics commands and a constantly-growing number of add-on packages produced by its large user community. R and most of its add-ons are also available for free under an open source license. It is a realistic and readily available rival to major commercial tools such as SAS and SPSS.

As with everything, there is a downside. R is accessed through a command line interface, has an overwhelming number of commands, and its syntax is difficult to learn and remember. R users, especially novices, will find this cookbook of tremendous help. It contains many brief sections, each of which lists example R code for a specific analysis task.

Tasks supported range from downloading and installing R through more complex data analysis. The sections I found most useful were:

- Finding Relevant Functions and Packages
- Performing Matrix Operations
- Editing a Data Frame
- Generating Reproducible Random Numbers
- Plotting Multiple Data Sets
- Predicting a Binary-Valued Variable (Logistic Regression)

Paul Teetor has produced a well-organized and useful reference book. The sections are straightforward and the example R code is no more complex than necessary. The explanations in each sections are instructive, yet concise. Numerous cross-links between sections allow readers to understand related tasks when writing more complex code. There are even a few sections on common R error messages and useful programming tricks. I recommend this book to anyone working with R who already has some background in data analysis with one or more other software tools.

The comparison with Rudd's book is a little unfair because Rudd's is a cookbook for a vertical subject which the R Cookbook is not intended to be.

I prefer to do things in base R, but this book does not help with that much at all. Second, many times the code written by a plot does not produce the plot without more fiddling that's not written in the book.

wizard_chef,3.0 out of 5 stars,R Graphics Cookbook: Practical Recipes for Visualizing Data,"Good textbook for learning ggplot2 usage, but not a ggplot2 reference book and not a beginner’s guide","I vacillate between 3 and 4 stars on this book. Maybe I’m old fashioned but I prefer to learn a language by first understanding just a bit about the syntax of the language. Others prefer to learn by plowing through lots of examples. This is a textbook approach to learning ggplot2. It is not a reference book. This means, e.g., if you want to quickly find out how to plot 3 curves on the same chart, this is not your book. This book is intended to be used like a textbook where one starts in the first chapter and plows through the book learning the ggplot2 language.

One of the grievous errors the author makes is not discussing the required ggplot2 data structure in the very beginning of the book. Strangely, this important introductory material is stuck off in an appendix at the very back of the book. By always using downloaded data sets from the R library for examples, the user must first download the example data files into R, run the example script and examine the data structure to see how ggplot2 syntax accessing the data set. The book does almost nothing to help the reader understand how to set up the proper data frame for ggplot2. Why not just use simple examples, show the entire sample data set, and explain to the reader how ggplot2 expects to find the plot data to be arranged?

The book assumes the reader already understands basic ggplot2 syntax. It starts out on page 8 with a scatter plot and presents the equation: ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point(). Voila! Fig. 2.1 presents a scatter plot. But, the reader, new to ggplot2 syntax, wonders what aes() is. And, what is geom_point()? What are the roles of aes() and geom_point() in creating the plot and what variables do they use? Subsequent chapters give more complex examples of the various kinds of plots, but shed little additional light on the ggplot2 command structure. Ah, there is a short 10-page introduction to ggplot2 in the Appendix, and on page 379 at the very end of the book there is a single page with a very terse explanation of the role of the components of ggplot2 syntax. I had to look elsewhere to understand ggplot2 and then return to this book for examples of how to utilize the ggplot2 syntax.

I also think the author shortchanged the reader by not contrasting ggplot2 with the ‘graphics’ package built into R that uses the ‘plot’ function. The title of this book should have been ‘R Graphics Cookbook Using the ggplot2 Package.'

In the author’s defense,apparently this was never intended to be an introduction to ggplot2. It is an R graphics textbook giving examples using the ggplot2 graphics package but using canned data sets from the R library. Once the basics of ggplot2 are grasped by the reader, the book does an excellent job of presenting many examples of ways to creatively use the power of ggplot2 to do many kinds of charts and graphs. But, R programmers beginners in ggplot2 beware. This is not the book to use for learning the basics of ggplot2. I am still looking for a good introduction to ggplot2 and have yet to find something between the opaque CRAN-type descriptions like ggplot2-author Hadley Wickham’s “manual” (not helpful for beginners to ggplot2) and the example books like this one.",2

The main catalysts behind my decision to purchase another book on R was my need to get up to speed with using the language to create graphs, and that not only are plotting functions that come with base R not unified behind a common interface and set of options, there exist limitations with base R plotting functions. Of course, there are other plotting functions across the over 2500 packages that have become available to the community, but the ggplot2 package that is the focus of this book is well regarded and grown in use to become one of the most popular R packages since its release in 2005.

What Chang presents in this book is extremely practical. My recent pro bono work to move a client away from Microsoft Excel to this powerful open source platform and industry standard used for both small and big data analytics is partially testament to the usefulness of this book. While I have needed to peruse R package documentation as part of this work, it is not a stretch to say that a majority of what I needed was contained in this book, either as starting points or complete examples. The explanations are very well written and organized, and the fact that all of the pertinent graphs are in color was very helpful when it came time to understanding how ggplot2 can be used for tasks such as plotting multiple lines in one plot, and the data setup that is necessary to perform these tasks, which is a bit different than base R plotting functions, but worth the effort to use since ggplot2 employs universal usage patterns.

While ""R in Action"" might be better at easing the reader into the R language and environment, this book starts with enough R basics in its first two chapters, such as installing packages and loading data, that most will find it sufficient for getting their feet wet, and the author's introduction to ggplot2 in the appendix combined with Chapter 15 (Getting Your Data into Shape) are not only well done, but very succinct for busy professionals. After discussing bar graphs, line graphs, scatter plots, and summarized data distributions, the author presents annotations, axes, legends, and controlling the overall appearance of graphs, followed by discussions on facets, miscellaneous graphs, and outputting for presentation. If you are new to ggplot2, you will probably need to touch a majority of these chapters to some degree in order to get up to speed, but information is easy to find. Very well recommended.",6
steve_oakland,5.0 out of 5 stars,R Graphics Cookbook: Practical Recipes for Visualizing Data,Very useful addition to my R library,"I have Hadley Wickham's book on ggplot2 ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (Use R!), which is a great introduction to advanced R graphics. However, since that book was published in 2009, a few updates in R and ggplot2 have made some of the tricks I used for plots obsolete and I've had to refer to the online ggplot2 documentation to update my code. The R Graphics Cookbook makes this task of finding best practices for ggplot2 much easier, and provides some really concrete examples. This R Graphics Cookbook and the ggplot2 book make for a powerful combination.",7
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,R Graphics Cookbook: Practical Recipes for Visualizing Data,SASGraph Relief,"Others have done a great job noting the strong points of this book for R programmers. Those aspects combine with another to help out converts from SAS, like my husband.

He likes that there are not only recipes, but underlying reasons. The book provides insight into how R is intended to work. This is the difference between understanding the basic concept of cut-and-paste as opposed to knowing just the steps for doing it in one operating system.

He also likes that the explanations provide gobs of useful search terms. These are great for solving challenges not contained in the recipes.

Must be a good book. He no longer grouses about how ""easy things used to be with SAS,"" and tends to build complex charts with R now, instead of Libreoffice.",1
A. Longo,5.0 out of 5 stars,R Graphics Cookbook: Practical Recipes for Visualizing Data,Helpful with graphics and R in general.,"I have been using R on a Linux laptop. I keep statistics for an organization, and I use R to make displays. I worked with it to make displays equal to what I could do in my professional career using software not available to me now. My experience with R is through ""R for Dummies"", much practice, and using help for R available online. I found myself learning things as I read on page 3. I sat down to read a couple of chapters and then skimmed the book. I am pleased with the authors style of writing and his presentation of the data. It is helpful that he uses some example data sets used in the ""R for Dummies"" book. Also, the author introduces you to several other R packages that provide useful tools for handling data. In short, I am well pleased with this book, and it will be useful to me.",1
William Venables,4.0 out of 5 stars,R Graphics Cookbook: Practical Recipes for Visualizing Data,this is a very useful book and I'm finding out a lot from it,"Despite the anaemic title, this is a very useful book and I'm finding out a lot from it.

That said, there are a few quibbles I should point out.
- The code is largely pretty good, but not always the most graceful. For example, the author appears not to have known about the bquote() function, and at one point he uses a very tortuous technique to solve a problem that bquote() would have handled with simplicity and grace. There are other places where I would have done things differently, but chacun à son goût, I suppose.
- This is really a book about ggplot2 and the hadleyverse, which is a dynamic place at the very least. The chapter on data manipulation with plyr and reshape2 should probably be replaced by one on dplyr and tidyr, which are now the preferred tools (partly for simplicity, partly for efficiency and partly for generality). The author can hardly be blamed for this, but the next edition, if there is one, should probably look fairly different in this part, at least
- Lattice is largly absent, which is a shame, and low-level methods with grid itself, which would have been useful in some places, is not mentioned.

I recommend this book, but to be most useful it should be taken along with Paul Murrell's more in-depth book, R Graphics (2nd Ed).",1
Ilya Grigorik,5.0 out of 5 stars,R Graphics Cookbook: Practical Recipes for Visualizing Data,A picture is worth a thousand words,"Creating graphs in R is both an art and science: the science part is up to you, since you're the one familiar with the dataset, and this book fills in the ""art"" part by providing an excellent collection of recipes for how to create and customize just about any type of graph.

All of the examples in the book are based on ggplot2 library - if you've been using the built-in graphing tools until now, check out the appendix first, the switch is definitely worth it. Conveniently, the examples are short and to the point, explain all of the options, and rely on built-in datasets to enable easy experimentation. Next time you need a custom X, just open up the appropriate section, review the options, and you'll be up and running in no time.

This book is an excellent reference, and one I'll be keeping close to me. Having said that, it's also much more than that. Part of the value of this book is also showing what's possible with R and ggplot2 - answer: a lot! If you're serious about R, then this is definitely a book worth picking up.",2
R. Pardee,5.0 out of 5 stars,R Graphics Cookbook: Practical Recipes for Visualizing Data,Loved it,"Wonderful to see so many excellent visualizations (in color even) and the code that produces it. This will be a ready reference for me for years to come.

My one disappointment is the result of an unrealistic expectation I somehow formed. I had hoped the book would convey something of an intuitive sense for ggplot2, so I would e.g., instinctually know when a given change I wanted would be covered by a geom, or an asthetic, etc. Alas, that is not the case. But it's hard to fault a book whose title comes right out and says ""this is a cookbook"" for not giving the underlying philosophy/gestalt of the ggplot2 package.

Most definitely worth the time & $.",2

C. Andersen,3.0 out of 5 stars,R Graphics Cookbook: Practical Recipes for Visualizing Data,"A book of ggplot2 recipes, without a rationale","This book is essentially a collection of examples of doing very specific graphical methods using ggplot2. Perhaps that is all it seeks to be; the clue being in the ""cookbook"" of the title -- implying a collection of recipes. What this book lacks is a discussion of the rationale underlying the use of ggplot2, leaving the reader to infer as much as possible through the experience of multiple examples (much as a good cookbook will have an introductory discussion of how various ingredients work together). This is fine if all you intend is to stick to some very specific graph styles, but makes it challenging to tailor a graph to a specific problem. Considering the extent of the examples, a chapter summarizing the theory behind the use of ggplot2 would be really helpful. I'm hesitant to buy the official ggplot2 book (ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis), as it seems well-understood that ggplot2 has evolved dramatically since that book was published, and it seems a lot to pay for a book which doesn't match the package in current form. Based upon the reviews, I had assumed that this book would fill the gap.",13

applewood,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge,Fascinating!,"Jeremy Narby's study of shamanic knowledge and DNA is a fascinating and easy to follow discussion of his experience as a Western trained anthropologist gradually learning to see outside the narrow tunnel of his conditioning. He does this by attempting to see with a parallel vision (one eye shamanic, one scientific), and he tells his story in a conversational style that lets the reader share in the sense of discovery. It's also a quick read (the last 100 pages of this 257 page book are made up of extensive notes and bibliography), but sure to encourage further study (at least on the personal level if not within the hallowed halls of science).

As he says; ""My approach in this book starts from the idea that it is of utmost importance to respect the faith of others, no matter how strange, whether it is shamans who believe plants communicate or biologists who believe nature is inanimate."" (p.145)

The hypothesis he comes up with, simultaneously far out and down to earth, is that the knowledge of shamanic experience is coming directly from DNA - that mysterious intersection of psyche and substance (spirit and sense) at the root of all Life. The implications of this intuitive and logical perspective are expansive, and ultimately are based in a vision of Life being a consciously driven (i.e. intentional) phenomena.

Much of what he says is a direct critique of science (and the blinders inherent to its Western form), and he obviously gives more respect and credence to the methodologies and conclusions of the Amazonian shamans than science is willing and able to. But he also is no naive new-age enthusiast. Again, Narby perceptively comments, ""To my mind, a truly hallucinatory session is more like a controlled nightmare than a form of recreation and demands know-how, discipline, and courage."" (p.148)

Here's to the hope that this know-how, discipline and courage stays vibrant and alive amongst the Amazonian shamans.

The only improvement I can imagine is to see him do an updated edition to incorporate what has been learned both in biology and anthropology, as well as what Mr. Narby has continued to learn in the last 15+ years.",1
Plastilina_Ve,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge,"Excellent book, nicely written, but too many distracting notes (half of the book, actually!). All in all, recommended.","This is a great book by Jeremy Narby (his best, to some people). His theory of shamans going into molecular level awareness (and communication) while hallucinating on plant medicines (namely Ayahuasca) is REALLY well researched. The whole history of how he came up with this idea is worth the price of the book itself, because of its contagious enthusiasm. This book was originally written on french, and this english version in flawless: great choice of words, and everything is very clear.

Now, there were a couple of things that bothered me (and this is just my personal opinion). The book has too many notes, that actually take you away from the narrative, and while they are intended for adding comments or further proof to sentences and paragraphs, they are absolutely distracting and annoying. And let me tell you this: half of the book are notes! The main content of this book reaches only half of it. The other exact half are notes, notes, notes, notes and the rest of the necessary parts (bibliography, index...).

The other minor thing that bothered me (again, in my personal opinion) is that Jeremy Narby only took Ayahuasca once in the whole history, and that's it. Just one time. Then he spent the next ten years of his life studying that one experience, coming up with the main idea of this work. Just for the sake of the history (and most definitely as a help for his research) he could have use a couple more of those Ayahuasca experiences.

All in all, this is a very interesting book, and, while those things above bothered me (specially the far-too-many notes!), I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in shamanism, ethnobotany, medicine plants, the Amazon's indigenous culture and in avantgarde anthropology.",5
Michael S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge,A journey and a hypothesis,"Too many scientists and journalists venture into the world of shamanic practices and spiritual experiences via psychedelic means and return with an absent drive to preserve the scientific grounding of such experimentation. For example, as brilliant as Timothy Leary was, his actions upon great experimentation with psychedelics became detrimental not only to himself, but also to future scientific and medical research in such areas. In this book, Jeremy Narby does an excellent job of navigating the tricky terrain between subjective experience in experimenting with the spiritual and offering an anthropological analysis of the culture he set out to investigate. Narby never loses credibility as a scientist or anthropological researcher, even as he speculates on the biological basis of spirit communication from ayahuasca usage. His book serves as a research journal as he investigates the practices of indigenous people, but slowly morphs into a personal journey that ultimately leads to a wildly speculative, but highly intriguing hypothesis that he backs up with biological research and thematic comparisons.

If there is any complaint, it's that the book is too short, but ultimately Narby's work here is simply the formulation of a hypothesis for further investigation and discovery.",2

The author, Jeremy Narby, spends time with cultures primarily in South America immersing himself in their culture, trying on their perspective, so to speak. He focuses on DNA, as that seems to be the source of the evolutionary process, the way an organism changes to adapt and to ""be"" in its environment. Organisms can be ""known"", by taking into the body certain plant extractions. Through this process, one can gain knowledge, not just about plants and animals and their uses, but also knowledge about more metaphysical matters. Mr. Narby does his research thoroughly; about a third of his book is research footnotes.

CDaniels,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge,"See how indigenous shaminism parallels modern science, which is hardly any good for anything anyways? WTF?","Interesting thesis, fleshed out with extensive notes and citations, which take up almost 45% of the book. But Narby lashes out at the modern global culture and scientific anthropology a bit too enthusiastically. He seems to resent the academic establishment for not taking a work such as this seriously. His main thesis is, that shamans, particularly South American shamans under the influence of hallucinogens, gain access to biological information on the molecular information from the DNA. I was prepared to consider this. Then he insists on tying this to the possibility of some sort of disembodied collective intelligence of living things that challenges modern Neo-Darwinist theory. I was then expecting as thorough an exploration of evolutionary theory as the basis for molecular DNA, but for some unknown reason he instead rails against compartmentalized science, and introduces Crick's ideas about an extraterrestrial origin for life, and ""panspermia"". Why is molecular biology worthy of comparison to indigenous shamanism, but evolutionary theory not? Then he points out modern scientific ignorance about the origins of life, concluding that shamanism seems unconcerned with the beginnings of life altogether and he then expounds on the value of contemplating mystery. He seems to spoil his own hypothesis by introducing pseudoscience and mysticism. If he kept exploring modern biology and parallels with Amazonian shamanism he might have convinced me. But instead he turns on the very science he uses to support the validity of the indigenous experience. To use a metaphor, it was like being offered a puppy for sale, then being told ""I don't want your damn money anyways! How dare you put a price on this precious puppy!"" Like, whatever.
Perhaps his next book fleshes out the scientific biology-shaman connection, but the chip on Narby's shoulder keeps me from putting out any money for it. I would have been more impressed if he explored the shamanistic worldview and left the DNA connection as a brief sidenote, instead he tries to real in the reader with this tidbit then hit the reader over the head with his critique of modern science and the modern global perspective. I am still feeling the bruises. Maybe I'd pick up something he collaborates with other writers on, but otherwise I'll pass.",5

The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge is a unique look at the question of consciousness, intelligence and knowledge as seen through the eyes of an anthropologist who opened himself and his mind to what some would consider ""primitive"" or radical means of ""knowing"".

Mark Gibbs,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge,Definitely on to something,"An excellent book. Essentially the author is saying that basically all the world's ancient cultures worshipped a giant serpent of some description. Yet they had no contact with each other as far as we know - and some, such as the Siberians - had no contact with snakes. The author suggests that the shamans took similar trance inducing herbal compounds which enabled them to see visions etc. Inevitably they saw giant snakes. The author tries this with some Amazonian shamans and he also has experiences with these giant snakes - like anacondas or boa constrictors. Sounds cuckoo..but the truth is most of us at some time have a dream with large snakes in it. I know I did. Anyway, he connects it to the molecular level, which is to say that he thinks the shamans got down to the DNA level which is represented by the double helix, intertwined snakes. Interesting, but needs more work.",6

The symbol, often encountered in shamanic, drug altered states, is shown to have been used over and over to represent the source or essence of life, as if it were somehow imprinted on the human subconscious.

Katie,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge,Extremely Thought Provoking!,"In ""The Cosmic Serpent"", Jeremy Narby shares both his mental & physical journey concerning shamanism & the biochemical, neurological, and pharmacological information understood by the shamans of various ""indigenous"" peoples of the Amazon. This is truly an amazing journey!

Through his travels & research, Narby realizes that the Amazon forest can be likened to a huge pharmacy - and that the ""natives"" would have to have some form of biochemical/neurological/pharmacological knowledge & insight in order to combine & create their various ""medicines"". But how could they obtain such knowledge without all of the ""fancy"" scientific tools we have here in ""civilization""?

Narby finds his answer after spending time with a well-respected shaman in the Amazon - the knowledge is imparted to them while in a hallucinogenic trance brought on by a brew called ayahuasca, which Narby decides to try for himself, resulting in some really intense insights into mind, body, and soul.

It's the author's hypothesis that shamans, with the aid of ayahuasca, are able to take their consciousness down to the molecular level, which allows them access to biomolecular information. But, because of the scientific tendancy toward rationalism, no research is considered to understand this further.

One of the most interesting parts of this book for me was the discussion concerning DNA & its' possible link to the double serpents/double helix revered in many indigenous societies - are they already aware of what we know about DNA? Could they know even more?

I recently saw a documentary re: an anthropological find where several statues were found that showed 2 serpents. From these statues, the scientists determined that this ancient civilization worshipped a snake or serpent God. After reading this book, I had to wonder if maybe they're wrong...

Overall, I found this to be an interesting, thought provoking, page-turning read. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in spirituality, shamanism, anthropology, & the biological sciences - it has a lot to offer!",16
Carlo Muttoni,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge,A great trip!,"This is a compelling story about the difference between scientific and shamanic power.

Riley James,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge,Incredible Ruminations,"This book takes you on a wild ride of DNA, mythology, and culture and somehow integrates them. The only problem is you have to be somewhat of a believer in the first place to allow Mr. Narby to buckle you in and hit the thrusts. Really though, it is a fascinating cultural study that never claims to be true or untrue, it just reports what was said and seen. There is a power to ayahuasca and hallucinogenic drugs of which we still don't know the full extent. This book is far-fetched but in today¡¯s rapidly changing world it¡¯s not impossible that we (from the modern world) will not soon agree with them (from the 'primitive' world).
The best part of the book is the way it personalizes and characterizes DNA. After reading it it¡¯s all you will think about: how much is DNA effecting everything we do.
It¡¯s a fascinating read. It points out simple similarities like the fact that the double helix is shaped like a snake but then goes into detail that I can't do justice to here. If you have any interest in DNA or anthopological studies then this book is a must.",6

Serpent worship is the worlds oldest ritual. From the stone age and through every civilization and religion the serpent has played a cosmic role. Jeremy Darby now shows us that the cosmic serpent still has a role to play. My favorite section was when he explained DNA and that it communicates. What I walked away with from this wonderful book was the idea that our DNA communicates via biophotons. Each cell in our body communicates from within and without. The organelles within communicate withe each other and then the cell itself communicates with other cells thoughout the body.

Our human body is made of billions of cells communicating with each other via DNA. We are a billion cells working together as one, much like a super organism. In our case we are a super organism with a super consciousness. Somehow we lost the ability to communicate with the individual DNA around us and within us. The primitive shaman though have retained this ability and can tap into it through visions, dreams and hallucinations.

DNA is the energy that is life. Nothing has life without it. IT is the living breath of God within each of us. IT is the Cosmic Serpent.",3

The theory is so comprehensive that the book almost feels light the way that Narby runs through it, however this is quickly dismissed when you realize that about a 4th of the books contents are his sources.

An excellent book to have in your collection if you are part of the movement of people around the world working towards unlocking the ancient mysteries - this is a crucial component.

This is a book written, fueled and experienced, with an obvious passion, an undeniable passion, a true quest of the mind and imagination!! The indigenous Shamans know a great amount of unexplained wisdom, maybe they did not know about DNA in a rational scientific sense, but they do know! Altered states, be they natural ( exhaustion,sonic driven=drums, N.D.E. or botanical, or food deprivation) or from a synthetic compound produced in a lab, or from the highly psychedelic DMT, which our brain produces, are real!

I'm not an academic (my only brush with science came with biology, chemistry and physics classes in high school and then with a couple semesters of physical and cultural anthropology in college) so I cannot speak to the science in this book. However, I am compelled to write this because as Narby was making his connections between DNA and serpents, I had to stop reading as a chill overtook me. For those of you who have read the book, you'll understand the next set of references. I put the book down and I looked at my right arm. On my right bicep is a black graphic tattoo that I designed, incorporating the Christian cross, the sun and Ouroboros. On the inside of the same arm is a tattoo of entwined twin snakes doubling as the handle of a dagger. To this day, I have never been able to sufficiently answer what compelled me to draw these tattoos and get them done. They are the only tattoos I have. I should also say that I got these tattoos about a year or two of heavy LSD, psilocybin mushroom and MDMA (which affects levels of seratonin in human biochemistry) use. Coincidence?

They play with it, they lick it, they kiss it, and they are threatened by it. It is their best friend, because it nourishes them.

However, his argument that indigenous people truly understood the structure of DNA and gained this knowledge from what the plants told them was not convincing. There were some interesting connections, but I found that Mr. Narby tended to read a lot into his findings. At certain points, I was even annoyed by the leaps in logic and hasty conclusions.

On a more positive note, the story itself is interesting and underlying concept for the book intriguing and thought provoking. When I shifted gears to thinking of this as very speculative and following it like ficition I found it more interesting. While I believe the author was sincere in his attempt to rely the facts, I think he got very caught up in his theory and tended to see proof for it where in fact the evidence was less than certain.

This book is certainly not a scientific treatise. It is a good story that raises some interesting issues about shamanism and the validity of information gained from altered states of consciousness. It raises interesting epistemological questions and certainly entertains, but I found it to be light in terms of making a good arguments for the central premise of the book.",64

David Klein,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Healthcare Informatics: Improving Efficiency through Technology, Analytics, and Management",Best overview and practical guide to understanding Healthcare Informatics landscape,"This book is one of the most comprehensive writings on Healthcare Informatics that I've read. The author summarily describes the goal of the healthcare industry is to increase delivery of quality care with a simultaneous decrease in cost. How to get there has been the subject of public debate. What’s not debatable is that we have been on a non-sustainable course (with increasing costs and aging population) and that Healthcare Informatics can improve our lot.
Why now?
The author states that due to 1) Scientific advancements, 2) Digital convergence and 3) The rising cost of healthcare around the world there is an opportunity and need to increase the delivery of quality healthcare with the simultaneous decrease in cost. He is very well versed in the use of data and data analytics from his overall industry experience. I relate and am surprised to see more diagnostic and maintenance care information regarding my automobile than I do on my own health records. Or that my grocer has more buying and consumption information than my own doctor has readily available.
The author reviews why the healthcare industry has had more challenges but, now has an even more important need and opportunity. The industry is beginning to unleash a torrent of electronic data and now at the same time there is an increase in sophisticated analytical tools is available. The author reviews traditional analytical tools as well as completely new tools currently in development such as predictive analytics and cognitive computing.
Highlights from the author explains how seven years of investment to get to Electronic Health Records (EHR) from initiatives such as: Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and The Affordable Care Act and resulting shifts in Medicare payments from pay for service (volume) to pay for outcomes (value) is creating opportunity in the industry to try new processes and technologies.
Technology advancements in Interoperability, Mobility and Decision-Support analysis and Big Data tools promise to have an impact in Clinical and Operational areas according to the author. The author presents a comprehensive and practical guide to understanding the landscape and for developing a plan and policy for you.
The Opportunity
Four Areas of opportunity: 1 Financial activity, 2) Compliance issues 3) Quality improvement in clinical and operational activities and 4) Customer Relationship Management in Healthcare. The promise and hope for achieving the goals is the application and mining of Health Informatics information tools. Some have already been used in other industries but now can be applied to EHR’s and Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) platform information as well as new tools like Six Sigma applications with a bigger potential opportunity in applying even newer tools for unstructured and big data analysis on clinical information, blogs and social media venues to be included in clinical diagnostics and for CDC epidemiology alerts.
The impact of big data on data analysis is huge with the potential to improve patient outcomes, save lives change the healthcare standard of care and manage resources more efficiently to lower overall cost. We need to get to a sustainable healthcare system. The challenge is actualizing the opportunity for you and your organization and also across the Healthcare value chain in the continuum of care. This book offers a practical guide to impact Healthcare sustainability with the implementation of data/data analysis technology in the nascent Healthcare Informatics landscape.

Spruce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Computing for Biologists,Exceptional Resource,"Update:
THIS BOOK MADE ME SHINE!
One of the exercises in the book involves using building a program using regular expressions to modify the format of lat/lon data into a .kml-readable format.
Guess what my employer asked me to do today?
Yup, manually reformat hundreds of lines of lat/lon data.
It took me 20 minutes instead of tedious hours, and I was paid for completion of the job, not the hours.

In science, it is all about efficiency and building a better mouse-trap. This book teaches you all the great shortcuts to stand out in a competitive field of study.
THANK YOU PCfB!!!!!

My Background:
I am a biochemistry and molecular biology graduate who is learning BioPy and R to aid in my ability to process and understand large data sets. I've been reading books on python and bioinformatics, but they are often either too cryptic or too basic. Until I found PCfB, I couldn't find a book that got to the real meat of bioinformatics and biological data processing/management.

Review:
If you are pursuing higher education in science, buy this book. Seriously, put this book into your cart now.

Now that advanced computer skills are in great demand by employers in scientific disciplines, I really think a course involving this material should be mandatory in any undergraduate chemistry or biology department. But it isn't, so buy this book and catch up. This is the information they should have taught you in college.

PCfB is probably best for people who have a basic understanding of computers. The book is neither written for experts nor for novices and fits well at the college level. It provides sufficient detail and complex examples without interjecting excess esoteric programming theory.

The only downside is that the book is catered towards OSX/UNIX, but to be fair, the authors include how to run commands on windows and linux.",6
PJB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Computing for Biologists,Excellent Resource,"This is an invaluable text for anyone looking to demystified computing. While the examples tend to be biological, for instance dealing with DNA sequences or specimen collection data, I think this textbook will be useful to readers in many different fields of science. In fact, a lot of the text focuses on data acquisition, organization, and management, and is applicable to readers from a variety of fields.

This book was recommended to me by a number of biology graduate students that used in it seminar-style courses on bioinformatics. I had no previous experience with programming and was pretty intimidated by programming and computing in general. However, this book helped me get over that fear quickly! It builds a strong foundation in a variety of computational methods (particularly programming in python). With this foundation I was able to take advantage of a lot of online resources that were previously beyond my understanding. In this book, I quickly learned a number of basic strategies for data collection and analysis that would have saved me weeks of work had I known how to employ them earlier in my graduate career. I'm glad I know them now and I look forward to building on the skills I developed with this book!",2
A Reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Computing for Biologists,Extremely Valuable,"This is one of the most valuable and useful books that I have read in a very long time. This book is also extremely timely - given how reliant on computers the analysis of biological data is becoming. The authors clearly and concisely walk the reader through a broad range of extremely useful computational processes that will increase the efficiency of how any biologist stores, analyzes, and/or manipulates their data. Most of my colleagues know that they could be using their computers, and analyzing their data, more efficiently; but many do not know where to start, or are intimidated by the vast ""computer programming"" section of their local bookstore. This book acts as an excellent intermediate step - providing clear (and biologically relevant) examples of how a few key skills can immediately alter daily tasks. The authors then point the reader in the necessary direction for those who wish to learn more. Briefly, some topics that I found particularly helpful were: (1) the use of regular expressions to quickly modify text files (who hasn't suffered through manually doing this to convert the output from one program to the input of another?); (2) the fairly extensive introduction to Python programming and some of its uses; (3) the friendly introduction to MySQL (which can otherwise be very intimidating); and (4) the information on vector art. I also appreciate that the authors focused on Open Source programs; which makes all of the examples/programs available to anyone. I would highly recommend this book to all biologists - full stop. I also want to thank the authors for writing it - it has been a huge help to me, and couldn't have come at a better time.",13
Zach,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Computing for Biologists,Exactly what I was looking for,"Fantastic book. Clear, accessible presentation that wastes no time honing in on the subset of computer skills guaranteed to deliver the most bang for the buck for the average biologist/ecologist. I was using this stuff literally the next day after I read it and have enjoyed major gains in productivity + decreases in frustration. I wish I'd read it the moment I stepped out of undergrad. It's worth mentioning that the focus is on data management/preparation, and not so much on analysis, for which the authors refer the user to R or Matlab. This book coupled with a good one on the stats program of your choice is all you'd need to get churning on your analysis.",2
Carolyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Computing for Biologists,Saves a LOT of time,"This is an incredibly good book for anyone in science who wants to know how to do everything more efficiently, using free software. It's great to work through chapter-by-chapter as a tutorial, but is also a really handy reference. It covers a variety of topics, including graphics manipulation, regular expression, and a thorough introduction to python. Plus a lot of little things you never thought of doing, which add up to a lot of saved time & effort. Within weeks of starting to read through PCfB, I put together a pipeline to handle automated counting of beats per minute from 6-hour long heartbeat records. SO much more efficient than what I had been doing. It's also a very easy read; the authors do a great job of explaining and walking you through the topics in a way that's useful and easy to follow. This book is exactly what it says it is: a guide for biologists who want to work more efficiently without going back to school for computer science degrees.",1

It is the perfect book for health science personel who wants or needs to handle big amounts of data and who wish to do more of the analysis themselves.
It can be used by newbies or people whit some experience who feel the computer handle aspects can be done more practical.",1
Myself,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Computing for Biologists,Highly recommend this book to every biologist.,"I am a graduate student in biology and frequently feel like the learning of new skills, that are extremely useful for my present and future work, requires the commitment to that learning for a longer time period than I actually have. If these skills are in another discipline, then the commitment has to be even stronger.
The main thing that should be changed about the book Practical Computing for Biologists is the title. A more suitable and informative title would be ""Demystifying computing for biologists"" or even ""Demystifying computing for scientists"". The authors clearly explain how to tackle problems that biologists in all career stages face frequently, and in doing so, introduce the fundamental concepts of computer science. By reading the book, the biologist learns that he/she can write a one line command in the terminal window (which take 30 seconds), that will save him/her hours of work. The scientist can also create a small program that will peruse archives of data (be it genomic data, ecological data, literary data) with a defined frequency to look for specific information. This way, a daily routine spent in front of a computer can be replaced by this program and time can be used in other tasks (in the case of biologists, bench work, paper writing, etc). And while writing and running these problems, the scientist gets familiarized with words and symbols such as bash, ""shebang"", sudo and { }.
The authors lead the reader through the intricacies of computer science without the readers knowledge, and without the need to purchase software, as the one required is mostly open source.
This book will not make you an expert in computer science, but you will certainly feel like you started understanding the field. For students, this may be further developed with more specialized books that are recommended by the authors, but they won't feel like they are learning a completely foreign language and will know what to look for to suit their needs (learning how to print ""Hello world!"" may be a good start but it is hard to feel that this command will ever be used in the more complex tasks that we have in mind related to our research).
Professors and senior scientists may feel that this book gives them an understanding of the tools in computer science that can be used in their own research. They may not wish to learn further computing, but they will know how to read and interpret programs created by other parties to analyze the ever increasing amount of data that is created in their labs.
In general, biologists will react to the teachings of this book with a ""Awwwwwwww!"" of enlightenment, and will want to further develop their skills because of the motivation associated with the successful running of the programs created.

So, in summary, this book may be one of the most useful books you should have in your library (or on your desk). You will find yourself consulting it over and over again. If someone tells you they need to write a program to look for specific motifs in a bunch of sequences, you will have the notion of how that is done, and hey!, you may even be able to help out!

I recommend this book to anyone working in biology. Really.

Marsupial Tail,4.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Bioinformatics,A good INTRODUCTION,"I am a researcher with background in applied mathematics and molecular biology working in areas that involves moderate to heavy use of bioinformatics. I have several comments:
1. This is a good INTRODUCTION to bioinformatics. Probably a motivated high school student can understand most of the text.The language is straight-forward, clear, concise, and at points even humorous. Most important sections are covered.
2. It is not a quantitative approach, nor does it give details into the usage of data mining, statistics, or machine learning algorithms. The only programming aid this book might have to offer is some instruction on PERL. It does not talk about R, MATLAB, or any other packages. This book does not go into details about how any of the experimental procedures work, such as gene sequencing, X-ray diffraction, NMR, etc.
3. The recommended readings after each chapter are HIGHLY recommended. They are the go-to if you want to supplement the sometimes superficial text.

Luis-Durham,4.0 out of 5 stars,Learning R: A Step-by-Step Function Guide to Data Analysis,but then your creativity as a data analyst will be limited and probably you will end up writing poor code. Alternatively focusin,"If you want to start learning R, there several things you may want to consider. There are two kind of skills you want to cultivate: programming skills and actual data analysis ones. In principle, you can learn techniques alone, but then your creativity as a data analyst will be limited and probably you will end up writing poor code. Alternatively focusing only on coding may make you a good programmer, but it will be hard to get started on putting your skill into practice.

Any book should strike a tradeoff in where to stand between training you in these two topics. Cotton's book try its best in this and does a pretty good job. The first part of the book, covering the intricacies of the language is the one I found most useful. I has all sort of good advise and explanations on the data structures and functions you can use. It is appropriately applied - not just about computation and programming, but actually links how they are applied in the actual data analysis. In this sense, this was the most original and interesting part of the book. The second part of the book, covering data analysis techniques was more conventional but still good. As such, there are perhaps better books if you are interested on any of the two sides (""machine learning for hackers"" is very good to learn how to apply the techniques and seeing them in action; ""Introduction to statistical learning"" is a bit more theoretical; Advanced R or The Art of R Computing are unbeatable about teaching the language, although a bit dray).

The approach of Cotton is really instructive. He is friendly, he write well in a easygoing fashion and the book is full of useful tips that helped me to understand how the language merge with the technique.

The book is not encyclopedic, it does not cover every single topic (there are better books for that, Matloff and Wickhams books are better). Instead, it does a really good job as a tutorial that walks you through many topics that are somehow not covered in many other books -the chapter that covers factors and dates is perhaps not something you will deal with everyday, but very useful if you have to.

Overall, I think the book teaches you really well how to play with the R language.

A very final remark. I've seen other comments that suggest this is an introductory book. The book hardly takes things from scratch. If you have never written a line of code, you are likely to find it, particularly the first part, pretty dry. It is more an intermediate text, otherwise you will find yourself wondering why you need to know all these pages about data structures if you just want to learn to load a csv file and run a regression.",3
Anonadunk,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning R: A Step-by-Step Function Guide to Data Analysis,Great walk-through of R,"A great walk-through of R. Helpful and readable for people who know a bit of programming, and probably for those who don't.",1
Metalsand,5.0 out of 5 stars,Business Intelligence Guidebook: From Data Integration to Analytics,Informative and Useful for BI,"This textbook is a rare thing. Not from it's difficulty in obtaining, or due to the price being well below the norm of $100. What is rare about it is that it actually feels like they are trying to make it for someone who wants to learn the information, rather than simply writing it for a class; that is, it prioritizes learning over merely informing.

I found my first indication of this as I went to place sticky-note flags marking the individual chapters for later study - I typically do this so that when referencing one chapter I can more quickly get back to it. I realized that the flags were coinciding with these black markers on the side, and quickly realized that the way they printed the book off, there are black lines on the side that indicate where the part starts are, and where each chapter was. I know this is a small thing, and really not relevant to the actual content of the book, but it's just so refreshing to see that the publisher or author was concerned about efficacy rather than merely the bottom-line.

As for the content itself, there is little ""fluff"" or waste throughout the book. As I said before, it's designed with the task of informing in mind, and as such, it does not go off on tangents or over-explain anything. Anything that requires a tangential explanation is typically all contained within the same chapter. In a classroom setting, I could see this being useful if the book is being used to explain a specific subset of a field, as you can easily skip sections irrelevant to the classroom without having to summarize the preceding section.

The only thing missing from my ""checklist"" when it comes to textbooks would be a summation of the individual chapters - summation of chapters are typically a staple of most textbooks. However, when I considered that the chapters were written with minimal waste, I instead feel that a summary would be unnecessary. The chapters are generally as long as they need to be, ranging from 10 pages to 40, and there are pages in some chapters that give a decent enough overview of information, such as in the first chapter when it concluded with a definitions table, something that no further chapter finished with.

Overall, it's a good textbook about explaining Business Intelligence, and it's nice that it doesn't cost any limbs to purchase. If I had the option to choose between this and other textbooks, I can't see any reason not to choose this book. The only other thing I'd like to note is that I am a MIS major, so it's possible that I might be overrating it by a star simply because I was more familiar with the subject matter and did not get confused with any of the sections that another might, but even if there was a section that would make less sense to someone not directly involved in the field, I still feel that it would be a useful resource well worth the price.",2

SN,5.0 out of 5 stars,RNA-seq Data Analysis: A Practical Approach (Chapman & Hall/CRC Mathematical and Computational Biology),"Excellent, detailed introduction to RNAseq technology and application","Having now purchased a few other books on this topic from Amazon, I have to say this one is the best if you need an introduction to the field. The others could be 1) downloaded from your university journal subscription, and 2) focus much more on theory and suited better suited for those already familiar with the topic. They could still be useful but I doubt you would use them by themselves - you would probably find yourself looking up a lot of other information online or consulting other books.

In contrast, this book is very self-contained. It covers all the basics of RNAseq analysis with a pretty detailed look at a typical pipeline. It covers many different available tools and even has a step-by-step code approach for using many of the common/popular tools. Most of the book uses either R or Bash for the code. It covers, RNA isolation techniques/QC, library prep methods, different sequencing platforms and how to choose, overview of RNAseq applications, preprocessing reads/QC, alignment, transcriptome assembly (including de novo), quantitation, Bioconductor packages, differential gene expression, differential exon usage analysis, annotation, visualization, and small/noncoding RNAseq analysis. I was happy to see that it covers a lot of the QC metrics, what they mean, and in what context they are important. Overall, this is a very thorough book.

As a beginners guide it will get you the furthest compared to the other books currently available as of this writing. It will easily get you to that point where you are comfortable enough with the terminology and general pipeline for you to easily search for the answer to more detailed and specific questions online which is the biggest hurdle for this field.

I would recommend the following papers to compliment this book:
""Count-based differential expression analysis of RNA seqencing data using R and Bioconductor"" by Anders et al. 2013 in Nature Protocols - a step-by-step code-based analysis guide that uses EdgeR/DEseq2
""A survey of best practices for RNA-seq data analysis"" by Conesa et al. 2016 in Genome Biology - a good summary of the basic metrics for QC and experimental design",2

S. Fann,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introductory Statistics with R (Statistics and Computing),Excellent intro text for programming stats in R,"R is a useful freeware that can represent a hurdle to students and/or professionals who do not have formal training in computer programming. This book helps to clear those hurdles, and introduces a solid foundation from which statistics users can build new tools for their specific analyses. The rest of this review is broken up for experienced and new users.

****If you do not have a solid foundation in statistics, this book is not going to help you bridge that gap. Although the title is ""Introductory Statistics with R"" the author is clear that this is a book to learn how to program intro stats with R, and is not designed to teach any statistics tools. The author assumes you understand statistics and does not clarify statistics terms like p-value, test statistic, degrees of freedom, ANOVA, and the like. ****

New to R:
Although it may sound like a conundrum, the only way to learn a program is to program. Thankfully learning R can be easy, since the program is free, installs well on nearly all machines, and has detailed help files in various languages around the world. This is an excellent book for the R beginner, but I must stress the importance of ACTUALLY PROGRAMMING while you read this book. You CAN NOT read this book cover to cover and expect to learn R, programming doesn't work that way. This book can be a great resource for people who are brand new to R, but it requires hands on utilization of the source codes provided. Thankfully, this step is made that much easier for new users with a detailed explanation of how to obtain the ISWR package used with this text. Like everything in R, packages are free, and contain suites of functions and sometimes data. All the code in this book utilizes data from the ISWR package, so it will be easy to implement the code yourself and get the same results as the author.

Familiar with R:
Someone familiar with the notation in R can read this book cover to cover and find it enlightening. I had been programming in R for coursework in undergraduate statistics for four years before I found this text. It has a lot of useful data management code that people who taught themselves or learned for classes not dedicated to teaching the program will probably find useful. I found a lot of time-saving code that I wish I had known years ago!",24

Felipe Ortega Soto,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introductory Statistics with R (Statistics and Computing),One of the best introductory books for R,"I have prepared and delivered introductory courses and workshops on statistics and R for the past 3 years. As part of this work, I have reviewed more than a dozen different introductory R books. This is one of my favourite choices (if not my top one). Pete Dalgaard has been a member of the R Core Team since 1997, being a very active and knowledgeable expert on statistics with R. This quickly becomes apparent in the book, since you will find many tricks and smart procedures to accomplish many R tasks, most notably in the data preparation stage (where you spend 70-80% of all working time).

A previous requirement is to acquire basic knowledge on the statistical tools and techniques presented throughout the book. This volume is focused on performing statistical analyses with R, not offering a complete introductory statistics course. However, each chapter starts with a very useful recap of foundations and theory details for the statistical methods and tools presented in it. You can also find good references for further reading.

Summarizing the main positive points:

* Very clear explanations. The writing style is direct, informative, easy-to-follow.

* Content organization is very clear. Every chapter has been conceived as an independent unit that you can read separately (except for the first introductory chapters to R syntax and routinary operations). Thus, you can either read it cover to cover or just jump directly into the chapter or section of your interest (as a reference).

* There is an accompaning R package 'ISwR', that can be found in CRAN (as usual). It includes all datasets and utility functions presented in the text. This is a must to speed up practical sessions using this text as a reference, as well as for self-study.

* Chapter 10 on ""Advanced data handling"" is simply *invaluable*. You will find yourself recurrently visiting its content in your daily work (well, until you master all these tips).

Perhaps my only complain is that the books reflects the main field of interest of the author, as almost all examples have been taken from the Health Sciences. For example, I guess this is the reason why this 2nd edition includes a chapter on survival analysis (also useful for engineers, but under the different name ""analysis of time-to-event data"") but it does not include any chapter about times series models or analysis of longitudinal data in general. In any case, I am sincerely thankful to the author for this decision, since this was my first approach to this very interesting technique that I have been using from then on.",7
J. Becker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introductory Statistics with R (Statistics and Computing),A good basic introduction to R,"This is great basic introduction to statistics and the use of R.

kmir,3.0 out of 5 stars,Introductory Statistics with R (Statistics and Computing),Too Superficial,"While most reviews on the book are positive, I would like to warn the potential buyer that this book *cannot* provide more than a very first quick look for someone who is totally new to R and wants to play around a little.

Here is the good stuff:

All the example code I tried (I am almost done with the entire book) works. Browsing this book and trying out the code exemplified is a no-brainer and completely frustration free.

Here is the not so good stuff:

If you seriously want to a) learn something about R or b) use a book to help you through serious analyses of your data, you should look somewhere else.
Regarding a), the R-intro file that comes with the R base installation contains more information on R as a programming language, how data are read by R (categorical variables as factors, e.g.) and how models can be specified. I hope that other books out there will provide even more information, but this R-intro is not a bad place to start. If you want to do b), this book will help you load your data into R (and even that is a little limited, see other reviews) and maybe create the most standard first analysis (but who is ever interested in that?) Not to mention the missing (and sometimes incorrect! - see page 119 on standard error of the mean confidence intervals) information on statistical procedures, you will need to look somewhere else to calculate basic statistics such as, e.g., partial or semi-partial correlations.

All in all I decided to give the book 3 stars based on its superficial user friendliness. You will not be able to really learn from this book, however.",32

The 'igraph' package is pretty extensive, but this book will give you enough tools to explore what else the package can do.

It also covers the basics of doing network analyses. It doesn't go very deeply into any topics, really (nor does it have proofs or much theory), so it is best used in conjunction with (or perhaps after reading) Kolaczyk's other text (http://amzn.com/038788145X ).

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),wait for the errata to fill in before buying,"Before buying, look at the book description at the publisher's website (oreilly.com) and click on the ""errata"" link. Check to see how long that list is. If you can live with cross-referencing this list with the book, then buy it. Otherwise, there are probably better books out there.

As it is, I am somewhat proficient in R and bought this book as a crash course for a better understanding of the basics, especially the graphics and statistics. After barrelling through roughly half of the book, I found many references to functions or parameters which were never explained or were explained later in the book (without saying so at the first reference). For someone who is hoping for a quick read through most of what R has to offer, this is like hitting a brick wall.

The book helps the reader understand a lot of what R is capable of, but it seems to be done in a more slip-shod manner than I was hoping for. I get the feeling the author was rushed in getting this to print. Or, they didn't pay the editor enough.

As an aside, the formatting for the kindle edition has been working pretty well. I've actually been reading it on the cloud reader without problems (be sure to download a local copy for offline reading).",50
Bill y,4.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),"Solid book, covers broad areas, maybe too much on programming","I bought the 1st edition and this one is just as good. Generally he uses straightforward examples and provides enough detail to ""make it work."" So, for example, with just a few pages of reading I can understand how to technically get decision trees to work in R. For the general reader I think Adler spends way too much time on object programming concepts and the behind the scenes structure of R. It would be nice to have time for theoretical detours like he uses but for those of us who are busy and in the commercial world, such material should be relegated to an appendix. I really don't care how R does it, in the same sense that I do not car how my car optimizes its gas/air ratio -- I just want it to go.

That being said, Adler's range of knowledge is astounding and I certainly trust what he says. With just a slight tweak to meet the needs of his less academic readers, the book would be perfect.",1
Andrew D. Matuszak,4.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),Good Reference Book,"This is a solid reference manual that warrants a place on your desk if you regularly use R for business analytics. My chief complaint is that the index is very slim. If you've read through the book and remember seeing a particular topic but don't remember where it was exactly, the index can be frustrating because it isn't very thorough.

As far as content, it covers most of the basics although its ggplot section is too basic (R Graphics Cookbook is a good alternative if you are looking for specific plotting help).

I'd recommend getting both the hard copy and the ebook (only around $5 dollars through Oreilly's site if you've purchased the hard-copy).",1
Erik Gfesser,3.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),Not a tutorial or the encyclopedia one would expect,"This book is the second that I purchased this past year to get up to speed on the R language and environment, along with ""R in Action"" and ""R Graphics Cookbook"" (see my reviews), but unlike these other two, I fully expected this book to serve as a reference rather than a tutorial, based on my experience with ""UNIX in a Nutshell"" many years ago. However, through my experience I was quickly made aware of the breadth of the R language, which includes over 2500 packages that have become available to the community, and I have instead typically used this book as a starting point for additional research on websites which cater to the R community, including CRAN (""Comprehensive R Archive Network"").

Even given its near 700-page size, it is difficult for any book to cover R extensively, so I credit this book to continue to provide pointers in the right direction as I gain experience using the language. While ""R in Action"" in its introductory chapters gets one up and running with R more gracefully, chapter 1 (""Getting and Installing R"") and chapter 2 (""The R User Interface"") in this book also provide a glimpse into the many options available with regard to environments. The closest that one will get with a tutorial in this book is the 18-page chapter 3 (""A Short R Tutorial""), but this chapter should really only be considered a way to wet one's appetite with regard to basic operations, functions, variables, data structures, objects and classes, models and formulas, and charts and graphics, as chapters 5 through 10 go over these topics more extensively.

Chapter 11 (""Saving, Loading, and Editing Data"") along with Chapter 12 (""Preparing Data"") provide useful information on working with data, because, like it or not, as with any language most data work revolves around first getting it into the correct format, but although these chapters present more available options in this area than ""R in Action"", these chapters also again read more like an encyclopedia and do not provide any guidance, because as is the case with most of this text, readers are likely best served when they have a decent idea of what they are looking to accomplish.

Most of my use of this book has involved Part 4 (""Data Visualization""), Part 5 (""Statistics with R""), and Part 6 (""Additional Topics""). After experimenting with the packages included with R by default, it is Chapter 15 (""ggplot2"") which led me to purchase ""R Graphics Cookbook"", a well recommended book to learn the ggplot2 package, but it is the other chapters within this part of the book that made me realize that although the ggplot2 package provides standardization that is often lacking with R, no single package is likely to ever serve the needs of a developer, at least over time. Recommended text for those in the earlier stages of using the R language and environment and still finding their way, but not for the neophyte, as this book is not a tutorial, nor is it the encyclopedia one would expect from the ""In a Nutshell"" series.",10
Smartpage Books,1.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),"Not a ""Desktop Quick Reference"" like other Nutshell books","I bought this book based upon my experience with other O'Reilly ""in a nutshell"" books. The one on Linux is excellent. In other words, I am expecting an encyclopedic reference book. This book is much too tutorial in style to make a good reference book. But even so, I could deal with it if I could find the information I am looking for. The index is about 300% smaller than it should be, especially for a 700 page book. Lastly, towards the end the author includes an R Reference section - about 125 pages. However, commands, methods, et al do not contain any examples or do they reference the reader back into the text somewhere to see the syntax. It is this section that the author should have started with and expanded with syntax and short examples. Then it would indeed be a good reference book for R.",4

Graham H. Seibert,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introducing Epigenetics: A Graphic Guide,DNA defines an organism: epigenetics tells how to translate that code into a real live organism,"As the book explains, while DNA is the code that defines an organism, epigenetics provides the notes on how to translate the code into a real live organism.

The book is formatted for modern readers. It is short as Kindle books go – only 1385 locations. It is divided into chapters about one page each in length. I include the chapter index at the end of the review. It is rich in diagrams.

In writing such a book, the author must strike a balance between readability and completeness. She has to make some assumptions about the reader. This book appears to assume that the reader will be college educated, not flummoxed by the introduction of new technical terms, and somewhat familiar with genetics. In other words, it is not for everybody.

I am 50 years out of college but have read much of the popular literature on genetics, starting with Dawkins' Selfish Gene. I found that the book demanded my attention, forcing me to reread a few chapters in order to fully grasp the concepts, but in the end quite satisfying.

DNA, the blueprint for our bodies, is invariant. Every cell of the body contains the same long, complex DNA molecules. However, DNA always exists among other, supporting molecules, which do differ from cell to cell. These epigenetic assistants control how the information from the DNA is translated into building proteins for the various types of cells within the body.

DNA stands for diribonucleic acid – the double helix, half from the father, half from the mother. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, the more general form. Proteins are formed by what is called messenger RNA. These molecules are copied from short subsets of the whole DNA molecule. Messenger RNA tells the cell how to build the proteins required to be, for instance, a brain cell or a liver cell.

The structures surrounding DNA in a given cell includes markers that control which part of the DNA will be used as templates for building amino acids within the cell and which will be ignored. There are different structures for different cells.

As the chapter titles below indicate, a lot of things affect the epigenetic material surrounding DNA. Among these are aging and exposure to chemicals such as those in tobacco. While the DNA may not change within an individual, the body parts made according to that DNA model do change via epigenetics.

Epigenetic diagnoses for disease, and epigenetic-based cures for disease our already in place, and many more appear to be on the horizon. This book will be useful reading for investors interested in the next big things in biotechnology. It will help them read investment product prospectuses and annual reports from companies involved in esoteric new technologies.

The book is truly a five-star effort. The author deserves a great deal of credit for striking such a good balance among readability, completeness and bulk.

Solanum,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bioinformatics For Dummies,Good,"I am a couple years into a PhD in bioinformatics, but this is the book I started with. I knew some biology and some computer science, but I still found a lot of the databases, etc. confusing and the field has a decided lack of simplified documentation (though it is getting better).

Of course, bioinformatics is a pretty broad topic and no book could possibly cover everything.

If you do not know any biology at all you probably should also get a basic text on genetics/molecular biology (or read thema at the NCBI web site books section for free). You don't need anything in depth to read the dummies book, just at the level of an introductory biology book. Hint: DNA to RNA, RNA to Protein. And you want to know why proteins are similar because proteins with similar amino acid sequences often have similar chemical properties and therefore similar functions, so if you know what one protein does you can guess what a protein like it probably does.

MedIT,4.0 out of 5 stars,Think Python,Great start for the novice reader,"This book should be retitled ThinkPython: An Introduction to Scripting.

I would whole heartedly recommend this book to readers looking for a quick 0-60 self study in (Python) scripting. It's a great place to start for someone with really zero or next to zero experience who is looking to get up and running as quickly as possible. This book does not spend much/any time on computer science. It spends very little time on software design over and above splitting scripts into modules and basic OOP.

When my 13 year old cousin expressed some interest in programming I gave him this book without a second thought. For a high school class / intro college course for non(-committed) CS majors looking to cover the same ground in more detail I'd recommend Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science by Zelle. (These recommendations assume you are committed to Python if not look at How to Design Programs by F, F, F, & K)

Bottom Line: If you are looking to cultivate an interest before crushing it with big O notation or have zero interest in CS but want to automate something using Python this is a good starting place.

N.B. This book is freely available online.",43
DrewOJensen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Think Python,Not just for Python beginners,"Where was this book when I was taking college programming classes! I have to start off in saying that if you're a beginner in programming, this book is phenomenal. Allen explains the basics very clearly and thoroughly. I'd have to say this book is half about beginner programming and half on Python. As an FYI, this book is good for many basic principles of Python but if you're looking for anything more than just that, I'd recommend Learning Python, 5th Edition by Mark Lutz.

I bought this book for a new job that I took. I minored in CS and wish I would have had this book as my first programming book. I was attracted to it because I needed to learn Python (for work) and all of the guys use the Learning Python for reference. I figured why not start from the beginning and work my way there.

As far as the progression of the book, it moves pretty quickly. You have to stay on your toes with the examples. Having been exposed to a bit of Python before reading, I was able to keep up with the examples just in my head for a little while but as the book moved on, I was doing them in a console. I also think the flow of the book and how Allen moves from topic to topic keeps things cohesive quite well.

Overall, very well executed book and Allen assumes the reader has no experience in programming. Great book!

Update 1/20/14:
After finishing the book I wanted to write a follow up. I have to say that I stand by my initial review and rating! It has been a huge help in getting me up to speed. There are a few specific things that I would like to address.

In regards to the basic principles of Python, this book had done a very good job at balancing what you need to know vs what you can know. It was good to be reminded that this book is a beginner book. I ended up looking up more details and specifics of certain functions and methods mostly because I had specific requirements that I needed to perform with them. This can't be faulted on the author. As I had mentioned in my first review, if you're looking for more specifics, Learning Python, 5th Edition by Mark Lutz is a great tool. I've borrowed a coworkers copy and will be getting one of my own soon.

I cannot speak on behalf of the database content since I skipped over that section and have no experience doing database/structure.

Otherwise still very good book. I enjoyed being challenged as I read the examples and I like how it wasn't just a ""finish what I've shown you"" type of examples, but the author said, ""Ok, I showed you mostly how to do it this way, and you finished it in another example, now do it a completely different way with what we just discussed.""",5

TheLyingThief,1.0 out of 5 stars,Think Python,Absolutely unconscionable.,"Don't buy this book. The author requires the use of a 'swampy' module--whose code and comments, he explicitly states, are essential to penetrating any deeper into his book--that will NOT install. Google 'swampy' and you will find numerous complaints and confusions lodged at various websites about this issue. The author says that he will update his website if there are complaints about the installation, yet these complaints go back multiple years.

Mr. Downey, by failing to make this module useable, demonstrates just that arrogance I have come to expect of the computer programming tutorials out there. Obfuscate, poorly articulate, and then pocket the cash, irregardless. Usually, the same author follows up his poor showing with another, whenever a language revision permits, when the same well paid review writers will again bally-hoo the unsuspecting into a purchase.

This is a serious disregard in an author, and I am very surprised to find it overlooked by the O'Reilly publishing house, who are usually good in such matters.

stop buying crap like this, PLEASE.

Edi151,1.0 out of 5 stars,Think Python,Review of Think Python,"I recently bought this book. I caution others to consider the following points. It is a waste of time and a total disappointment because:

1. The print type is so small and so faint you quickly tire of straining to read the text.
2. It says it is for beginners yet it doesn't provide any guidance about the following:
a. Where do you down load the Python program from and where should you install it!
b. What is required for a 64 bit versus a 32 bit system? Does it matter?
c. How do you get started? What window do you open? How do you navigate to or load the Python Program in the unknown window?????

How can the promoters have the audacity to say it is a beginners book? In my view that is a completely fraudulent claim.

My only satisfaction was that I warmed my house with it by burning it in the fire place.",10
Rebecca L. Tagett,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Statistics and Data Analysis for Microarrays Using R and Bioconductor, Second Edition (Chapman & Hall/CRC Mathematical and Computational Biology)","thorough, rich, and readable","This book is extremely rich yet readable. It covers a lot of different topics, and chapters can be read in order or referred to as needed.
However, if you take the time to read it through carefully, you will enjoy yourself, because the author is a master of pedagogy, and often humorous.

While expression microarrays are the platforms covered by this book, most of the material has much broader application beyond that. Cell biology, R, statistics, experiment design, molecular pathways, and machine learning are all covered. Even if you don't work with microarrays, there is something in this book for you, anyway you should know the basics of microarray analysis.

Computer scientists or other non biologists may want to start at the beginning, which is an introduction to the cell and its basic mechanisms. It may seem like a lot of memorization and daunting to those who have never learned biology, but this chapter is well written with plenty of color images. It gives all of the fundamental biology needed to understand microarrays.

The author knows which topics need to be covered in more depth than other authors are generally willing to do. I especially appreciated the section on degrees of freedom. If you never really had a grasp on this topic (but used it anyway) you will be grateful for section 8.4!

Another chapter that I especially appreciated was ""Experiment Design"", which is so critical to any scientist of molecular biology and bioinformatics. How many of us in bioinformatics have been asked to analyze data from poorly designed experiments? Thanks to the extremely thorough preceding chapter on ANOVA, the chapter on experiment design is naturally set up for a straightforward and clear presentation of the rules, guidelines and concepts of experiment design. It presents the classic design models and several examples used by professionals in the field. The reader will feel confident designing basic experiments without having to refer the big hard core texts on the subject.

Throughout the book, very essential snippets of R code are revealed. You won't need much more or less than what you see here, once you have a little R under your belt. Dr Draghici's specialty is pathway analysis, and he is the coauthor of the R package ""SPIA"", available on bioconductor. The pros and cons of the different pathway analysis methods are discussed in detail.",8

The author is an excellent teacher who is skilled in transferring his in-depth knowledge to people unfamiliar with the material. The book is engaging and highly readable. In his short, but densely-packed chapter on GO-Terms, I learned more from him in a couple hours than I did from TAs in a 3-hour class augmented by many additional hours of my own independent searching on the web to ""fill in the gaps"". Fantastic book! Draghici highlights the gotchas and pitfalls researchers inadvertently run into and don't know it. I constantly read and re-read sections of his book which are relevant to corners of my current research where I wonder if there was something that I might have missed. It is amazing how many ""golden nuggets"" of non-obvious information packs into a readable and concise format. I feel like I have a second adviser in my Doctoral research.",2

Whether you need to learn basic biology or just need a refresher, this book will serve you well. Starting with basic biology, Draghici moves on to illuminate the basic issues confronting both Affymetrix and cDNA microarrays. The section on basic R programming is simple enough for a non-computer scientist to understand and yet moves rapidly enough to satisfy experienced programmers who will appreciate the commentary which helps to dispel some of the initial ""weirdness"" of R. I used this section to brush up on my R after being away for a while. Next the book covers statistics in a way that I found to be very readable. Many books will teach you statistics, but what sets this book apart from others is the way that it helps the reader to develop intuition about the statistics without sacrificing rigor. Later chapters focus on a variety of topics including machine learning / gene ontology / pathway analysis etc.

The color illustrations were an unexpected surprise in such a technical book and very useful in illuminating the material. In summary, this is a great book and a great price. You will want to keep it as a reference.",2

Ridahoan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids,a defining text for bioinformatics,"This is an old book now, and I don't know if its been supplanted, but when published it was by far the best book in its field. I think it still has much to offer. No, it's not an easy read for those of us coming from a biological background, but it is accessible, thorough, and self-contained, and a much gentler read than what one will confront in the literature. Unlike more theoretical treatments, this provides examples, and trots (if not walks) the reader through them, which is a huge step up for those texts assuming the reader has a strong mathematical background. It also builds on itself in explicit and thoughtful ways, so that the reader does not feel confronted with a jumble of different analytical techniques. For me it was an excellent introduction to methods of sequence analysis, and to some extent, probabilistic perspectives on modelling in general.",2
wiredweird,5.0 out of 5 stars,Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids,Brief and clear,"I keep coming back to this book for its readable, applicable summaries of basic algorithms.
One chapter covers the basics of dynamic programming for string matching: a staple of bioinformatics computing. The authors come back to it a number of times as they introduce new variations on the string-matching theme. They give about the clearest description of the Needleman-Wunsch and basic variants (including Smith-Waterman) of any book I know.
The bulk of the book is devoted to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), as one might have guessed in a book with Eddy as co-author. It covers the basics of model construction, motif finding, and various uses for decoding. Again, it covers all the basics so clearly you'll want to start coding as soon as you read it.
The later sections of the book cover phylogeny and tree building, along with the relationships to multiple alignment. Good, solid, clear writing prepares the reader for texts that may be more specialized, but possibly less transparent.
The next-to-last chapter, on RNA folding, is weaker than the ones before, in my opinion. It ties to the other chapters reasonably well in terms of algorithms, but I don't think it does justice to the thermodynamic models of RNA folding. If there is any weakness in this chapter, though, it does not detract from the strengths elsewhere.
The final chapter, the ""background on probability"", is the one that I think needs the most support. If you don't already understand its topics, I doubt that this will help very much. (If you do understand them, you won 't need the help.) There's nothing inherently tricky about probability, but individual distributions carry many assumptions, and I did not see those spelled out well.
This shouldn't be the only book in your bioinformatics library. If you really want algorithms, though, it's a good book to have in the collection and one you'll keep coming back to.",4
Chris Redford,5.0 out of 5 stars,Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids,Truly an Excellent Book,"I will agree and submit: this is an invaluable introduction to the field of bioinformatics. With introductions to everything from sequence analysis to hidden markov models and even a primer on grammars, this is a useful introduction both to biological applications for computer scientists *as well as* computational methods for biologists.

I am in a joint graduate-level biology/computer science class and we are using this book as a foundation to bring both groups up to speed and it seems to be working out nicely.

However, one criticism is that sometimes Durbin et al jump into subjects without an adequate introduction or with one that is overcomplexified. In other words, they sometimes break Einstein's the rule of ""make everything as simple as possible but not simpler"". Durbin et al do not always make things as simple as possible. And it is annoying when they do not. Especially when I see them confusing the bejebus out of the biology people over computer science concepts that are really not that complicated through overly technical jargon.

But this is rare and they provide many insightful diagrams to clear up their algorithms as well as lucid ways to introduce biological concepts. Sometimes the introduction of an algorithm/theory *and* a biological concept molds together beautifully such that the reader is simultaneously being infused with both. An example of this phenomenon is their dual introduction to CpG islands and markov models.",2
Bob Carpenter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids,Fantastic Descriptions of Probabilistic Sequence Algorithms,"I picked up this book at the recommendation of a number of colleagues in computational linguistics and speech processing as a way to find out what's going on in biological sequence analysis. I was hoping to learn about applications of the kinds of algorithms I know for handling speech and language, such as HMM decoding and context-free grammar parsing, to biological sequences. This book delivered, as recommended.
As the title implies, ""Biological Sequence Analysis"" focuses almost exlusively on sequence analysis. After a brief overview of statistics (more a reminder than an introduction), the first half of the book is devoted to alignment algorithms. These algorithms take pairs of sequences of bases making up DNA or sequences of amino acids making up proteins and provide optimal alignments of the sequences or of subsequences according to various statistical models of match likelihoods. Methods analyzed include edit distances with various substitution and gapping penalties (penalties for sections that don't match), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for alignment and also for classification against families, and finally, multiple sequence alignment, where alignment is generalized from pairs to sets of sequences. I found the section on building phylogenetic trees by means of hierarchical clustering to be the most fascinating section of the book (especially given its practical application to classifying wine varietals!). The remainder of the book is devoted to higher-order grammars such as context-free grammars, and their stochastic generalization. Stochastic context-free grammars are applied to the analysis of RNA secondary structure (folding). There is a good discussion of the CYK dynamic programming algorithm for non-deterministic context-free grammar parsing; an algorithm that is easily applied to finding the best parse in a probabilistic grammar. The presentations of the dynamic programming algorithms for HMM decoding, edit distance minimization, hierarchical clustering and context-free grammar parsing are as good as I've seen anywhere. They are precise, insightful, and informative without being overly subscripted. The illustrations provided are extremely helpful, including their positioning on pages where they're relevant.
This book is aimed at biologists trying to learn about algorithms, which is clear from the terse descriptions of the underlying biological problems. The technical details were so clear, though, that I was able to easily follow the algorithms even if I wasn't always sure about the genetic applications. After studying some introductions to genetics and coming back to this book, I was able to follow the application discussions much more easily. This book assumes the reader is familiar with algorithms and is comfortable manipulating a lot of statistics; a gentler introduction to exactly the same mathematics and algorithms can be found in Jurafsky and Martin's ""Speech and Language Processing"". For biologists who want to see how sequence statistics and algorithms applied to language, I would suggest Manning and Schuetze's ""Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing"". Although it is much more demanding computationally, more details on all of these algorithms, as well as some more background on the biology, along with some really nifty complexity analysis can be found in Dan Gusfield's ""Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences"".
In these days of fly-by-night copy-editing and typesetting, I really appreciate Cambridge University Press's elegant style and attention to detail. Durbin, Eddy, Krogh and Mitchison's ""Biological Sequence Analysis"" is as beautiful and readable as it is useful.",24

wiredweird,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Bioinformatics Algorithms (Computational Molecular Biology),Make this your first bioinfo book,"It's ironic that a new field like bioinformatics rarely offers any way for newcomers to feel welcome. Bioinformatics is maturing, and this book is that welcome.

It's written as a textbook for a Bioinformatics 101 course, the kind that has both computing and biology students in it. Historically, the two have lived in uneasy truce. The biologists thought that a 'database' was an enzyme that acted on 'datab'. The programmers would, in the authors' words, ""spontaneously abort"" at the chemistry and informality of biology. Maybe that's less true now, but the authors offer just enough computing basics for the biologists and just enough biology for the computer crowd to be able to discuss the same thing.

After that intro, the authors cover many of the classic problems in bioinformatics, including assembly, motif-finding, clustering, HMMs, dynamic programming, and even mass spec analysis. The style is very readable, and discusses both the biology and the computation of every topic presented. Many algorithms are built up in steps, showing how successive insights from both computation and biology can make existing techniques work better. Along the way, they offer biographical notes about the founders and luminaries of modern biological computation.

This is a great first book for anyone wanting to enter the field, from either a biology or a computer science background. Advanced students will bottom out quickly, and may lose patience with the informal and gently-paced discussion. Sorry, this book was never meant for them. It's a beginner's book, one that respects the intelligence and capability of its reader. It's broad, basic, and detailed enough that modest programming skill will yield working code.

Alex Blakemore,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning Tableau - How Data Visualization Brings Business Intelligence to Life,"Excellent, Teaches how to get the most out of Tableau, Clear, Readable, Covers introductory and advanced material","This is the book I wish existed when I first started using Tableau. Josh progressively covers the important concepts you need to understand to be effective with Tableau. He explains even the most subtle issues clearly and succinctly, explaining those critical details that make all the difference when you are trying to make Tableau do your bidding. You'll walk away knowing not just how to use Tableau better, but understanding much better why it behaves the way it does. That knowledge is essential if you want to get the most out of the application.

The book includes many tips and best practices that previously were only available on blogs and passed around informally between Tableau users. Armed with the info in this book, you will be in a great position to make effective, impactful visualizations from data in Tableau.

The writing is crisp and clear, and completely avoids being trapped into describing only step by step recipes on one hand or becoming a dry encyclopedia on the other. That's a hard line to walk, and the author handles the balance admirably. The book will be useful both for the brand new user who will get a quick understandable launch, and for more experienced Tableau users who will find plenty of great tips and explanations.

If I could recommend only one of the Tableau specific books available today, I'd definitely go with ""Learning Tableau"". If you can budget for a second companion Tableau book, spring for ""Communicating Data With Tableau"" by Ben Jones. The two complement each other well.",13

My goal is to learn Tableau so I know how to use it, not because I need it or because I use it for work. However, I don't own a license and can't justify the $1,000/yr price until I know I will need it. Therefore I was disappointed to learn that the first exercise, starting on page 2, can't be followed with the free public version because it doesn't seem to support Microsoft Access. Since the public version didn't work, I decided to activate a two week trial of the desktop version and unfortunately the option to perform the second step of the first exercise, ""Under Connect in the 'To a file' section, click on Microsoft Access', still can't be done. The ""Microsoft Access"" option, as in the public version, doesn't appear. So I then attempted to open chapter 1's workbook to see what would happen (which you download after purchasing the book - Chapter 01.twbx), and was surprised to receive the following: ""The 'CoffeeChain Query (Coffee Chain)' data source is not supported on Tableau Desktop on the Mac"".

The intro to the book, under the headline ""What you need for this book,"" clearly states, ""You will need a licensed or trial version of Tableau Desktop from Tableau Software. Tableau Public is also available as a free download from Tableau and may be used with many of the examples"".

Brian Hunt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Junk DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome,Excellent Presentation of a Complex Subject,"This is Nessa Carey’s second book and, like her first (The Epigenetics Revolution), it leads the reader into scientific territory that is unfamiliar: As far as I know, this is the first book for the non-specialist reader on Junk DNA. Also like her first book, it is a model for the careful presentation of complex details.

Junk DNA was originally defined as DNA that does not code for proteins (and this is the definition that Dr. Carey uses). According to that definition, 98% of human DNA is Junk and, indeed, was at one time thought to have no function. However, for some time, hints have been showing up in the scientific literature for the general reader that at least some Junk DNA is functional. In this book, Dr. Carey, presents a detailed account of what we know at present about the function of Junk DNA and its consequences. Most of her discussion is built around cases in which mutations in Junk DNA have occurred (or been inherited) resulting in severe medical conditions. She illustrates her often complex examples with simple analogies and helpful diagrams. I cannot say that I followed all of them the first time through but I am confident that, with more application on my part, I would be able to do so.

These are relatively early days in the field of Junk DNA: It is not yet known how much carries a function and how much does not. However, Dr. Carey’s book makes it clear that, although not coding for proteins, much of our Junk DNA does perform a large variety of complex and critically important functions. Indeed, it may be that it is responsible for the complexity of Homo sapiens and other contemporary species.",4

M. Spiller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,I've read it twice,"I'm not a Christian and I certainly don't believe in ""creation science"" which is often confused with intelligent design. I have spent my life studying science, and all of my degrees are in scientific and medical areas, but I've always been interested in spirituality. It's unfortunate that so many scientists are atheists. Perhaps they have no choice in the matter since they are generally wed to the very narrow perspectives of their scientific specialties. (Others, like Richard Dawkins, are wed to the industry of Atheism.) The Signature in the cell was the first book that I have read that explains in no uncertain terms why the genetic code would be impossible for nature to create by randomly combining primordial molecules. It is a technical book filled with technical facts and statistics that is so interesting that you forget that you are actually learning something. Although it doesn't talk about God or any form of religion or spiritual world, it is difficult to avoid the obvious conclusion that something outside of our material universe had something to do with the very first reproducing organism as well as multiple steps along the way to the evolution of the human species. (Myer himself does not draw any inferences about anything outside of the material universe. He simply draws the conclusion that an intelligent designer is the simplest, and for all practical purposes, the only explanation for the rise of life from a lifeless world.)

If you have studied quantum mechanics, you will have run into the inescapable conclusion that nothing really exists an a determinate state unless it is observed by a conscious observer. Furthermore, you probably have run into Bell's theorem which concludes that locality is something of a myth and that there is no logical connection between the reality we live in every day and quantum reality upon which our material world is based. The theory of quantum mechanics frankly states that consciousness is (and probably was) a primordial property of the universe.

The theory of intelligent design is based upon SCIENCE, and not on theology. It stands upon infinitely firmer ground than the Multiverse which is modern cosmology's latest mathematical/theological attempt to explain the anthropomorphic nature of our world of matter. Read this book if you really want to begin the journey to a rational understanding of how Spirit might actually have a place to live after all!

Nevertheless, I will offer my views, and when it comes to the quality of this book, the coherence of the arguments, and the monumental expertise in the sciences that is demonstrated, I give the book very high marks.

The arguments in favor of the need to postulate some form of intelligence as the progenitor of life on Earth seem to me quite convincing. Even with an awesomely vast universe, with much in the way of probabilistic resources, I believe that Dr. Meyer makes a very strong case for the view that some form of creative intelligence giving rise to life is certainly the best, if not the only reasonable, explanation for life as we encounter it here on Earth.

I believe that this book deserves to be in every university library, and that it belongs in many science and philosophy classrooms as required reading material. Dr. Meyer has certainly made belief in the existence of a creative Intelligence as the source of life in this universe and the progenitor of “laws of biology” not only more credible, but almost persuasively convincing. “Signature in the Cell” is an excellent book.",7

PGK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Excellent Evidence for Life's Chemistry,"This book has used a combination of the history of origin of life research, and the features of the basis for life’s chemistry. It is balanced and well laid out. It sweeps away the efforts used to create a chance explanation or physical necessity for the arousal of life’s chemistry. There is absolutely no evidence that chance or physical characteristics are capable of producing complex mechanisms either mechanical or in organic chemistry. Chance and random processes do not produce intelligent generated information storage and retrieval mechanisms. Why would that occur? Common sense and imagination are the tools of the science. Evolution is fraught with an agenda that seeks to destroy other explanations. I have only one comment to make to Stephen Meyer, A.E. Wilder-Smith was at the forefront of origin of life research. He had an influence on Dean Kenyon’s direction of research into the origin of DNA. He has stated that the influence of Wilder-Smith’s writing, and personal interaction helped to influence his thinking. Wilder-Smith has been unfairly labeled as a creationist by his opponents. He never even inferred such a stance. He argument and defense was strengthened by his encyclopedic knowledge of physical and organic chemistry. I learned an enormous amount about life’s chemistry from his writing. Wider-Smith's books that influenced my thinking are “The Natural Sciences Know Nothing of Evolution”, “The Creation Of Life: A Cybernetic Approach to Evolution”, and “The Scientific Alternative to Neo-Darwinian Evolutionary Theory: Information Sources & Structures” These books helped me understand these arguments before I read this book. So it would be It would be appropriate to pay some acknowledgement to Wilder-Smith's groundbreaking research and influence.

J. King,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Meyer offers best estimates in chapter 9 from which the quotes for ...,"What is the probability that life began by chance in a prebiotic soup? Stephen Meyer addresses this question in his book, The Signature in the Cell. Meyer offers best estimates in chapter 9 from which the quotes for this article are taken (page 212ff.).

Meyer shows that the origin of life happening by chance is mathematically unimaginable. Up to this point, chapter 9, he has been preparing us for the math. He discusses DNA and nucleic acid, amino acids and proteins, the history and philosophy of scientific research—a detailed description of the processes occurring in a living cell and how scientists reach their conclusions. Chapter 9 for me is the fulcrum of this work and a primary reason why it is subtitled: … Evidence for Intelligent Design.

Cells are complex living units with at least 250 functioning protein clusters. Proteins in the cell are made of a chain of amino acids—not any amino acids—but specific to the functionality the cell requires to be alive. There were 3 calculations that went into mathematically estimating the probability of life from the chance combining of amino acids into proteins. A simple 150 amino acid chain was used.
The probability that the amino acids will join or link up at all—peptide bonding(1×10^46);
The probability that they will join in the correct order—like words on a page to relay information in a readable sentence and not gibberish (1 x 10^74) ;

The probability that the correct amino acids will be joined—amino acids form isomers which are mirror images of themselves but only the left-handed amino acids (not the right-handed isomers) are functional in a living cell. (1×10^46).
“The odds of getting one functional protein from a prebiotic soup is no better than 1×10^164.” [1 x 10^46*46*74]

Meyer also argues for intelligent design (ID) as a science—an historical science, as was Darwin's approach previously for explaining natural selection as regards micro-evolution. Information theory, multiple hypothesis, causal adequacy.. a few new concepts that have come with the computer age. He uses Dembski;s filter to show that only ID provides a plausible explanation for the DNA enigma or the origin of life.

Honestly, to dat, I am convinced of his arguments. He uses down to earth illustrations to explain. A great read but a bit technical in places.

Some quotes:
The New-Darwinian mechanism faced what they called a ‘combinatorial problem’.
The odds of getting one functional protein from a prebiotic soup is no better than 1×10^164
The probability of producing the proteins necessary to build a minimally complex cell—or the genetic information necessary to produce those proteins—by chance is unimaginably small. (1×10^41,000)

In Meyer's words
For one hundred and fifty years many scientists have insisted that ""chance and necessity""—happenstance and law—jointly suffice to explain the origin of life on earth. We now find, however, that orthodox evolutionary thinking—with its reliance upon these twin pillars of materialistic thought has failed to explain the origin of life of the central feature of living things: information.",10
Amazon Consumer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Addresses Far More Objections Than I Anticipated; More Careful Than Proto-ID Theorists; Need to Read Before Judging,"I read this being a bit skeptical about the movement etc., alongside his other book and Collins' ""Language of God,"" but found it to address all of the objections typically lodged against the concepts (the predictive experimental power of ID is particularly intriguing), and if nothing else, a very well-written, self-critical piece of work. It really amazed me just how much critics and onlookers confuse with ""ID""; they tend to think the title (which is somewhat lousy, contrary to what some think) explains what they think it does, and it simply does not. Meyer is also far more careful with words and arguments than Dembski and the earlier ID crew, and should not be conflated as merely touting the same ideologies. At least that appears to be the case.

To zoom out for a moment, the unspoken rule that Meyer breaks is not simply critiquing Neo-Darwinism or uncovering materialistic naturalism, but showing that the disciplines are not as fixed and compartmentalized as Modern education would have it to be. That's the ""game changer"" in my opinion; can intelligence (of any kind) be ""scientifically detectable""? He says, yes, while others either say ""no"" (BioLogos) or ""we shouldn't try to answer that"" (academy). Modern epistemology is being questioned as much as atheistic materialism, and for that reason alone the specialists cannot continue pretending as if knowledge is unrelated and easily crosses boundaries, and have to deal with what is presented here.",5

Mark Me,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Your Genome IS God's Signature!,"DNA and a Living Cell Prove that God Exists:

DNA is God's signature. A fully programmed and fully functional Genome is God's greatest creation!

Every cell within your own human body contains God's signature. God Himself is written all over you and all through you. If it were not so, then you would not exist. You have God to thank for the existence of your DNA and your genome. If there were no God, then there would be no DNA and no genomes.

DNA is scientific proof of God's existence.

I was a computer programmer for a decade. The thing I learned is that programming languages do not design themselves or create themselves. The computers, upon which programming languages are compiled and run, do not design themselves, program themselves, or build themselves. Elegant programming code does NOT write itself! Even the artificial intelligences that have been designed and programmed to write their own code had to have been programmed in the first place; and, the AI's also have to have hardware designed for them to run on, which they can't initially create for themselves either.

The simplest living cell is infinitely more complex and required a lot more design, engineering, and programming than even our most sophisticated super computers. A functional super computer will NEVER put itself together through random processes!

If God put together and programmed the first living cell through random processes, it is simply the greatest miracle that God has ever performed, and He would have had to have been infinitely patient in order to wait for the job to get done! If God was waiting for the first living cell to put itself together through random processes, how many different universes did God have to build and wait through before He finally created a universe that had what it took to create life randomly? The odds of life building itself randomly are so improbable as to be literally impossible. It just can't be done. The scientists have run the math and calculated the probabilities and they know for a fact that life, even the most simplest life form, cannot create itself and program itself through random chance.

DNA is the most sophisticated computer hardware and software language in the universe. A genome, any kind of genome, is the most sophisticated computer code or computer program ever written. These things don't design themselves, build themselves, and program themselves. These kinds of things require a Designer, an Engineer, and a Programmer to get them going in the first place.

This reality is so obvious and so clear that your Skeptic and Atheist friends aren't going to be able to see it or understand it, because they aren't looking for it and aren't ready to receive it yet. They don't want this to be true! This is a classic example of God hiding in plain sight where nobody can see Him. The only ones who can see Him are those who are looking for Him! The Skeptic or Atheist, in contrast, is going to talk himself out of it, because he wants to talk himself out of it and into some kind of miraculous impossibility like macro-evolution or spontaneous generation or creation ex nihilo.

You are not going to be able to see this or understand it or accept it until after you actually go looking for it and want to find it. Darwinists and Skeptics and Atheists have programmed themselves not to look at this reality, not to see it, and not to understand it. To do so would prove to them that God exists. And, they can't have that!

Seek and ye shall find. Knock and it shall be opened unto you.

There is a 1000-volume encyclopedia inside each one of your cells. That is a boat-load of information! And, everyone instinctively knows that encyclopedias do NOT write themselves.

Your Genome is God's signature!

God Himself has signed each and every cell in your human body!

Think on that for awhile!",3

I found chapter 18 titled, ""But Is It Science,"" noteworthy especially the page 401 where there is several definitions of science. The idea of intelligent design being independent and separate of a religious creator also interesting and noteworthy. I have read many books on evolution and books that counter evolution and this was one of the books I would definitely recommend.",4

Sacto_Dave,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Myer's Book Will Make You Think,"Even with a BS in biology I found this a challenging read. Critics of Stephen Meyer call him non-scientific. I don't believe anyone who has read this book could honestly say it isn't scientific. One of my favorite subjects in college was genetics. At the time, in the mid-70's many of the concepts Meyer discusses weren't even known. I was fortunate to be able to attend a lecture by Dr Watson at the time. He being a hero of mine, I felt honored to be in the same room with him. I wonder what he would think of Stephen Myers' book. Even if you're a hard core neo-Darwinist, you owe it to yourself to read this. It's to creationism in the sense of religion. It's real science and will make you think.",9

But this book created a curiosity that I want to read more about ""ID"" and I have purchased another of Meyer's book, ""Darwin's Doubt"". And I have begun reading sample of Darwin's Black Box by Behe. As I have read more on the ""ID"" subjects, I read the same scientific terminologies and becoming more familiar with it.",2
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A Scientific Breakthrough,"Stephen Meyer provides the strongest evidence I've heard challenging (maybe disproving) origin of life through spontaneous combining of materials. He does very well breaking down and articulating the challenges/impossibilities posed to many current and past theories about the origin of life in the Darwinian sense. All the evidence he uses is in the context of information (which he goes to great pains to define) contained in the cell- specifically in DNA.

Stepehen writes the book for those who already have a rough idea for how the DNA process works. If you're not already a trained biologist I would suggest 1st familiarizing yourself with how the DNA process works prior to reading the book. It wouldn't take much- youtube if full of videos demonstrating this process. Watch an hour or 2 of these and you'll have a good enough base to follow Meyer's arguments.",5

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Dismantling Darwin,"Meyer's delivers an exceptionally succinct and thought out explanation for the DNA enigma. As he courses his way through the history of Evolutionary Biology, he provides scientific evidence from proponents of Neo-Darwinian Evolution that have come to the same conclusion as his own peers-the highly complex systems necessary in the simplest cell could not have arisen by chance in our universe under any conditions due to a plethora of computational, chemical, and environmental constraints in the alloted time since the Big Bang. The author doesn't cherry pick facts to support his agenda, he thoughtfully and analytically reveals all sides of the issue and dismantles it piece by piece-often in the voice of the scientists who realized that their ideas of evolution would never work. Skeptics will say these are the rabblings of a creationist, but I would disagree. For those of you hammering the 1 star reviews, take a deep breath and give it a chance. For further elucidation on this amazing story, I recommend his other read, Darwin's Doubt. There is so much that our young generation of students are being taught that is just not true.",10

Additionally, if you are interested in the debate over ""Intelligent Design"" this is a must-read. It seems to me that many of the negative reviews are from the same folks who give bad reviews to every book that implies or states that there is a God. I don't think that most of the 1-star reviews actually read the book.

Roger Wink,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,"Explain the origin of the ""DNA Program"", Elmo!","A wonderful Brain-Candy book!
How does Program code ""evolve""? Does your ""Hello World"" program replicate itself into a better and better copy if it has loads of syntax errors in it from the start? Or is it Magically perfect and correct the first time? Perfect the first time, you say... OK then how about the code/genes to produce the FOUR separate ENZYMES NECESSARY for perfect replication to work?? Helicase, Primase, Polymerase, and Ligase? Altogether millions of nucleotide ""lines of code"". One wrong code in that ""perfect program"" and one of the four enzymes does NOT function=dead-meat
So where did the ""program information"" in DNA come from?
Sure, you can hop on the evolution train for most everything that came AFTER the FIRST perfectly programmed, perfectly replicating cell was here... but that simply begs the question of How did the First Perfect Replicating cell come about?
This book is a fantastic read. I now could care less about contemplating or discussing evolution... it is NOT the interesting thing to discuss anymore.

I am a novice in this field but reading his material inspires me to learn more...inspires me to learn more. His candid, honest and direct rebuttal of his critics is professionally stated with reason, facts and common sense. Much like G K Chereston, the apostle of common sense, Dr Meyers draws heavily upon common sense enlightened with accurate knowledge and direct reason to establish his premise of this book and does not deviate from that premise. He reinforces it with every chapter and remarks several times that to understand ""first things"" one must use abductive reasoning just like CSI investigators, historians and geologists do, daily. Common sense. Great read",3

keisha colson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Five stars,"A simply amazing book, for the level of complexity of the topics Meyer presents, they come across very clearly, even to the lay reader. For that same reason, readers more familiar with what is going on in the science world, or who are scientists themselves, may get impatient with Meyer's style of repeating his concepts many times; however, I think this adds something to to the book, too—Meyer is absolutely thorough and relentless in his approach to this topic, and all his arguments are not only powerful in terms of their striking common-sense logic, but also couched in meticulous research of actual scientific discoveries and methods of science itself. And we also have to consider one portion of the audience Meyer hopes to reach—many times the critiques of Meyer's ideas fail to address the points being made, or actually seem to misunderstand the arguments he is making entirely, and so by way of response Meyer patiently states his arguments over and over in a multitude of different ways, crossing a wide variety of scientific disciplines, in hopes that his arguments will be, if not accepted, then at least understood as they are in the context of today's science.",2

Myer addresses this common accusation thoroughly in chapter 18 and gives a long laundry list of ID predictions in Appendix A that have been made over the years, which have been proven to be true.

The book is indeed long and at times hard to get through but Meyer's thoroughness leaves little room for critics of ID to lob an argument so they get on places like this to give it a poor rating without having even read the book. PATHETIC AND LAME!",3

Written in a way that makes the merits and challenges of the the theory plain to the layman, this is an honest perspective on what we do know and what we don't know when it comes to questions of origin.

Life's origin, as well as its perpetuation and evolution requires vast amounts of information that's stored within our DNA and any theory that would seek to answer the question of origin must account for the presence of this genetic information. The more we learn, the more astounded at the complexity of the information we become.

Meyer reveals just how much of modern evolutionary theory is based on assumptions. Given our increased understanding of science at the molecular and genetic level, Darwinian evolution deserves serious reconsideration. Dr. Meyer demonstrates clearly why Intelligent Designs deserves place as a theory in modern science.

ID definitely seems to be the most causally adequate hypothesis for explaining the origin of complex specified information.

ID is like the adoptee at a family reunion. The militant atheists whose religion is science will never accept ID as scientific, while those in organized religion (rightfully) see how ID accepts many of the concepts within Darwinian evolution and it is inconsistent with young earth creationism.

Anyone with an open mind and an ability to follow rigorous reasoning will read this book and conclude that evolution may explain how life forms change but it cannot satisfactorily explain HOW LIFE BEGAN. They will see not that this book proves an intelligence did initiate life, but that it makes a difficult to refute case that the BEST EXPLANATION for the information necessary to initiate life was the product of some intelligence, some ""mind"".

One cannot help but suspect that Stephen Meyer and his contemporaries will be remembered as the heralds of the end of the age of Darwinian evolution as the explanation for life on Earth. Even those who reject intelligent design will eventually need to answer these problems with something new. A good read to get an introduction into this area that will surely be an important chapter in the history of science.",3

Random mutation, by definition, assumes genetic information that is mutable -- whether in RNA, DNA, or proteins -- and natural selection does not function in an abiotic or prebiotic context, because there is nothing to select for, there is no variable genetic information that might translate into a reproductive advantage.",3

Dr. Meyer proved to me one thing for sure, such a dismissal is unfair and his arguments deserve to be considered and vetted as a viable alternative to traditional neo-Darwinism. I am guessing Darwin himself was dismissed out-of- hand at the time of his publishing. I would also recommend interested people to read On the Origin of Species - I just re-read it after 20-years, and although it does not benefit from 150 years of research, it is a great book nonetheless.

Lon Solomon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,"might not be proven (or at least established as the best explanation) without his ""origin"" arguments","Powerful companion volume to the works by Behe and Dempsky. My only misgiving regarding Meyer's book relates to his and its implied position regarding I.D. arguments post-life's origin. He does cite Behe and Dempsky, but at the same time gives me the impression that I.D. might not be proven (or at least established as the best explanation) without his ""origin"" arguments.
He seems to have read Behe's first work (Darwin's Black Box) but doesn't acknowledge Behe's second book (The Edge of Evolution). Yet Meyer's ""Signature"" book was published after 2007 when Behe's second work appeared in print. Moreover, and somewhat ironically, in a number of passages Meyer mimics Behe's arguments, although giving them his own twist.
From my perspective, even without exposing the contradictions implied by establishment science's attempts to explain life's origin, I.D. is very strongly upheld by Behe, Dempsky, et al despite their focus on ongoing evolution. I am particularly familiar with and inspired by Michael Behe's works, which IMHO firmly establish I.D., simply by demonstrating that those myriad ""just so, just in time"" mutations could not have happened fortuitously, as millions of serendipities (to use Behe's word for such highly unlikely so-called random events).
IN Behe's 2nd book he, like Meyer, does delve into life's origins, at least in terms of the cosmic conditions required for any evolutionary scenario to occur.
All this is not to in any way imply a lack of appreciation for Meyer's ""Signature"" work. I found it inspiring and feel it surely enhances (or completes the picture) earlier I.D. proposals.",1

In the end though the command of science that Stephen Meyer brings to this topic is hard to argue with.

Zachary,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,The Definitive Guide to Intelligent Design Theory,"Stephen Meyer has done the scientific community and the general public an invaluable service in providing a well-written, forceful and positive case for Intelligent Design from the perspective of genetic information. Unlike other classic ID arguments such as ""Irreducible Complexity"", Meyer sidesteps the mechanics and instead strikes directly at the key questions facing biological origin research - what is biological information, and where did it come from?

Meyer's writing is clear, precise and easy to follow. Make no mistake, this is a technical topic and not a quick read. However Meyer strikes a good balance between technical thoroughness and approachability, partially by including copious footnotes for scientifically inclined readers who wish to dig deeper. More importantly, Meyer argues the positive case for ID energetically and demonstrates beyond any rational doubt that ID is at the very least a powerful and productive paradigm, raising new and exciting questions about the fields of microbiology and genetic information that are fastidiously ignored by the Neodarwinian establishment.

In short, whatever your position may be on the ID movement, Signature in the Cell is an absolute must read for anyone who wishes to truly understand the debate. Frankly, the most disappointing aspect of Signature is the utter failure of its opponents to mount a rational counterargument, resorting freely to name-calling, condescension and beating down hordes of straw-men. I eagerly await a logical, scientific rebuttal to Meyer's proposition, and may the best explanation for the ultimate origin of biological information, win.",6

FlashHack,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,The Anti-Dawkins,"I just finished reading this. Six months ago I read Richard Dawkins', The Greatest Show on Earth. Stephen C. Meyer not only comes across as more ""scientific"", reasoned and logical than Dawkins, he is infinitely more humble and rational. Instead of verbally jumping up and down with clenched fists while spewing invectives, Meyer calmly and carefully lays out each argument and addresses the competing origin of life theories with respect and grace. If Dawkins had spent as much time researching as he spent with his thesaurus he'd probably have written one of the endorsements on this book's cover.

This book could have easily been only a couple hundred pages. The reason it's over 500 with 50 pages of meticulous notes is both a testimony to the unreasonableness of Meyer's critics and tribute to how gently he tries to make his point.

Andrew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Exposing the Darwinian Religion,"As a software developer and ID proponent this book was a must read for me even though I was completely already aware of most of the arguments.
Stephen Meyer makes the excellent and irrefutable point that DNA is in fact a code, a code no less than the electrically based (as opposed to chemically based ACGT) binary 1's and 0's base 2 system we use to build hierarchical functional systems. In addition to Stephen Meyers excellent analysis I have my own personal thoughts. This code is not a mere construct of the mind but a reality. One simply has to look at the engineering reasons for why a base 2 system was selected as opposed to other options, and coincidentally DNA translates over into a base 2 system. This doesn't even touch subsequent evolution of all of life, but highly pertinent nevertheless. When we analyze the Darwinian mechanism we find that its simply incapable of doing anything truly constructive with that code, building hierarchical organization is absolutely out of the question as destructive mutations outnumber beneficial ones by several orders of magnitude. We are led to believe that destruction (garbage collection) overtime eventually leads us to higher order interdependent functionality, but even considering this mechanism and if it got to a point where some new sophisticated function were to be realized, the next incurred random mutation would quickly destroy that potential state that was on the ""queue"" (so to speak). The point is that at the core, random mutations (even coupled with Natural Selection which doesn't remove the random part from mutations themselves) alone is not sufficient for explaining the integrated functional complex specification embedded in all of life. I'm open to purely unguided and undirected natural processes, but until a reasonable mechanism is put forth on the table, one that is sufficient from an engineering point of view, one where the watchmaker is actually blind, I will have to conclude that Darwinism is dead. I may receive some responses regarding fossils and genetic similarity, to that I will respond in advance that ""correlation does not equal causation"".",3

Congratulations!",This book should be carefully read with an open mind. The author is well versed in the relevant science. Evolution theory has clearly a long way to go in explaining the information content of the living cell. The simple minded theory that genetic mutation and natural selection can account for the biological facts is clearly unconvincing to say the least. The whole system of genetic expression and control is mind boggling. It would appear that those in opposition to the ideas presented here have either not read this science or are opposed on metaphysical grounds. Meyer's presentation is masterful.,4
G. Kyle Essary,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A Former ID Skeptic?,"I've gone back and forth on whether or not I should review this book. Why? Because this is a topic where the rhetoric and shallow discourses can drive one insane. I tire of the endless screeds of ""Science has disproven God"" or ""My Bible proves your science wrong."" Both arguments show little actual knowledge of the fields they are arguing for and against. To be honest, I typically find myself in the camp of those who see no disconnect between theology and the findings of science (I just lost 33% of readers who are about to click that this review wasn't helpful). I'm an evangelical, informed in scientific theology by readings in Polkinghorne, McGrath, Peters and T.F. Torrance. Thus, intelligent design naturally rubs me the wrong way (there go another third of the readers).

Despite this, I highly respect the philosophical work of Douglas Groothuis, and decided to pick this book up solely on his recommendation. Furthermore, I started to question if there was something to the fact that Coyne, Dawkins, Myers, etc. usually resort to ad hominem (IDiots, pseudoscience, etc.) and handwaving instead of actually dealing with whatever case ID supporters were making (there go the final third...). This lack of critique, yet rather vehement rhetoric made me interested in what Meyer and the rest were actually saying that would cause such angered rhetoric.

After downloading the Kindle version, I can honestly say that I was surprised at the depth of philosophical insight, scientific knowledge and quality of writing. The tellings of some of the greater discoveries of the last century were entertaining and the personal recollections of discussions with some of the world's greatest philosophers and scientists were likewise interesting. If nothing else, the book should be recommended for the fact that it attempts to accurately portray its opponents, something that is rare in our culture and particularly rare in regards to this topic. Sure, Meyer has an agenda just like every other writer and shares his assessments throughout, yet in doing so, he shows respect and understanding of the opposing viewpoints.

Despite a wonderful stroll through the history of genetic research, and the current theories, I believe the book ultimately seeks to as the question, ""What is science?"" This is by no means a settled question, and even the most ardent opponents of intelligent design differ greatly in their answers. You may think you know the answers Meyer will offer before opening the book, but travel through the 600 or so pages and see if you are right. You may be surprised.

Am I convinced of the entirety of Meyer's thesis? Not necessarily, as I'll have to continue to think through the issues. I'm definitely more open to the idea of intelligent design than I was before reading the book. I particularly found the responses to critics helpful for assessing the quality of my personal issues with the movement. In the end, I was impressed with the quality of research and argument in this book and recommend it for those who are currently supportive or opposed to the intelligent design movement.

UPDATE: This is a reposted review. The review originally had nearly 250 positive feedback with only a few negative feedback and was the featured review on the book page.

Based on the explanations provided in this book around the structure of DNA and RNA as well as the processes of coding transcription, gene expression and protein manufacture, one cannot help but notice an exquisitely designed nano-CAD/CAM system. Wow!

Stephen, I'm not a big fan of chemistry (as I had my interest in the subject squashed by an angry nuclear chemist teaching freshman chemistry), however, you made this a very interesting read. Thank you! I learned a lot from you.

I guess it takes so-called scientists who have blindly embraced materialistic philosophy to look at a sophisticated design and say it is not designed. They have wasted 50+ years in trying to explain away intelligent agency.

Perhaps it is high time to turn this work over to the engineers, who recognize a great design when they see it, so we can actually get some work done :^)

I also took a look through many of the comments. I noticed that most of the 1-star ratings were from people who didn't read the book or didn't want to cloud their thinking with facts. How pathetic.

Though the book can be a challenge at times to read and understand, the reward is an intellectual and heart felt understnding of the reality of intellligent design and that without it, reproduction of life, all life forms, could not occur.

As I read the book, I thought Mr. Meyer must be Christian, but he presented his views without taking a side.

*A primitive living cell needs at least 250 distinct proteins to exist. That brings the probability to one out of 10exp41000 (yes, I counted correctly the zeros). That's a 1 followed by 41,000 zeros for 250 proteins to form by chance alone.

1) the title and subtitle sounded intriguing, and
2) the book looks daunting, and I was up for a challenge.

I commend the author for writing in a way that an interested non-scientist can understand.

Yes, it took me several weeks to finish it.
Yes, there are some technical terms and concepts that weren't familiar to me.
But the difficult things were explained in such a way that I could get a sense of the complexity involved. And most of the book was just plain captivating.

Through this book I came to realize that the origin of life is not merely a complexity puzzle (as in ""our world is so complex that there must be a designer""), but more importantly it is an information puzzle. We *know* where information comes from in every other area of life. Where did the information in every one of our cells come from?

Meyer's arguments are not god-of-the-gaps guesses from ignorance. Rather, the design inference Meyer defends in this book is an ""inference to the best explanation."" It is based on the best knowledge available today.

Chris L. Burton,3.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,"Bait and Switch: started off well, but then turns into a non-scientific case for mind-body dualism","This book leads off with a great time-line of the history of cellular biology, setting the stage for a pretty clear and sensible definition of the ""DNA Enigma"". Along the way, the author makes a case for why the functional complexity of the cell's information storage/processing system is just too vast to be the product of purely random processes, even over the course of billions of years. He demonstrates why recent theories of deterministic self-organization have also fallen short of the mark. He deals with RNA-first theories and computer simulations. In each of these areas he convincingly argues that there is a problem of Displacement, whereby a given theory fails to explain the origin of the full information content of the cell by shifting the burden to some other unexplained source. I found this all pretty engaging, and he had my full attention for these chapters.

Then he starts to make the case for Intelligent Design (ID). One of the author's main arguments for ID is based on Uniformitarianism, an assumption or methodology used in historical scientific inquiry where an understanding of the nature of causality in the present is extrapolated back into the past in order to discover the best explanation for historical events (e. g., geological events, like the formation of a volcano). He argues that our current understanding of computation and information theory can be applied in a similar way to the DNA Enigma. Thus, just as functional information is intentionally designed in the mind of a computer programmer during the creation of an operating system that runs on the physical hardware of a computer, information could have been intentionally designed into the information carrying hardware (DNA and RNA) of the cell. The author claims that this is the best scientific explanation for the source of the complex functional information in the cell, since all theories involving chance, random processes and/or self-direction have clearly been insufficient up to this point.

There is a significant and, to me, glaring omission in this application of uniformitarianism to the DNA Enigma. The problem is that the only intentional, intelligent minds that we find in the present are all implemented by biological systems. If the author wants to apply the principle of uniformitarianism to extrapolate the intentional design fact into the past, then he really should also extrapolate the fact that only biological organisms with large brains are known to have had intentional, intelligent design thoughts. There should be some evidence in the fossil record of intelligent organisms with large cognitive capacities, i. e., the presumed designers of the cell. There isn't. Furthermore, even if we set out to find such evidence in the fossil record, we would still have the problem of infinite regress, the fatal ""who designed the designer"" flaw.

Of course, this is not what the author wants us to believe. Rather, the author wants us to believe in a designer that is pure mind, i. e., one that is NOT implemented by biological processes in the physical world. For me, this is really where the pretense of being scientific goes out the window. When we observe the natural world around us it clear that in order for a mind to have an effect on the physical, natural world, that mind must be implemented by matter and energy, i. e., the stuff of the physical, natural world. The concept of a mind that isn't present in the natural world does not fit logically in a scientific theory of the natural world. This part of the book reminds me of the religiously motivated 16th-century Cartesian philosophy of mind-body dualism (where Decartes argues for the existence of the soul).

In short, I would say that this book is a clever and entertaining bait-and-switch, but definitely not science.",4

Many people, when hearing about ID, will immediately assume this is about religion. For some people it may be, but not for the author of this book. The author, Dr. Meyers, makes a scientific case for ID, using scientific reasoning and mathematics to show how Intelligent Design should be considered as at least one theory for the beginning of life.

The reader will soon learn the author does not believe Darwinian theory should not be considered as a valid theory, but rather Intelligent Design should be considered as a competing theory to evolution. It appears from this book Dr. Meyers believes that some parts of evolutionary theory are valid.

This book can be a tough read, as is it highly scientific, and as a person not trained in the sciences, was over my head in many areas. The author does use, however, many easy to understand analogies to explain his hypothesis.

For some people, this discussion of the origin of life is highly emotional. What you will find is the author, Dr. Meyers, is anything but emotional. He is a scientist and thinker. You will enjoy his thorough coverage of all the issues, pro and con, on the subject of life.",1

This shows you can't please everyone but Stephen Meyer strikes a good balance. I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a BS in Molecular Biology. I appreciate the time Stephen Meyer spends addressing DNA, RNA, Proteins, translation, and transcription. This is necessary for this book.

Scientists used to see life as a unique combination of matter and energy. Now, we have a third ingredient: information. How do we incorporate that into our understanding? Stephen Meyer does an excellent job in laying out a new way of evaluating a new kind of evidence and gives us a conclusion we can consider for ourselves. Even those who don't want to draw the God conclusion will be able to appreciate how Stephen Meyer clarifies the limits of chance and selection alone for providing the jump from non-life to life (abiogenesis). I'm not saying he has the last word. That would be silly. He draws from the scientific approaches used in the historical sciences such as geology and paleontology. He also draws from information theory using concepts such as Shannon information. He compares the information in a single small protein with the probabilistic resources of the universe to make it from the beginning of time and shows why it's improbable. That's just the beginning of complexity. Protein and DNA are not only more complex than the simplest protein, they have to work in a highly specific complementary manner to replicate. Some believe a multiverse provides the probabilistic resources but is this the best explanation?

Toward the end of the book Stephen Meyer does a good job refuting common arguments against intelligent design such as the argument from ignorance, the definition of science argument, etc. I highly recommend this book. My only complaint is there is a technical problem with Kindle edition in that the appendixes are not viewable.",8

Steve Dill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Meyers reveals the truth about the Theory of Evolution and the origin of life: We were designed!,"When people tell me that Intelligent Design cannot be taught in the science class, they base their objection on the tired, worn-out slogan, ""Intelligent Design is not testable."" So, I ask them this question: ""Which part of Intelligent Design is not testable, the Intelligence part or the Design part?""

If design cannot be tested, then we need to get rid of all the engineers and schools of engineering. Engineers are quite capable of testing for design. Engineering is the science of design.

If intelligence is not testable, then why do teachers and professors give their students examinations? Examinations test for intelligence. To avoid hypocrisy, all pro-evolution educators should assign grades to their students randomly, and then let natural selection weed out those who can't survive.

Dr. Meyer shows how the Theory of Intelligent Design provides a much better explanation for the origin of the universe and the origin of life. Intelligent Design meets the requirements of true science. What ISN'T scientific is the Theory of Evolution. The Theory of Evolution (non-directed version) says that we were caused by randomness. Unfortunately for the Theory of Evolution, randomness is not scientifically testable. Just because one cannot detect intelligence in a system, it does not prove there is no intelligence in the system. Ask any cryptologist about this! Evolutionary biologists have a long history of making that mistake. At one time they believed the thyroid glands, the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus, the pineal body, the thymus, the tonsils, and the appendix were all useless vestiges of random evolution. They thought these structures had no designs and therefore, no functions. Their thoughts were based on ignorance and arrogance... the kind still found in evolutionary scientists today.

Dr. Meyers is a real scientist, and he uses real science to prove that it is impossible for life to have arisen without an intelligent designer!

This is an excellent book, and I would rate it higher than 5 stars out of 5 stars if Amazon's review system would allow it.

George Damoff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Have you read it?,"Several years ago I was visiting my daughter in Seattle, WA, when, while walking about the University of Washington campus, we noticed an announcement of a guest lecture by a ""friendly critic of Intelligent Design."" I'll never forget the moment when the friendly critic asked the hundreds in attendance who had a graduate degree in the natural sciences to raise - and keep raised - their hands. Most attendees did so. Then the guest lecturer asked those with raised hands to keep them raised if they had read Charles Darwin's ""Origin of Species"". Many went down. The lecturer said he was not surprised at the results of this poll. No doubt many in the room were (should have been!) red-faced Darwinists. I, too, have discovered over the years similar results when in lively discussions with adherents of Darwinism: they have not read his book!
Clearly there remain many critics of ID, friendly and unfriendly. If they have not read an ID book, I hope they have the integrity to refrain from writing and speaking publicly of their opposition. For those unread critics who desire to rectify their deficiency, ""Signature in the Cell"" is an excellent candidate. Meyer writes well and he has superbly organized an argument for a non-material origin for the vast amount of specified information in the cell. The early chapters weave together the history of the discovery of DNA's structure with the author's personal academic journey. In the latter chapters Meyer makes information theory and its corollary topics accessible for the uninitiated. Meyer does not merely settle for ID having an equal standing with other competing ideas for the origin of information in the cell, but he posits, with cogent argumentation, that ID is the head-and-shoulders-above best explanation.
Have you read ""Signature in the Cell""? If so, raise your hand, enter the conversation. If not, use your hand to open the book for an enjoyably written book that will challenge you to think about one of life's ultimate questions.",10
K. W. Lowery,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Meyer makes his case for Intelligent Design,"An excellent summary for the case for Intelligent Design (ID). Meyer answers critics who label ID as unscientific, citing Stephen Jay Gould, who described evolutionary biology, geology, paleontology, etc. as ""historical sciences."" Meyer explains how the theory of ID fits these parameters.

Clearly, the biological information contained in DNA is code-like, so much so that people like Dawkins and Crick have to remind scientists that it only ""appears"" that way. In his first premise, Meyer recounts a thorough history of the search for life's origin and how each theory has yielded no results on how the genetic code evolved. For his second premise, he demonstrates that the only known cause for the generation of information (specified complexity) is an intelligent agent. We look at cave paintings and chipped flint and scientists determine that some sort of intelligence produced this work. SETI searches the galaxies for patterns of information that designate intelligence. Every one of us creates information daily.

The conclusion of Meyer's argument is an inference that, as the only known cause of information, intelligence was the cause of the rise of DNA. This inference, incidentally, is the same logic used by Darwin himself (the observation of micro-evolution and the inference that chance and natural selection, stretched back over time, determined the origin of species).

One point I found interesting was the discussion of the predictions of evolution and ID concerning ""junk DNA."" ID predicts non-protein coding sequences should perform biological functions. It shouldn't be useless or junk. The model of natural selection predicts a genome ""riddled with useless information, mistakes, and broken genes."" Scientists have labeled this area between genes as junk (""gene deserts"") and proof against design, but research coming out of the ENCODE Project ([...]) are showing these parts of the genome are in fact highly functional. As Philip Kitcher said, ""Intelligent Design has deep roots in the history of cosmology, and in the earth and life sciences."" Kitcher's argument against ID is this supposed inability to explain ""junk DNA,"" yet clearly, ID can be a guiding principle and theory.

This is a book for those that truly want to understand the theory of intelligent design. There is a hard break that scientists use (methodological naturalism) which excludes anything supernatural from being considered as scientific. This book explains, step by step (sometimes a bit too slowly, perhaps), why ID is a viable theory that only invokes intelligence as a causal agent. There are, of course, theistic implications, but there are anti-religious implications from evolutionary theory as well. Meyer's approach, however, is completely evidence based. Meyer quotes Antony Flew, a long time atheist who now accepts ID, asserting, we must ""follow the evidence wherever it leads,"" regardless of the implications.",14

Other than that, it was an excellent book. I don't see how anyone could refute the idea that DNA is highly complex specified information and such information does not come about by natural phenomena except by the aid of an intelligent being. This concept is even used in science all the time, as described in the book. So to say ID isn't scientific just because it's ID doesn't hold up. This is science, and it will only be refuted with science. So if that's your goal, get working!",14

Larry Brian,4.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Comments from a real novice,"This is a fascinating book that deserves to be read even by those like me who know little of the field of biology science. Meyer has provided excellent background information by describing what living, reproducing cells are, and the information they contain. SITC is not a book for those who have a real problem understanding technical terms and actions, or for those who are put-off by opinions other than their own. I suspect many of the negative and uninformed comments and reviews have been made by 'experts' who do not have the stomach or the mind to deal with the implications of intelligent design. Other than the book title, and descriptions of how the implication relates to the cell and the information in the cell, Meyer leaves that research for other reading and thought. For me, as I consider not only where I came from, but also where the cells that make up the 'me' came from, this book has been extremely informative, and I thank Steven Meyer for the extraordinary effort he has put into research of the history of the science, and discussions of on-going research and findings; as well as for his language and illustration ability to bring this to my level of understanding. Additionally, Meyer has refrained from personally denigrating those who have converse opinions to his, or have attacked him for his opinion, a most commendable action on his part. SITC is a fascinating historical and current review of the opinions, research, experiments, and philosophy of the origin and development of the cell. I highly recommend reading this book, and following it up with further research on your own. While I purchased this book and read it on my Kindle, I now realize this is one of the books that should remain in my library for a long time and I might benefit greatly by being able to browse a paper printed edition.",7
S. Castlen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Kryptonite for Darwinists,"The practitioners of materialistic science have long portrayed their theories of the origin of life as invincible. Darwin of course, is their ""Superman"". No matter how many unanswered questions these theories leave, we are assured that the answer is out there, and the answer is naturalistic.

Stephen Meyer has now written the equivalent of ""kryptonite for Darwinists"". The mystery of the origin of life is identical to the mystery of the origin of biological information. Meyer documents the failure of Darwin's defenders to account for this feature of all living things. More importantly, he shows that only one cause we know of can produce large amounts of specified functional information; conscious intelligence.

The worst thing that could happen to the Evolutionary establishment is for the public to read this book. This is a game changer. Evolutionists need to explain the DNA enigma. If not, then maybe it's time to allow a real contender into the public arena.",16

John Phipps,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Common Sense Science and Eye Opener,"Mr. Meyer's thorough trip through the science at the DNA level and vigorous analysis is a convincing argument for Intelligent Design. I personally was interested in learning about the many theories and efforts to prove the complexity of life to be a function of pure chance and finding out how many scientists of all kinds, including those originally opposed to ID, who find their own theories far beyond the capabilities of pure chance to explain. Although he is a Christian, there is no attempt by the author to use ID as a foundation for his beliefs or as a tool to prove them. In fact, ID it's self is counter to literalist Christian beliefs. Meyer makes a complex, controversial subject interesting, informative and convincing. It opened my eyes.",8
android,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A Clear Step by Step Argument for Intelligent Design,"How good is this book? It is so good that naturalist scientists (those who think that there is only matter and energy, no god, etc.) avoid attacking the central premises. Instead they will call his arguments not scientific, misrepresent the arguments, claim he doesn't understand or misuses real science or call it creationism. As an agnostic, I found his arguments compelling. I await scientists to provide solid, on point counter arguments.

The time has come for scientists to stop telling vague stories to support their views. They also have a bad habit of pointing to something that is a step or two in the right direction and considering that as proof that they are correct. All of that was fine during Victorian times when the cell was considered to be a blob with a cell wall, protoplasm and a nucleus. Scientists need to update their theories to explain the amazing complexity in a single cell. We now know that cells have things similar to power stations, waste treatment facilities, hazmat transportation, regular transportation, guarded gates that will control what goes in and out of a cell and maintenance crews. All of this is run by molecular machines under the control of the nucleus. It is like a small city, except that it can also replicate.

There are other problems. It takes large specifically designed proteins (ribosomes) to read DNA and make proteins, but the ribosomes had to be built as well. It is a classic chicken and the egg problem. What came first DNA with no way to read and build proteins, or ribosomes with no DNA to read. Building and maintaining DNA also takes many proteins. How did life get started?

Scientists can make intelligent design and creationism go away tomorrow if they provide a detailed, plausible account of how things went from inorganic material to the simplest cell with all of the characteristics of living entities without a scientist intervening since that would be introducing intelligence into the process. Due to the extremely poor likelihood that life could happen by chance, scientists have suggested that there are an infinite number of universes and so any unlikely event will happen. This is a faith based argument since if word universe has the usual meaning, there is no way to prove the existence of other universes.

This book has pushed the debate to a crisis point. It is up to the opposition to provide an on point rebuttal. We know too much about the cell to be satisfied with vague stories. Proving that by random processes we can get simple building blocks of life isn't going to cut it anymore. We need the rest of the long, complicated story.

If a welder used the fact that he could weld two pieces of metal together to prove that he could build a 100 story sky scraper, you would need much more proof. Lets hold our scientists to the same standard.",5
G. Readore,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Excellent Book!,"Defintely highly recommend this book. Dr. Meyer provides well reasoned arguments and evidence for his position of the design seen in cell DNA. Those who are giving this one star or low reviews in mho are either athiests or hostile to the thought of something other than natural methods creating information seen in the DNA. Another reason is the theistic implications related to design seen in the cell. THis was the same with the Big Bang, but now scientists have to agree this is the best and most plausible cause for the universe despite its theistic implications. Based on our everyday observations the only cause for information we see is intelligence. Even the SETI program is looking for signs of this (i.e. intelligence). Why not the same for the DNA in the cell? Get the book, keep an open mind and I believe you have to agree with Dr. Meyer's evaluation.",7

We need more respected cases for design, and I think Meyer finally opened the door with this book. Only Michael Behe I would think is his superior on this specific subject.

I honestly don't ever trash evolution, and I think it's time Creationists and Evolutionists looked at each other with some respect, even if one knows the other is completely wrong.

Meyer does not deal with what happens after this initial process, so Darwinist who think that his arguments are against natural selection working on random mutations after the first self-replicating life system came about can rest assured that he doesn't. He just points out that NS working on RM cannot produce the first set of complex sequence specific information, a claim that neither Darwinism or Neo-Darwinism claims to explain anyway.

I agree with one reviwer that the auto-biographical style of the book is distracting at times, but the substance of the arguments are sound, closely reasoned, and well illustrated. Meyer's work represents a distinct constellation of historical/philosophical reasons why one should be suspicious of neo-Darwinian scientific claims; especially as these claims lead to, not scientific conclusions, but dogma.

Grimmy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A devastating dismantling of rope-a-dope evolutionism,"I just realized that my response to a negative review (by D.

The most interesting aspect is that dissecting their review suggests that they seem not to have read the book, but skimmed it. Or, read the book, but failed to understand its contents. (Brings to mind ""Dollhouse"" Topher's hilarious ""but it's cute that you're trying!"" Sorry.)

I also realized that many readers (or, more accurately, detractors who have not even read the book) are missing crucial information. As such I offer a short clip from Harvard/BioVisions' ""Inner Life of a Cell"", showing kinesin, a molecular machine, transporting cargo, something that happens in most? all? cells in your body. You see, intracellular cargo transport does not happen by chemical gradient or osmosis; it happens LIKE THIS. To some of you it is slowly dawning: this cannot have happened by chance. And now ...

Hello, David,

At first I thought yours was one of the more reasoned critiques mentioned by the other reviewer, David Marshall. Upon further reading, you seem to be advocating outdated theories to rebut Meyer, but I am open to seeing where I could be wrong. Sadly, I see a lot of ad hominem in these comments as well, which tell me more about the dearth of reasoned rebuttal than Meyer's arguments.

--On p. 143, Meyer tells us that ""The idea of design helped liberate Western science from such fact-free reasoning."" ""Such"" reasoning belonged to the Greeks that argued from first principles, and purely from logic, to the actual state of the world. Signature in the Cell almost immediately falls back into that error when Meyer argues purely from logic, analogy, and common sense instead of experiment and calculation. This abandonment of experiment is what most clearly justifies calling the book non-scientific, and even anti-scientific.

This critique is interesting because that is precisely the state of evolutionistic ""explanation"" that Behe and other ID-ers decry - there is no experiment, observation, or calculation, only vague pronouncements based on novel features ""appearing"", being ""conserved"", ""springing forth"", yin and yang, etc. The molecular level is where evolution had hoped to triumph. Instead, it has been dealt a serious body blow, as agnostic Denton shows from the data regarding developmental biology and sequence comparison.

Is Meyer arguing in the manner of the Greeks? Well, he starts with certain facts - the daunting complexity of DNA and its required transcription mechanisms. There are other facts, such as the (as yet) chemical barriers to chemical evolution of anything remotely resembling life. Since - contrary to your claim - decades of experiments and data show that chemistry does not favor chance formation of life molecules, nor has any other theory made experimental headway, logic gives us certain answers based upon experience. This is perfectly valid, as non-ID scientists such as Shapiro admit.

Elsewhere you write ""It might be an acceptible [sic.] debating technique to dodge your opponents best arguments until the time runs out, but that kind of rope-a-dope argumentation isn't science."" But that's par for the course in evolutionary ""explanations"" - I'm surprised you haven't noticed this phenomenon. The bulk of evolutionary ""explanation"" is ""we can't tell you how this happened in enough detail, but we're sure we will someday. Because we believe.""

--Polanyi's argument is central to many claims of ID, so lets talk about it a bit deeper.

But the argument is misstated. The problem is that since the bases can occur in any order and are not chemically ""forced"", the origin of the code cannot be explained naturalistically. Meyer does not accept this argument purely on the basis of logic but does in fact question Polanyi's conclusion, and goes on to detail the scientific findings that prove that the DNA sequence is in fact not determined by bonding affinities. It is THIS data that is indeed an obstacle ... for evolutionism. Now I'm wondering just how much of the book you actually read. If you did read it, you could have taken issue (well, at least in theory) with his assertion that there are ""no bonds at all"" to explain base ordering. Instead, you have filled your review with misinformation.

--There is a lot of evidence that this process is at least in part driven by the laws of physics and chemistry,

This claim is simply false. As any origin of life researcher knows, the laws of physics and chemistry actually work against chance formation of DNA or its precursors, because of chirality and cross-reactions, not to mention the degrading effect of the environment, such as UV, etc. I must assume you were simply unaware of the findings of the last couple of decades in this regard. If you had read the book, you would have been aware that Dean Kenyon repudiated his own book on biochemical predestination based on similar analysis.

--Starting from an assertion that we need 150 amino acids for functionality, and old and often refuted argument follows that the universe doesn't have the resources to find even one such protein.

You claim this has been ""refuted."" Again, this is misleading. More accurate to say it has been simply ""ignored."" You write [Meyer ignores all evidence that vastly smaller fragments of protein have useful function.] But how small? And to what end? You complain about lack of calculation, but you fail to specify what function a 15-length protein could perform and replicate, what experiments show this, and how perhaps a collection of such could eventually create a living cell. It's rope-a-dope.

--then use two of the best 15-length sequences together in a 30-length sequence. Etc, Etc. But Stephen Meyer is not going to tell you that.

But you are not going to tell anyone that it's much more complex than 2^15 ... why not? Because you have to factor in chirality (50%), peptide bonds (50%), wrong sequence (1 in 20 to make it easier). For the ridiculous 15-chain molecule, this gives us 1/20^15 x .25 = 7^-21, not 2^15.

You also didn't mention that Meyer actually addresses the scenario you mention when discussing Kauffman's theory. Is it because he informs us that 40 or 50 amino acids are required ""at a minimum""?

--As Dr Miller complained in 2000, Stephen Meyer lies by omission by ""not having the space"" to mention 20 years worth of research in the RNA World hypothesis. ...There is no mention of the work of Michael Yarus' lab, no mention of the stereochemical hypothesis in the origin of the genetic code.

Has Yarus' work showed us experimentally how the RNA world originated by chance? I must have missed it. Because he is stuck on Dawkins' flawed WEASEL argument. It's not encouraging that he hasn't realized that it instead argues FOR ID, since it's selecting for some purposeful goal. The situation hasn't changed much since Gerald Joyce debunked the RNA hypothesis, ""The most reasonable interpretation is that life did not start with RNA."" And this does not even address the fragility of chance formations of RNA. Unless Meyer's claim that ""the properties of biological building blocks do not determine the arrangement of monomers in functional DNA, RNA, or proteins"" has been superseded, I'm not sure what tossing in Yarus' name accomplishes, other than to imply something that is not true.

--It is picking and choosing, retelling lots of old stories, personal stories, and some basic science, while avoiding the experiments and evidence that would challenge ID, and collapse its claim to be the best explanation of anything in the universe larger than Stephen Meyer's paycheck. ID explains that perfectly well.

Ends on an ad hominem, and a completely vacuous claim. Isn't it strange that the only rigorous mathematical study of the odds of beneficial mutation done in decades is by an ID-er (Behe)? You are surely aware of this. Kevin McCarthy would be ashamed. I can see his critique now: ""Kannon has no formal training in biology or information theory. While I don't say that someone with no formal training could make a significant contribution to science, that person must make every effort to understand everything that has come before him. He must also make sure that every bit of information related to his topic is examined and incorporated or refuted. Kannon does none of this.""",36

Hansston,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Placing Intelligent Design right next to Darwinism for anyone to see,"I read “Signature in the Cell” by Stephen Meyer. What a fantastic journey through his mind as he shepherded the idea of making “intelligent design” an acceptable explanation for the origin of life in the scientific community. (This was the man who they talked about taking away his doctorate because he didn’t really believe the answers he had to put on tests in order to pass). It was this article that I read about a dean of philosophy, Thomas Nagel, who had been convinced to give up his Darwinian faith after reading Stephen’s book that got me to pick it up and read it.

The world has always been viewed through history by leading scientists and philosophers concluding “that behind the exquisite structures of the living world was a designing intelligence”. This all changed with Darwin. Natural selection and mutations would now become the explanations of how we came to be. The discovery of DNA by Watson and Crick would present a dilemma to the scientific world: what is the origin of the biological information in DNA?

Meyer gives us a history of evolutionist attempts to explain the origin of life. One section entitled “Oparin to the Rescue” tells of us a young Soviet scientist who proposes in 1922 that the chemical reactions taking place long ago were the original building blocks of life and afterwards Darwinian natural selection took over creating life. I love his Marxist motivations in seeing evolution as a proof of Marxist materialism. It was in 1953 that a experiment by Stanley Miller showed the possibility that lightning mixing with the prebiotic soup of the planet could create amino acids the building blocks of protein. This was a crown of glory for evolutionists searching for the origin of life. It was the other discovery in 1953 of DNA that would shake that crown off of their heads.

Meyer gives us a great description of the factory within the cell. The centerpiece is the DNA and its ability to produce and transmit the code to building proteins. This peek into the molecular world is well done, but it also explains the “chicken or the egg” problem of DNA. “The production of proteins requires DNA, but the production of DNA requires proteins”. The problem is bigger than that as Meyer explains: “The discovery of life’s information-processing systems…has made it clear that scientists investigating the origin of life must now explain the origin of at lest three key features of life. First, they must explain the origin of the system for storing and encoding digital information in the cell, DNA’s capacity to store digitally encoded information. Second, they must explain the origin of the large amount of specified complexity or functionally specified information in DNA. Third, they must explain the origin of the integrated complexity—the functional interdependence of parts—of the cell’s information-processing system.” He will spend 8 chapters looking into the various attempts to explain this information phenomenon. He is doing this with an eye upon what will become obvious: creating information requires intelligence.

Meyer is going to use his knowledge of “historical sciences” to put “intelligent design” right next to “Darwinian evolution”. The same reasoning that would allow one to stand or fall is the same reasoning that would allow the other to stand or fall as a potential explanation for the origin of life. This may seem unnecessary or too wordy; but in fact he is doing a beautiful job in making “intelligent design” a theory that cannot be dismissed. Charles Lyell and Charles Darwin both used “causes now in operation” to legitimize their theories. He is setting up the criteria for how “historical sciences” can be used by their determination of the “best” explanation for how something happened in the past. That sets the stage for his discussion of the many tributes to chance, necessity or a combination of the two that evolutionists use to explain the origin of life.

He will quote college textbooks that will enshrine in young minds “the chance association” that created life. One text says: “Given so much time, the impossible becomes possible, the possible probable and the probable virtually certain.” He will team up with William Demski’s knowledge of mathematical odds to show that it is impossible for chance to be the explanation of creating a string of functional arrangement of bases and amino acids. He will refer to Douglas Axe: “Axe has compared the odds of producing a functional protein sequence of modes (150-amino-acid) length at random to the odds of finding a single marked atom out of all the atoms in our galaxy via a blind and undirected search.” What I found interesting in this discussion is that by 1966 many mathematicians were shocked to find biologists so willing to hang their theories of the origin of life on chance alone. He described a conference entitled: “Mathematical Challenges to Neo-Darwinism”. That conference ended with the biologists insisting that as long as their was a single possibility that it might of happened in a “cosmic jackpot” moment they were not willing to let go of that possibility as their official explanation. Not a lot has changed since then.

He will deal with the ideas that DNA was a self organizing accident way back when. Even this accident if it could be shown to be chemically induced, cannot explain the intelligent data that the accident created. He refers to Michael Polanyi. “The flow of electricity obeys the laws of physics, but where the electricity flows in any particular machine depends upon the arrangement of its parts—which, in turn, depends on the design of an electrical engineer working according to engineering principles. And these engineering principles, Polanyi insisted, are distinct from the laws of physics and chemistry that they harness.” “The laws of acoustics and the properties of air do not determine which sounds are conveyed by speakers of natural languages. Neither do the chemical properties of ink determine the arrangements of letters on a printed page.” “Then he took a step that made his work directly relevant to the DNA enigma: he insisted that living things defy reduction to the laws of physics and chemistry because they also contain a system of communications—in particular, the DNA molecule and the whole gene-expression system…as with other systems of communication, the lower-level laws of physics and chemistry cannot explain the higher-level properties of DNA. DNA base sequencing cannot be explained by lower-level chemical laws or properties any more than the information in a newspaper headline can be explained by reference to the chemical properties of ink.”

He shares his thinking of Polanyi’s thoughts that led him to his own breakthrough on the idea that laws of attraction brought the four different amino acids together which would create the information that makes living things what they are. His final dismissal of the theories of attraction came from a simple view of a DNA diagram that he had seen many times before but now, with Polanyi thoughts in his head, he sees that “there are no differential bonding affinities there. Indeed, there is not just an absence of differing bonding affinities; there are no bonds at all between the critical information-bearing bases in DNA…A force has to exist before it can cause something. And the relevant kind of force in this case (differing chemical attractions between nucleotide bases) does not exist within the DNA molecule.” It is great having Meyer give us a step by step evolution of his thinking as he marshals his thoughts to give us a great explanation of what he considers to be the best explanation of the information coded in DNA: intelligent design.

The tone is always respectful as he describes the different ideas floated around. He does take the liberty of using a “Cat in the Hat” idea of the “voom”, something that cleans messes up as something that evolutionists are looking for so they do not have to deal with the explaining of origin of life information. He will go on to talk about “RNA world” where the RNA appears and creates the DNA. All worth reading, but I enjoyed his take on all of the computer simulations that are used to find ways of creating life. They all proved his point. They were only valid when the programmer set winning parameters or set targets for the chance to find. What all the programs had in common was the touch of “intelligent design” provided by the writers of the programs.

I will list his headings that describe “intelligent design” as the best explanation for the origin of life as exemplified by the information in DNA.
1. No Other Causally Adequate Explanations
2. Experimental Evidence Confirms Causal Adequacy of ID
3. ID is the Only Known Cause of Specified Information

That last point has been illustrated in the book with several descriptions of classroom exercises involving random letters and locking mechanisms. These personal touches of life experiences made the book so much more readable and personable to me. I already have been using his letter illustrations when I talk with kids at school about the book I am reading. I have read several books conveying this same information and have found each of them enlightening. Meyer has repeated the job they have done, but has not just refuted Darwinism as previous authors have done; he has carefully placed an alternative explanation, intelligent design, right next to Darwinism for everyone to compare. I cannot recommend this book too strongly!!!",2

Otherwise, Meyer has done a thorough job arguing his thesis from every angle. I've read comments from the naysayers, and they only nit pick minor issues, they fail to engage his main point.

This is one of those books that help drive another nail into Darwinian thought. The truth sets you free--no lie ever has or will. Science (Latin Scientia means facts:body of knowledge / information) Scientists are people who may not like what the facts (science) say--and use their platform of influence to distort reality / truth upon unsuspecting impressionable minds in high school and college.

Bob Fink,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Very scientific!,"Good scientific argument showing the superior explaining ability of the intelligent design hypothesis.

Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Solid argumentation,"Meyer does a good job of looking at the evidence and observing that it leads to a designer. He does not, as many have said, conclude a designer where the evidence does not show one. The opposing side seems to say that no matter what the evidence shows, it can't point to design....or if it does, it must be aliens who did the designing (see the panspermia theory proposed when the evidence for design seems too unavoidable). I hold degrees in biology and biochemistry and I felt he did the science justice. Many reviewers seem to assert that it is not science. Science is simply following the evidence where it leads. Science is not ""naturalism only"". The presence or absence of a designer has no effect on the methods of science, just on the evidence that is available for conclusions. Ruling out a designer at the start no matter what the evidence shows is not science.",23
Jared I.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A great book for those who are into Intelligent Design Theory,"This was a very good book, I especially recommend it to people who are into Intelligent Design Theory. The main complaint I have is that the author is a christian, and because of that I wonder if he has ulterior motives for writing this book. I think in the book he said that he does not. If I remember correctly, he successfully refutes Darwinism. And he refutes all theories concerning the origin of life based on chance and necessity. He is clearly a brilliant man, and while I understood most of the book, at times it was a little too deep and complicated for me. He defined Intelligent Design Theory as a ""rational, conscious agent in the Universe"". I do not agree with that. I do not think the Big Bang could create a fully conscious being by itself alone. I do reject Darwinism and Creationism. I believe that at the very least, there has to be a force in the Universe that created life and guides its evolution. If you are into Intelligent Design Theory, you should definitely check out this book. And if you are the kind of person who likes to hear different arguments on the nature of reality, again check out this book.",1
Seventh Degree,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Two must books to read...,"I majored in biology in college not that long after Watson and Crick described DNA. I then went on to study medicine and neurology and have always been fascinated with DNA because I realized as personal computers came forth in the 1980s that there was a connection. I was an early adopter of the PC and remain intrigued with every new ""toy"" to collect and analyze information. I recall reading a book about medicine and computers called Information and Medicine in the 80s as well. This book was about the differences between data and information in clinical settings but again what struck me was this notion of ""information"" that was entering the world of all sciences.

Now, as the digital world has advanced and miniaturized dramatically, as nanotechnology is part of our lexicon, as DNA is known more and more in great detail I see a return to the world when Newton lived where he and so many others believed that God had made the world ""intelligible"" and it was to humankind to find it out. Science and faith merging was a possibility then but the Enlightenment, where reason became dominant destroyed that merger.

Now, with Francis Collins' book (former head of the Genome Project and now NIH head), The Language of God, and Meyer's The Signature of the Cell, intelligent, curious and open-minded people can see the possibility of faith and reason finding common ground. What a better world we would live in if this could occur. I have loved the review of molecular genetics from Meyer and I am more convinced than ever that randomness is not the explanation for the DNA/RNA codes--only intelligence can create such elegant, complex and thoughtful information and direction that underlies our existence.",17
Christina Wilson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,"Signature in the Cell: an intellectually liberating, great book","Signature in the Cell by Dr. Stephen C. Meyer is a great book. Although Cambridge educated Dr. Meyer is a relatively young man, the book can be described as a life work.

In the book Dr. Meyer records chronologically his personal quest for the best
scientific explanation of the origin of life. His field of science is what he terms historical. He defines and describes this branch of science and identifies its principles of operation as being similar to the principles Darwin used in arriving at his conclusions.

As a scientific journey, Signature in the Cell presents Dr. Meyer's historical scientific search for the best explanation of the origin of life in an extremely comprehensive and in-depth fashion that can be followed and grasped by lay readers and scientists alike. The autobiographical elements make the otherwise technical text read like a ""whodunit?"" of molecular cellular biology.

Dr. Meyer is also an educator. A main educational strategy in any field is the repetition of the key principles being taught. Dr. Meyers makes free use of repetition for emphasis and understanding. He uses many analogies as springboards to illustrate scientific concepts, but he always teaches the scientific concepts that the analogies are designed to illustrate. He often refers to lessons and demonstrations he has used with his own students in real-life classroom settings. The use of repetition and large quantities of analogies help the reader to understand the often detailed scientific language of the book.

While there are many so-called scientists who may label Dr. Meyer's form of intelligent design as unscientific, apparently very few of them actually address the scientific arguments, logic, and facts that Dr. Meyer presents. I've read Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion, and there are no positive comparisons to be made between that book and Signature in the Cell.

While Dawkins insults, rants, raves, and asserts, Dr. Meyers explains, defines, illustrates, and uses painstakingly consistent logic to prove his points according to the strictest of pre-defined historical scientific principles. He leaves no stone of logical and scientific argument unturned. There is no scientific field of inquiry into the origins of biological life which he does not examine in great detail. Dr. Meyer is not afraid of truth. He follows truth where it leads.

While Dawkins' book is full of arrogant pomposity and emotional attacks, the lowest Dr. Meyer stoops in Signature in the Cell is to quote a mild but very witty You-Tube video that pokes fun at Dawkins.

Dr. Meyer is an extremely intelligent writer well educated in science at some of the best institutions of higher learning in the world. Here we have his life work in print, faultlessly logical and thorough in its scientific approach, able to be read and appreciated by both scientists and lay people. His topic is not evolution, but the origin of life on earth. He makes an extremely strong case that the best explanation for the origin of life is intelligent design, not random, chance mutation acted upon by undirected natural selection.

In great, almost painstaking detail, he shows time and time again from multiple points of view why the purely materialistic theories fall short in explaining the origin of the extremely complex bio-molecular information that even the simplest of self-replicating organisms require. Then, positively, based on scientific observation and reasoning he shows exactly how and why intelligent design provides the best explanation of life's origin.

Anyone who has ever felt intimidated by the published attacks and bashing of so-called scientists who define science as only that which produces conclusions that agree with their own should find Dr. Meyer's book absolutely refreshing. Here is a scientific work by an intellectual giant who uses the same methods and definitions which the materialistic-only scientists themselves use, but with far different results.

It's time for the public to quit allowing themselves to be pushed around. If there is a good book out there written by an outstanding author, then read it! Who cares if so-and-so of such-and-such a science institute is afraid to read such a book and answer it point for point on its own terms? Dr. Meyer's book Signature in the Cell is a great book. It's very enjoyable. I highly recommend it.",17

Geoff Puterbaugh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,An excellent overview,"I just finished reading Simon Singh's excellent book, ""Big Bang,"" which provides a fascinating historical overview of cosmology in its entirety, not just the Big Bang.

Stephen Meyer's book does the same for the entire question of ""the origin of life."" Just as Singh takes the history of cosmology back to Pythagoras, Meyer takes the question of the origin of life back to its beginnings, when there were basically two sides to the debate. One side believed that thought, or intelligence, was the cause of everything, including the physical universe, while the other side thought that everything could be understood and explained in terms of matter alone. We might call these ""idealists"" and ""materialists,"" as long as we don't confuse THESE idealists with the ""idealists"" of the Victorian era, silly philosophers who pretended to believe that the only reality lay within the mind, and pretended to doubt the reality of the physical world. (David Stove describes these silly people in Against the Idols of the Age, a fascinating and exhilarating read.)

The history moves forward, and eventually arrives at Darwin, who explained his theory of evolution but had absolutely no idea of the origin of life. Darwin took life as a given, and explained how living creatures could morph around. The scientists of the time were extremely casual about the origin of life itself, because they had convinced themselves that the question was a no-brainer. What's inside a cell? Protoplasm, of course: some sort of biological soup that anyone could cook up in a minute or two. Nothing special. (This is one of many scientific howlers we encounter along the historical road.)

Things get much more interesting when we arrive at 1953, and the discovery of the structure of DNA. The history gets even more interesting at this point, although it also seems clear that there are still two camps who do not see eye-to-eye: those who hold to the ""Logos"" doctrine and think that intelligence is the underlying reality of the universe, and the materialists who think that it's all a question of colliding molecules and good luck.

I recommend this book very highly, and you can skim over a lot of the painful detail provided by the author. That is, instead of writing something like, ""DNA contains the instructions for building proteins, which are built by RNA and other helpers,"" he will provide you with 2-3 pages of the bloody details. It's nice to have the details, but you can skim over them.",8
Edward P. O'Brien,4.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A view from Orthodoxy,"I come a different way of thinking, namely Orthodoxy. The book by Meyer is very concise and formidable. His data seems to be correct. These things have been all consumming to the western mind since Thomas Aquinas and his sumas. In Orthodoxy the sumas and the so called enlightenment did not happen. Instead in orthodoxy we have attended the first Christians and the church Fathers. I have read every word in Meyer's book and objectively think he did as well as one can in trying to tie the infinite to the finite. One matter that all seem to overlook is that looking for an infinite conclusion, we are limited by our finitude. To think we could reach up to the infinite God is wrongheadedness. The only way according to orthodoxy for man to reach God was for him to come down to us. He did this in the form of a slave and was beat,suffered and was buried. He rose again on the third day. He came back until pentecost and about 500 were converted the next day. To learn orthodox theology, one must look to the original church. Of the original five churches we can identify, only Rome was in the west. One must look beyond the west to learn about Apostolic Christianity.

Larry Turner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,One of the Best Write-ups yet explaining Creation Science! Buy it!,"I read through this book and really enjoyed the ""in depth"" explanations supporting Intelligent Design. While everything we see in our schools and on tv seem to have no explaination for the complexity of life we see in the cell enviroment; especially the complexity of DNA, which while microscopic in size, contains over 1 gigabyte of information in every strand, and to make it even more amazing, a copy is contained in every cell in our bodies!

This book uses practical examples and explainations and brings them to life for the average reader as well as those wanting to know more about cell biology.. This is a ""Must Read!"" book that should be taught in all our schools as an alternative theory to the theory of evolution that is currently being taught without any challenge.

Here are some things I know: Real science is impartial. Real science looks at the evidence at hand and analyses the evidence and presents it for consideration without wondering ""could this be intelligent design or chance?"" If both theories are possible, then both are presented. Real science is not currently allowed to be taught in our schools.

The complex coding required to make proteins that is contained in the DNA libraries is found in every cell in our bodies. Proteins must go through very complex and very specific folding technics and fit together with other proteins like a key and lock in order to be perform their function. This type of interaction could NEVER happen by chance.

J. Alex,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Rock solid case for design!,"Wow! This is by far the strongest case I have seen for intelligent design. Dr. Meyer lays out a rock solid argument based on the specified complexity found in DNA. The book is filled with easy to follow analogies to help explain the scientifically complex reasoning behind ID theory, and there is an overall structure and story to the book, so it is entertaining as well as educational.

As for the opposition and controversy surrounding the Intelligent Design Theory-and there is plenty-Dr. Meyer addresses most if not all of the current dissent over the origin of life as well as the alternative theories and their shortfalls. He does a wonderful job clarifying why Intelligent Design is currently the best theory for explaining the origin of life, as well as describing in great detail why competing theories just don't hold any water when it comes to current scientific research.

jj,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Wonderful Insight into the Cell,"Meyer has demonstrated that intelligent design is the inference to the best explanation for the origin of life.

This would be a good resource to share with someone who would like to read a well laid out argument why intelligent design is rational and makes sense. It could help someone who is open to exploring a new paradigm for interpreting much of the scientific data that does not fit with methodological naturalism, evolution, or a completely natural godless worldview.

The text has also been useful in its semi-autographical approach to provide motivation for those that support the field and are attempting to persevere towards getting more education or contribute in a positive way to goals of promoting intelligent design. I found the book informative as it described the real struggles associated with espousing a counter cultural ideal, along with the rewards of finding a tremendous amount of supporting evidence.",7
Stephen P. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Making the Case for Vitalism,"Meyer (page 4) defines intelligent design: ""The theory [intelligent design] does not challenge the idea of evolution defined as change over time or even common ancestry, but it does dispute the Darwinian idea that the cause of all biological change is wholly blind and undirected. Even so, the theory is not based on biblical doctrine. Intelligent design is an inference from scientific evidence, not a deduction from religious authority.""

Meyer brings the broadest defense of intelligent design as science, pointing to many different arguments. Meyer points to the origin of genetic information (the so-called ""DNA enigma""), and writes (page 27): ""And if it was the case that evolutionary theory could not explain the origin of the first life because it could not explain the origin of the genetic information in DNA, then something that we take for granted was quite possibly an important clue in a mystery story."" And this mystery story includes many arguments: starting with ""specified information"" or ""functional information,"" relating these to the molecular foundation of life; and providing many philosophical arguments about what constitutes science. Meyer is very thorough and its is easy for the reader to get lost in this long book. Meyer looks at the Dover trial and demolishes the legal arguments made by Judge Jones.

Meyer makes the case for intelligent design, in my view, but he stops short with the causation that underwrites intelligent design. For Meyer, the only known cause for specified information has been human consciousness and agency, and therefore, intelligent causation offers the best available explanation for the origin of many features of life. This is well enough, but Meyer shirts the issue about the manifestation of this consciousness throughout life and in human expressions of consciousness. If we are as much the designing agency, are we only talking about an innate vitality that carries consciousness with it? Meyer is dismissive of vitalism, and ask (page 40) only two questions: ""If organic chemicals could arise from inorganic chemicals, then why couldn't life arise in the same way? After all, if vitalism was wrong as it now appeared, then what is life but a combination of chemical compounds?""

We should not confuse vitalism with a rigid dualism that sees a strict separation between organic and inorganic chemicals. We must look for the source of vitality in the very laws of chemistry, and of physics, and track this source back to the fabric of space-time.

Imagine that we are set out to explore a strange new world, sitting inside a special vehicle that has electronic devices for sending and receiving information between the inside (where we sit) and outside world. This information comes to us by the synthesis of sending and receiving; the vehicle so signified. After years of exploring, we come to an astonishing conclusion about the outside world: its space-time fabrics permits the synthesis of sending and receiving at the most fundamental level; the outside looks strangely like the inside; and no matter how much we travel to the outside we always return to the inside of our special vehicle where we can take off in a new direction again. I have just described a designing consciousness that is consistent with intelligent design. And while we may look to the outside, we never get beyond the blunt roadblock given by the synthesis of sending and receiving where we see ourselves sitting safely in the vehicle that strangely carries the capacity to acquire foresight and make designs that are necessary for our survival.

We sometimes think that consciousness is so much more than life, but according to intelligent design life also arranged itself through the designing consciousness. Therefore, mind is confounded with the life force behind the synthesis of sending and receiving. The vehicle that explores the world need only follow a universal grammar that permits self-cultivation, starting with the most primitive spark of consciousness given to us by mere feelings. Intelligent design transforms into vitalism, and the universal grammar is as much the Tao Te Ching that engages our emotions. Reason is found married to its emotion, consciousness is now non-dual, and the self is no where to be found except it sits safely in the vehicle.

I believe ""Signature in the Cell"" offers compelling arguments to justify my above interpretation. Intelligent design need not be about a white haired designer that is held separate from his creation in a biblical sense, and intelligent design may contradict the many assertions coming from creationism. A designer that is outside space and time (sitting in vehicle) is not a designer that is held separate from deep reality. Space and time make only an observed surface manifold, leaving unobserved most of what makes up the four dimensions of space and time.

And what of the DNA enigma, and this vehicle that makes functional information by the activity of sending and receiving? We would expect DNA to be highly self-regulated, coming in modules, coming with a context dependency that points to beyond DNA to cellular structures.

Meyer (page 460) writes: ""As molecular biology and genomics have revealed new features of the cell's information storage and processing system, they have inspired a new conception of the gene - one in which the gene is no longer understood as a singular, linear, and localized entity on a DNA strand, but rather one in which the gene is understood as a distributive set of data files available for retrieval and context-dependent expression by a complex information-processing system.""

Meyer (page 476) writes: ""Thus, in each new generation, the form and structure of the cell arise as the result of both gene products and preexisting three-dimensional structure and organization. Cellular structures are built from proteins, but proteins find their way to correct locations in part because of preexisting three-dimensional patterns and organization inherent in cellular structures. Preexisting three-dimensional form present in the preceding generation (whether inherent in the cell membrane, the centrosomes, the cytoskeleton, or other features of the fertilized egg) contributes to the production of form in the next generation. Neither structural proteins alone nor the genes that code for them are sufficient to determine the three-dimensional shape and structure of the entities they form. Gene products provide necessary but not sufficient information for the development of three-dimensional structure within cells, organs, and body plans.""",9

I so covet his mind and I have to deal with that issue but that's another matter. This book continues to answer some of the same old pathetic statements by naturalistic materialists. They include ""But who designed the designer?"", ""ID is just creationism in another wrapper"" and other comments that don't even relate to comments Meyer makes concerning design.

R. Chase,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Incredible tutorial on science's attempts to explain the origin of life,"This book is not for those who are not serious and open minded about learning how scientists have attempted to prove just how life first originated out of the primordial ooze. The author carefully and objectively reviews and analyzes(with extensive documentation) the problems associated with each of the principal proposals that have been put forth since Darwin (who never, by the way, addressed the origin of life issue). Contrary to some reviewers of the book, he does not promote (or even suggest) a divine or theological answer to the question of how did life first begin, but rather simply demonstrates from an objective scientific viewpoint the exceedingly great improbability that ""chance and necessity"" are the causative agents by which the information contained in DNA (information which is required for living cells to reproduce and replicate) first came into existence.

Of necessity, the author includes considerable complex descriptive material in his explanations of what the various origin-of-life scientists have written, but whenever possible and appropriate he translates things into more understandable terms by using down to earth examples. However, the book is still far from easy reading, and anyone who is not really interested in learning facts will probably get little understanding from it.",9

Dr. Robert L. Nordlie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,An Absolutely Scientific Argument for Design,"Ignorance is on display in the reviews of those readers who claim that Stephen C. Meyer's book Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design is ""not science."" Meyer meets this argument against the design hypothesis (and a host of others) head on in this excellent book that will capture both the scientific mind and the lay reader's attention equally well. Anyone who claims this book is not science has simply not read it. There is far more scientific evidence for the theory of intelligent design presented in this book than there is scientific evidence for the theory of evolution in Darwin's The Origin of Species, if for no other reason than because of the vast increase scientific knowledge about the nature of life since Darwin's day. Meyer intricately describes living cells not as ""homogenous and structureless globubles of protoplasm"" as Haeckel described them in the 19th Century, but as sophisticated information processing systems and as nanotechnology micro-manufacturing wonders. As Meyer unfolds the story of mankind's increasing understanding of the nature of life, the reader is captivated by what otherwise could be rather dull scientific reading. Instead, he treats the pursuit for understanding about the origin of life much like a mystery writer would. It captured my attention to the degree that I couldn't put the book down. As you read this book you will marvel at the intricacies of the cell's information storage and processing technology. You will be awestruck by the sophistication of the cell's protein manufacturing capabilities. And you will (minimally) be compelled to at least consider the possibility that some kind of intelligent designer had to be behind all of this information and technology.

Meyer does an excellent job of describing the nature of the historical sciences which seek to answer the question of causation. He also does a fine job of describing the scientific method of inference to the best explanation. In addition, He dispenses thoroughly with each of the competing origin of life theories based on chance, natural law, or a combination of the two. Perhaps Meyer's keenest insight comes when he points out that the various origin of life experiments, while failing to explain the origin of information in the cell by natural or material causes, actually provide experimental evidence of the necessity for intelligent design. Whenever scientists manipulate the chemical products of experiments to produce the desired result, program virtual organisms in their cyber evolutionary worlds, or synthesize designer ribosomes in the RNA world, they simply substitute their own designing intelligence for that of the original designer in their experimental efforts to demonstrate the origin of life apart from design.

There were a few times when I felt as though Meyer was belaboring a point, but considering the negative reception that the design hypothesis has received from most of the established scientific community this is understandable. This book ought to be the 21st century equivalent of Darwin's The Origin of Species in terms of its impact on the thinking of the scientific community about the origin of life. Unfortunately, the explanatory power of the evolutionary paradigm is presently being propped up by the scientific establishment, not because the design hypothesis is unscientific, but merely because of the theological implications of this powerful explanation for the origin of life.

God's Undertaker: Has Science Buried God?
I previously reviewed John Lennox's book ""God's Undertaker"" calling it the design mystery novel and said that it was the finest book I had read on the intelligent design controversy. Meyer's book now supplants that one as the finest book in this raging debate. I believe this one is better because it reads even more clearly and is more in depth. Almost 20% of the book is documentation, much of which I believe should have been in the text of the book itself. Taken together, these two fine works by these highly qualified philosophers of science should come to be seen as the final nail in the coffin for Neo-Darwinism. Will that be the case? Only time will tell, but I fear the evolutionary paradigm may have had too much time to consolidate its position of power before scientists were able to discover the ultimate designer's ""Signature in the Cell."" I hope I am wrong. Please read this excellent book, regardless of where you stand in the intelligent design debate.",38
John Q Public,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,This book is the coup de grace to Natualism and Neo-Darwinism,"The folks who left low-star ratings for this book, as you'll notice, offered ad hominen attacks but NO arguments.

I'm supposing that's because they have no arguments. They seem to have a preconceived mind-set that is hostile to any non-materialistic explanation for the existence of digitally encoded functionally specified information--even when that explanation is the best explanation.

If you disagree with Meyer's analysis then you should present your arguments and show everyone where he went astray instead of making ad hominen rants which come across as very anti-intellectual

The truth is that Meyer thoroughly and painstakingly obliterates the hypothesis put forward by Naturalist's and Neo-Darwinist's that digitally encoded and functionally specified information within the cell can arise by blind, directionless, unintentional chance, physical necessity, or any combination thereof. I can see how this might be disturbing if you have ruled out non-materialistic explanations from the get go

This book is annother GIANT nail in the coffin to Naturalistic explanations of life. Meyer lays out and rigorously defends the syllogism:

1. Digitally encoded specified information arises only from intelligence soources

2. The biological cell contains digitally coded functionally specified information
__________________________________________________________________________________

Therefore, the information within the cell has as its best explanation an intelligent source

There is no hand waving in this book. He critically examines all alternatives and uses the scientific method of abductive reasoning to arrive at the best and only plausible explanation which is that the digitally encoded functionally specified information found in the cell has only one known source---intelligence

The argument is that we know intelligent agents can and do produce complex digitally encoded functionally specified sequences, moreover, materialistic theories have proven inadequate for explaining the origin of such information, therefore, the presence of the digitally encoded information inside the cell points to intelligence as the best explanation

I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who is willing to go wherever the data leads. The chapters dedicated to the elimination of chance as a possible explanation for the existence of even a single protein are filled with information which will blow your mind

Also, the Appendix is lengthy and filled with very exciting new discoveries which show that genes are not what we thought they were and that DNA is not destiny. These new discoveries create even further insurmountably problems to Neo-Darwinism.",15

Mr. Meyer leads you step by step to the only conclusion that can be reached by honest scientific inquiry. Life was started by an intelligent first cause.
I'm a few chapters into ""Signature in the Cell"". It tortures to death the scientific arguments against a creator. In fact it exposes the modern evolution paradigm as one long fallacious argument, against the involvement of a creator in life. How much involvement Meyer doesn't answer. But if life was started by a creator. We might as well assume that creator guided evolution toward a predestined outcome.

Elwood D. Baas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,The best on ID so far,"I have read many books on evolution theory and several on Intelligent Design (ID). This is the best on ID because it introduces and deftly uses information theory to make the case for ID. Mathematicians have built up a huge knowledge base on information theory. An important result is that all objects can be assigned an information value called ""bits"" (not to be confused with computer bits). For example, a self-replicating system has to have information of at least 1,500 bits (This verifies what Von Neumann showed years ago using logic an set theory.) The inorganic universe that we can measure so far has information of about 235 bits; a protein molecule, 1,500 bits; a bacterium, 7,000,000 bits; and a cell, 20,000,000 bits. As Meyer points out, mathematicians have known for a long time that to get from 235 bits to 20,000,000 bits goes far beyond any energy evolution to a ""boundary condition of thought"" (design) condition. In Appendix B, he points out that the Landscape theory or multiverse theory is no better than panspermia theory which is pushes the ""hunt for life process"" into the unknown (a favorite of Dawkins). Creating universes out of thin air is absurd and self-refuting. Meyers could have also pointed out that the Anthropic principle is a scientific ""sleight of hand"" which tries to put a human face on chance and evolution: a universe must have observers who understand that there is a universe!

I believe that ""Signature of the Cell"" is a demarcation point of the evolution vs ID debate in separating pseudoscience from real science by separating information from physical laws of physics and chemistry. The energy level arguments of evolution exclude the information or code which has been superimposed on the physical properties by design.

This book is ""one long argument"" for ""The Origin of Species by Super-natural selection"". It will rival Darwin's work when more scientists finally realize that information is the key to life and not chemical/physical properties alone.",38
F. Barfety,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Information...,"Information: un message reçu et compris/a message received and understood. As I read Stephen Meyer's book (itself a lengthy message), I couldn't help but think about the parallels with my mind translating the thousands of characters of the book into useful content, and code translation to produce functional proteins. The most puzzling question to me is how does the DNA/RNA world relate to an immaterial (read not made of proteins or physical bits) consciousness which is able to do just that (translate things). It seems that consciousness/mind must be the driving force directing the process of reading DNA libraries for the whole thing to get off the ground. Anyhow, I found Stephen Meyer's book very compelling with its clear historical account of what researchers have discovered thus far, and his philosophical understanding of it as a student and then professor. I found myself rechecking his useful illustrations and wanting more of the creative examples that Meyer used with his students. I could relate to him on a personal level as he walks his readers through the process of shedding false beliefs for true ones despite the consequences. This is a must read for anyone who wants to understand DNA and talk intelligently about it. You will appreciate Meyer's refreshing grasp of the philosophical issues which is rare these days. Man I loved this book and I give it five stars!",11

Glen Davidson,2.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Discover is what science must do,"Stephen Meyer states that only intelligent design explains systems like codes, writing that ""...forces of chemical attraction between amino acids and these groups of bases [RNA codons] do not explain the correspondences that constitute the genetic code."" P. 247

Yet two researchers report evidence to the contrary:

""We show here that anticodons are selectively enriched near their respective amino acids in the ribosome, and that such enrichment is significantly correlated with the canonical code over random codes.... The ribosome thus serves as a molecular fossil, preserving biological evidence that anticodon-amino acid interactions shaped the evolution of the genetic code."" From the abstract by David B. F. Johnson and Lei Wang, ""Imprints of the genetic code in the ribosome,"" PNAS May 4, 2010 vol. 107 no. 18 8298-8303

What Meyer fails to consider in his book is how there may have been such probable evolutionary intermediates bridging many of the difficulties that he brings up. Certainly the findings above do not clear up the remaining considerable problems in the origin of life, yet Meyer presupposes (without adequate support) that all codes including DNA's are evidence of design, and this evidence for a transitional evolutionary stage undercuts such claims with actual evidence.

One might protest that this came out after the book was published. Exactly, evolutionary science keeps making discoveries, where ID would simply declare design while so much remains yet to be learned, and would do so without any sort of objective evidence. I do not fault Meyer for not reporting what was not known. I fault his inadequate and premature assumptions/conclusions that not only lead to no discoveries, but would impede them if widely adopted.

Now, suppose that astronauts returned from Mars with microbes having a clearly different hereditary code from RNA or DNA, and they said, well, we just decided to make life out of the elements we found in Mars' atmosphere and ""dirt."" Meyer claims that ""intelligent agents"" make just such specified information, which constitutes his ""argument"" that an ""intelligent agent"" created the DNA code. But would he believe that the astronauts actually made life?

Surely not. The trouble is that not only does he have no rigorous science of intelligent design, he uses terms equivocally rather than rigorously. He knows that humans are the only intelligent agents of whom we are aware, and that they do not ""design"" life. The fact that they use languages and codes does not mean that they can create life de novo. Furthermore, if we assumed another intelligence that we never see has intervened ""materially"" in this world, how would we know that ancient human artifacts and art were in fact created by humans, rather than by the ""intelligence"" that made life?

Still, even if we could create life without first observing it, what would that demonstrate with respect to an ""intelligent agent"" designing first life? Nothing, because one has to demonstrate the existence of a cause in science at the time and place where it was supposed to operate, and humans did not exist when life arose. Meyer thinks that he can get around the requirement for evidence of the existence of his ""cause"" by merely asserting that codes only come from intelligent agents, so thereby it's the only cause possible. Aside from the fact that we know very little about the specific chemical reactions occurring on earth and that research into the origin of life is hardly funded like, say, cancer research is, it is relatively simple to come up with a scenario that is at least as good, and I think better, a cause than his that I could then assert is ""necessary"" and that would thereby (using his statements) need no evidence of its existence.

Using Meyer's reasoning, I could more properly say that in our ""uniform experience"" (his phrase) the DNA code comes only from life reproducing than he could ever support the idea that it comes only from intelligence. This is our ""uniform experience,"" while intelligence designing life is not our experience at all. This being the case, I say for the sake of illustration that either cells or relatively complete cell components (the latter of which could ""randomly"" come together to produce cells with a good probability of producing a living cell) must necessarily have rained down from the heavens early in earth's history. This is ""necessary"" because DNA code is really only produced by life (or our mimicry of life--but we can't make life from just the elements even by copying), Meyer supposes that he can well enough rule out life originating on the earth, so it simply must have rained down from the heavens. A few scientists actually believe something like this.

Then I hear all of the protests, not only from scientists but also from IDCreationists like Meyer. Why? Because what have I really explained? I have not matched up specific cause and specific effect any more than Meyer ever has with his hypothesis, I just asserted that it was ""necessary"" like he did (and it was inadequately argued, similar to his book). I have a kind of ""mechanism"" (life falling), but there is nothing beyond that in my ""theory,"" nothing saying how life was actually assembled from small molecules. Neither, of course, does Meyer, he just writes as though the abstractions of ""codes"" or ""information"" must come from intelligence, when life is neither ""apparently designed"" (if we are unbiased) nor the kind of thing that any other than the most confused humans ever really thought was produced much like we make our creations.

The upshot of that really is that Meyer simply cannot say with any credibility that ""intelligence"" is the ""necessary cause"" of life at all, since I can make up a half-billion year rainfall of rather complete cellular components (or living cells) which ""explains"" every bit as well and poorly as his ""designer"" does. Neither ""cause"" is rigorous or specific to the effect, and both are thus essentially meaningless ""explanations.""

Meyer not infrequently implies or states that evolution cannot produce what he calls ""specified information"" in any real quantity, either. Unfortunately for him, we have the have the evidence that it did in the previously mentioned evidence for evolution of the genetic code, in the genetic similarities, and in the fossil record--and this includes the progression of life from the simplest forms that occasionally fossilize--the prokaryotes--then the much more complex eukaryotes, and from them on to multicellular life, and then to the incredible evolution of vertebrates (and other organisms, of course).

But evolution by itself makes no prediction that first life in the fossil record must be the simplest that we could discover, rather that is a prediction of abiogenesis (which could not produce any modern cell in one shot) plus evolution. One wonders why anyone would think that Meyer's ""designer god"" (he is far more forthcoming about God being the Designer in materials directed solely at religious audience--see Meyer's Does God Exist? (on Amazon) apologetics targeted at believers) would begin with such simple life, as abiogenesis plus evolution predicts, instead of, for example, Eden. Multicellular life at the beginning would falsify evolution (science puts its claims on the line, Meyer's apologetics does not), while creationism/intelligent design simply tries to sneak God in anywhere it can.

I did give the book two stars, despite finding it to be highly inadequate. Why? Because it is one of the few books out there that discusses the considerable problems in abiogenesis. However, it should have been much better even there. The problems are great enough that he would not need to leave out important information as he does, nor put in information that is misleading.

As to important information left out, he writes (pp. 224-225) as though the early earth's environment would be hostile to forming even amino acids, when at the very least purines, pyrimidines, amino acids, and fatty acids would come onto earth via meteorites. We know this because the Murchison meteorite had these chemicals in it. Likewise, he calculates the odds of a protein made of ""left-handed"" amino acids forming by assuming that left-handed (L) and right-handed (R) would necessarily exist in equal amounts in a pre-biotic setting, when left-handed amino acids (which life uses) were in fact more common in the Murchison meteorite. Certain processes that likely would have existed to some degree on earth could change the ""excess"" of L forms of all of the amino acids in a body of water into only L forms. These possibilities (they are not all certainties) at least deserve to be acknowledged, but he simply does not mention them.

Misleading information includes this statement: ""Moreover, a number of geochemical studies showed that significant amounts of free oxygen were also present even before the advent of plant life..."" (p. 224). This has nothing to do with the origin of life--which would be seriously impeded by free oxygen--because plants only appear late on earth, at the earliest 700 million years ago (many researchers believe it was much later). We have good evidence for cyanobacteria existing around three billion years ago.

Meyer's overall method of argumentation deserves mention, because it is not proper by any intellectual standards, and he himself violates it where it saves his apologetics. First off, he claims Lyell's uniformitarianism as his method, when science long ago abandoned it. Meyer states that historical scientists should invoke only ""presently acting causes"" (p. 160), while today's geology speaks of events like oxygenation of the earth in the past which have no counterpart today, and the Big Bang (especially ""inflation"") clearly involves causes not acting presently.

Nevertheless, there is no question that activities of his ""designer"" by no means are a cause presently acting today at all. We recognize cave paintings as due to humans because they are akin to what humans produce today, while we never mistake life for being a human creation. I am partly repeating myself here, because it is important to emphasize that he does not follow his own guidelines.

As IDCreationists are wont to do, he both complains that ""intelligence"" is excluded as a cause in science, and then turns around and points to the fact that ""intelligent activity"" is considered a cause in science (p. 436), such as in archaeology. This simply makes no sense, except in the world of ID, which wishes to claim that they are just looking for signs of intelligence. Except that they are not, they are trying to claim that life with all of its marks of unintelligent evolution was made by an intelligence that not only does not do the things that we do, but cannot be shown to exist by the evidence (except it can wrongly be done when one illegitimately insists with equal lack of evidence that coded information comes only from intelligence).

I should note that one reason the activities of the Designer (clearly God) are considered by Meyer to be properly extrapolated from human activity is evidently that Meyer simply considers mind and material to be separate phenomena (p. 393). If our magical immaterial minds can do things, why won't science consider that a magical immaterial mind that we don't know might have made life? Meyer claims that there is ""no free lunch,"" then turns around and invokes the ""free lunch"" from the Designer--yet to him this makes sense, because he writes as though ""mind"" has none of the constraints that science uses (which is another reason his ideas are not at all science, but from the realm of religion). By contrast, all of the evidence that we have is that ""mind"" is simply the result of the activity of a brain that is ""material"" and that is also the result of evolution. Neuroscience is another part of science that IDCreationists like Meyer deny, and even need to deny for the sake of their ""design"" assumptions.

For these reasons Meyer considers the exclusion of his unknown ""cause"" to be illegitimate (even though science never could work with unevidenced ""causes""). Yet he does not seem to think that he should not pass judgment upon research into the origin of life--which actually has had some successes, even though we are far from a full explanation--as having revealed ""material causes"" to be inadequate. He writes that ""...without proscriptive generalization, without knowledge of what various possible causes cannot or do not produce, historical sciences could not determine things about the past."" That is true, which is why we rule out his ""Designer"" as the cause of the cave paintings and the pyramids, let alone something much less like what we have ever seen designers produce--life. Above all, this is because we have no knowledge of his ""Designer"" in science.

Meyer likes to claim that ""foresight"" is evident in things like the genetic code, and in the rest of life as well. But he does not try to explain the many breaks and reshufflings of chromosomes. For instance, four inversions (at least) are identified in the y-chromosome, which almost certainly had a great deal to do with its present existence separately from the x-chromosome from which it evolved (due to no more crossing-over). These ""errors"" (they would errors be in any actual design) are important for understanding evolution, and are marks of a lack of design.

Likewise, the ""poor design"" of an early transitional bird like Archaeopteryx are predictions of evolution, not what a super-intelligent designer would create.

These are just examples of the huge numbers of problems that ""intelligent design"" has yet to explain, and which it typically ignores because it has no real explanation at all. Meyer's book has not broken from ID tradition in that way at all.

Another traditional expectation from IDCreationism is poor scholarship, and quotes taken out of context, and this characterizes Meyer's work as well, beyond what I have already mentioned.

Meyer claims that ""dual-coding""--common in prokaryotes, not common in eukaryotes (such as ourselves)--is a kind of ""encryption"" (it is not, it is usually a means of data compaction) and, yes, he writes that it is something that only intelligence does. Yet we have good evidence that certain aspects of such ""dual-coding"" in prokaryotes are what would be expected to occur as the result of evolution. See the abstract at [...] So his claim about its origins looks at best to be unlikely.

W.-Y. Chung and some colleagues studied some of the few cases of ""dual-coding"" in humans, and Meyer quoted their paper as stating that the origin of these instances ""...is `virtually impossible by chance'"" (Chung, et al., ""A First Look at the ARFome.""). Meyer's next sentence, which starts a paragraph, provides context which shows his confusion of chance with natural selection: ""Nor does natural selection acting on random mutations help explain the efficient information-storage density of the genome"" (p. 464).

But Chung was clearly stating that the maintenance of ""dual-coding"" was naturally selected, which is the opposite of ""chance."" The relevant paper states: ""Maintenance of dual-coding regions is evolutionarily costly and their occurrence by chance is statistically improbable. Therefore, an ARF that is conserved in multiple species is highly likely to be functional"" (Chung, et al.). Natural selection ""pays the cost"" because keeping the dual-coding is (by inference) actually functional.

Another misused source is Michael Lynch. Meyer writes (p. 470) that ""...evolutionary biologist Michael Lynch has argued using standard population genetics, the size of breeding populations of multicellular organisms are simply not large enough to have afforded natural selection sufficient opportunity to shape genomes into structures with the kind of hierarchically organized systems of information storage that they exhibit."" Lynch did not do that at all. There is organization in eukaryotic genomes, but not nearly so much as Meyer claims, which is why Lynch writes:

""The most profound changes [in eukaryotic genomes] include introns that must be spliced out of precursor mRNAs, transcribed but untranslated leader and trailer sequences (untranslated regions), modular regulatory elements that drive patterns of gene expression, and expansive intergenic regions that harbor additional diffuse control mechanisms. Explaining the origins of these features is difficult because they each impose an intrinsic disadvantage by increasing the genic mutation rate to defective alleles."" [...]

It is the putative lack of the efficient organization of the eukaryotic genomes, compared with those of prokaryotes, that Michael Lynch addresses there.

In still another case, Meyer claims that ""on the basis of orthodox evolutionary theory"" evolutionary biologists had assumed that ""homologous genes should, therefore, produce homologous organisms and structures"" (p. 471). Yet text in the chapter note that he uses for reference states the exact opposite: ""Comparative and evolutionary biologists had long assumed that different groups of animals, separated by vast amounts of evolutionary time, were constructed and had evolved by entirely different means"" (p. 558, note 28), and, ""...Ernst Mayr remarked: `Much that has been learned about gene physiology makes it evident that the search for homologous genes is quite futile except in very close relatives...'"" (Ibid.). Mayr was incorrect, but Meyer credits Mayr and others of the same position with a stance 180 degrees from the one that they were taking.

I have focused on problems with Signature in the Cell, certainly, and I would have to say that he does much better in, for instance, telling of the discovery of DNA's form and function. The trouble is that Meyer wrote a book that is superficially plausible to those who neither know what rigorous science is, nor how many mistakes are made in his presentation of his hypothesis.

I do think that one should be aware of the problems that origin of life research has encountered, however his obvious desire to conclude that God made life, and that nothing else could, has led him to make many errors of method and of fact.

Especially when he is claiming faults in evolutionary theory and in the approach taken by evolutionary scientists his statements ought to be subjected to serious skepticism, and ideally one would always consult Meyer's original sources--because in a number of cases he has taken them out of context and implied that they show the opposite of what the authors actually did write.

***** This is a much later addition (9/25/10). I wanted to point out some more of what is wrong with Stephen Meyer's simple resort to ""intelligence"" as the source of codes. The fact of the matter is that ""making codes"" as a known act of known intelligence is reducible to a more fundamental trait of human intelligence, our ability to symbolize and to manipulate our symbols. And there is no indication whatsoever that the DNA code has anything to do with symbolization and manipulation of symbols. Indeed, the work by Johnson and Wang (insert joke) mentioned at the beginning of my review suggests that the DNA code (probably at first it was the RNA code) arose by quite a different process than via known intelligence.

As an example of what I mean by known intelligence--as well as how this can be detected--consider the case of the Indus script (or, ""Indus script""). There is controversy among linguists about whether or not it actually constitutes a written language at all, or if what is called the ""Indus script"" is just a string of symbols that may not involve any kind of ""code"" as such. What is not in question is whether or not intelligence is behind the ""Indus script,"" because the processes of symbolization and abstraction belong to our known intelligence, and, indeed, symbolization and abstraction are generally considered to characterize intelligence, and, depending on definitions, the products of intelligence.

In other words, all humans are capable of symbolic representation and manipulation. Not all humans are capable of making codes (if language is considered to be a code, all human groups use such code, but it is not clear that languages were truly made by humans in any ""design sense""), and our code making is simply an extension of our more basic ability for symbolic representation and manipulation.

IF one thus were able to show that the DNA code were the result of symbolization and/or abstraction, THEN one would have evidence of intelligence. Codes, considered broadly, are just necessary for storing data in strings or molecules. Life, if it were to exist at the level of complexity which in fact is recognized on earth, would almost certainly contain encoded data, regardless of how the code and coded information first appeared upon earth. This means that codes are important for life, and nothing about how such codes arose.

And because there is no indication at all that the DNA code and information in general arose due to known human capacities for symbolic representation, abstraction, and manipulation of symbols, the existence of the DNA code and encoded information tells us nothing about how it arose, only about how the information of life necessarily is stored via code. Abstraction and symbolic representation characterize intelligence. Codes are simply what allow a molecule like DNA to store the information that life needs to exist.

Nils,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Good commentary for the Origin of Life question,"This book contains convincing arguments about how ""specified information"" cannot be developed randomly. If we following Charles Lyell (The Father of Geology) and Darwin's adage that ""the present is a key to the past,"" we have to accept intelligent design as a viable argument for the development of the computer-like program found in the DNA molecule. Today, useful information can only be produced by intelligence. There is no presently existing model that can produce specified information without involving intelligence. Therefore, the actual scientific conclusion should be that life originated by intelligent design unless proven otherwise. However, because of scientific bias, the formula is presented backwards by saying, life was produced naturally and eventually we will prove it. That is not in keeping with the Lyell-Darwinian model. Since we only have proof of specific information being produced by intelligence today, we should assume that such a rule applies in the past as well. The book is long and contains a lot of historic detail. For the average reader, I would think it could be on the boring side. However, for the informed reader, it will be a valuable tool for extending the concept of intelligent design to a higher level.",9
Bill L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Signature in The Cell,"This is an outstanding book, full of carefully thought out scientific proof that Darwin's theory of evolution is mistaken in its assumption that random variation and chance can account for the wide variety of life forms and the makeup and design of the universe. Too bad that the neo-Darwinian establishment have resorted to ad hominum attacks on Dr Meyer, instead of reading and understanding his book as a milestone in the advancement of understanding of the origins of life. It would seem that the Darwinists have a huge blind spot. Perhaps they are incapable of understanding. I have yet to see a review of this book by anyone on the Darwinian side that refutes any of Dr Meyer's salient points supporting Intelligent Design as laid out so skillfully in this book.",24
Mark D.

So many of the negative reviews on Amazon.com, for instance, have clearly not even glanced at the table of contents.

This book is a significant time investment, being almost 600 pages long. To give you an idea of how thoroughly this book is researched, there are 32 pages of bibliography and there are 52 pages of end notes.

Meyer gives an extensive history of scientific methods and demarcation criteria (what is and is not science) for different scientific disciplines. He also gives a compelling case for the necessity of agency in the formation of specified information. I'd be pleased to hear a thorough refutation of his analysis rather than the typical ad hominem name-calling and genetic fallacies. This book specifically deals with the multiple competing hypotheses on the origin of biological life which is understood today as the origin of biological information.

Interestingly, the many detractors of ""Signature in the Cell"" skirt the topic actually found in this book and argue philosophy of science instead of the evidence.",46
Buba,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,The way that every discussion shall be conducted,"When you read this book, you feel that it is a chronicle of human history of increasing knowledge about single cell operation and information purpose in it functionality. I read this book like a novel with a zest of specific nomenclature and classification. It stands for fresh unbiased and innovative approach to most up-to-date knowledge about application of: information, mathematical statistics and computer science in modern biology. I agree that is easier said than done to read all of 508 pages of this book plus every one of meticulous notes. It did take me at least three weeks to absorb about half of facts this book has to offer.
This book is not about religion or God or faith. This book is about science, historical science process, its developments and falls. Author brilliantly teaches us in a direct way about logic, implications, surprise conclusions and unexpected outcome of scientific discussion and debate. I learned a lot from his discussion about evidence and facts interpretation. This book is a ""manual"" for those who like to conduct systematic and methodical conversation. Beside his incredible knowledge on subject, author is offering astonishing skills in arguing with opponents.
From this point of view I highly recommend this book for those who are sophisticated as well as for those who are not. You will learn about subject and you will absorb stylish way to go in any rational and civilizing debate on any subject. Have a nice (and challenging) journey into scientific discussion.",30

David Marshall,4.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Who's signature?,"I come to this book with two peeves, one pet, the other a stray that is beginning to wear out its welcome.

My pet peeve is fanatics who attack ID out of ideological compulsion, rather than using the ""think"" cells hidden deep within their brains to evaluate and argue. That includes most of the reviewers who gave the book 1 or 2 stars so far. Meyer, we are told, is ""lazy,"" a ""creationist,"" ""idiot,"" ""fraud,"" and ""liar"" who hawks ""error-prone"" ""snake-oil,"" ""gobbledygook,"" ""pseudo-science."" We should read Richard Dawkins new Greatest Show on Earth instead (I did -- it isn't about the origin of life, you numbskulls). One ""reviewer"" blasts the book after reading four sentences, and gets 69 of 128 ""helpful"" votes. Another ""reviews"" the first few pages and calls Meyer a liar.

Hardly any negative reviews even try to point to any scientific errors. Two exceptions: reviews by A Miller and K. M. Sternberg are worth reading. Sternberg's is particularly eloquent. (Though having written a couple books on the historical Jesus, I tend to wonder about the objectivity, awareness, and / or good sense of someone who thinks there is no evidence for the life of Jesus!)

My second peeve is a growing dislike for the way Discovery Institute often packages its arguments. I visited DI a year ago when another ID book came out -- I won't name it, seeing no need to embarrass the author. His presentation essentially said, ""Look at all the wonders of creation. How can evolution possibly explain all that?"" When Q & A time came, I was the only one to ask any critical questions. ""That sounds impressive, but why don't you engage the explanations evolutionary biologists offer for those features?"" Like the talk, the book (he gave me a copy) simply ignored detailed arguments.

This book does much better. Meyer's critics to the contrary, he does offer detailed scientific and philosophical arguments. Signature is NOT mainly about evolution per se - it is about the origin of life. It is, therefore, not strictly parallel to Dawkins' books or arguments -- ID is in a sense broader than evolution as a theory, since it seeks to explain things that evolution does not.

My main beef is the book is too long. While many of Meyer's illustrations are interesting, he uses too many, and repeats himself too often. Meyer should chop out some of the remedial 7th Grade biology, cut some stories and the ""I was in Akron when I thought A and in Baton Rouge when B occurred to me"" stuff, and cut the book in half.

The first-person auto-biographical is overworked. No one thinks you're neutral, Stephen -- so just argue! Don't pretend your conversion to ID was purely scientific -- reasonable people understand that people act under a mixture of motives, and the unreasonable ones are not worth arguing with. Dawkins, Behe, Stephen Hawking, and Darwin for that matter write serious arguments without losing ordinary readers; models that Meyer could profitably shoot for.

But the issue here is the origin of life, and when Meyer finally gets to it, he argues it well, I think. The central chapters seem to cover most of the main issues well. He discusses different solutions, and explains fairly clearly why they do not work, and why some sort of design seems preferable. It is interesting that none of Meyer's critics here dispute those arguments. (Again, Miller and Sternberg come closest, but do not really engage his most important points.) I wish, however, that Meyer had expanded those central chapters, and discussed in more detail leading rival contemporary hypotheses.

Many of his secondary arguments work, too. I suppose one can't complain if a philosopher of science writes a lot about the philosophy of science, and I suppose those arguments are made necessary by attempts to marginalize ID proponents through the sheer power of wordplay. Pardon the self-indulgence, but as I wrote in Truth Behind the New Atheism, in response to Dawkins' attempts to marginalize ID proponents: ""David Bohm once defended science as 'openness to evidence.' The best scientist -- or theologian -- is not someone who shouts 'heresy!' when he hears strange views, but one who listens carefully and responds with reason and evidence. When it comes to ultimate questions, 'openness to evidence' is the definition that counts.""

The scientific evidence is what matters, and I would have liked to have seen more detail on that. Still, all in all, a strong ID perspective on the origin of life.",135
A. Chai,3.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,"Was the editor dead, or merely comatose?","This book is long. No, not long...it is LOOOOOOOOONG. It is kind of a stream of consciousness narrative that incorporates the author's journey of discovery into a larger web of the history of modern biological science. I totally don't care about the author's job looking for oil in the gulf of Mexico before transferring to Oxford University. Oh, my. Who will read and enjoy this book?
Unfortunately, scientific illiterates will not enjoy this book. It will be overwhelmingly complex and difficult to understand. Although they will have the occasional ""aha"" moment, they will have a difficult time following the development of the thesis of the book.
More unfortunately, those of us who are knowledgeable about science will find the prolonged rehash of basic scientific concepts to be insufferably boring. After wading through page after page, it is easy to lose the philosophical underpinnings of the thesis of the book.
I guess what I am trying to say is that the medium is drowning out the message. Reading this book will require a great deal of patience and tolerance.

Okay, so what is the thesis of the book? The thesis is EXACTLY the same thesis that has been espoused by Watson and Crick in their ""panspermia"" theory of the origin of life. In case you don't know, ""panspermia"" is the idea that life originated from aliens who seeded our planet with life. Presumably, these aliens were ""intelligent."" And, presumably, they ""designed"" the sperm or seed that caused life to originate in our solar system. Basically, the idea is that DNA is a complex computer code, more complex and compact than the highest tech computers that we have ever designed on earth. The likelihood of all this information showing up spontaneously, due to random chance, is almost infinitely small. So it follows that there was some sort of intelligence that caused life to exist on earth. For Watson and Crick, that intelligence was an alien intelligence. For Stephen C Meyer, that intelligence was...well, he does not make any speculations about the nature of the intelligence that caused life on earth. In this way, Stephen Meyer's ""Intelligent Design"" is far more intelligent than Watson and Cricks ""Intelligent Design."" But BOTH are advocating ID.
Difference between PANSPERMIA and ID:
Intelligent design speculates that there might be an intelligence behind the bioinformatics of the cell. Panspermia is ID with aliens. Which version is in the textbooks? That's right--the one with the aliens. (I know, I read one of my kid's bio texts)

Oh yes, and a rebuke to the ""one star"" crowd that is spamming this review site with comments about ""religious crap"" and ""creationist dogma""....all I can say is that you obviously have not read this book at all. If you had read the tome (and I suspect many of you are not capable of digesting a full 500+ page read of this caliber) you would realize that Meyer never invokes any religious ideas at all, nor does he engage in any ""pseudo-science."" Rather, he recounts the amazing history of genetic research and information theory. He also covers the history of the philosophy of science and origins, finally asking some questions of his own. Ultimately, the reader will be led to evaluate his own assumptions and think. Granted, there are those who are not willing to do either.

My reason for awarding a mere 3 stars to this weighty work is that the editor did not do his job. This book should not have been written in this lengthy narrative style. It is very difficult to tease out the philosophical bits from the technical bits. It is impossible to use this book as any sort of reference. You basically need to mark up the book with page notes and highlights if you ever expect to piece together a narrative that is useable. The editor should have gone through and marked up the book for us. But he didn't. Boo for him.",51
Martin Troyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Information in the Cell,"I read the book Signature in the Cell, DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design (SITC) by Stephen C. Meyer with highlighter in hand. I believe SITC to be a very important piece of the puzzle in establishing the case for design in the biological realm. I must warn the potential reader, the book is thick and very detailed in places. It is worth the read, though.

It is beyond question that the cell contains massive amounts of encoded information. Even the simplest possible, earliest lifeforms were biological storage devices of amazing amounts of information. The real question is, ""What is the original source of this information?"" In SITC, Meyer makes the case that the vast majority of this information cannot have arisen from natural, unintelligent sources and that there must be an intelligence that is the source of this information. However, this is more than just your typical, ""Wow, look at how complex this is and so it must be designed"" claim. He attacks this from many fronts, including the emerging field of bioinformatics. He makes a strong case that since there is no other possible natural source of this kind of information then, like Sherlock Holmes was fond of stating, ""Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth."" This Truth is that the source of the information appears to have come from an intelligent, possibly supernatural, source.

In SITC, Meyer tells the story of his journey to a pro-Intelligent Design (ID) position. He provides a lot of background information on the players in the field and the course of research. Even if one is hostile to the ID position, this book is an interesting read because of the review of the field. He starts with the discovery of the double helix and the recognition that DNA contains encoded information. He even touches on the origins of science and the scientific method, including how to define what it means to test various theories in different scientific diciplines such as physics, history, cosmology, etc. Different tests are applicable in different realms of research and discovery. There is extensive discussion about the nature of science and how to define it consistently (and fairly) across disciplines.

He also discusses information theory in detail, including what probabilistic resources are and how to evaluate the likelihood of various events. He shows how we can make rational decisions about the reasonableness of probabilistic events and when we can conclude that it is irrational to continue to believe in improbable events.

When we see complex, specified, functional information in any other field, we rightly conclude that the source is intelligent. Meyer makes the logical extention to the world of information in the cell. SITC also evaluates the possibility of self-organization, biological predestination, or evolution to be the source of the functional, specified information in the cell. DNA has more than just information capacity (Shannon information); it also contains information content that is used to build proteins and run the cell. The origin of life also requires more than just the DNA. It requires the origination of ""the system for storing and encoding digital information in the cell"" and the origin of the functional interdependence (functional complexity) of all the parts of the cell.

Life consists of not just matter and energy, it also requires information. What is the best explanation for the cell's information, especially for the first life on Earth? Is it chance, necessity, chance & necessity, or something else? I agree with Meyers that the most reasonable explanation for the observed design is that the source is intelligence!

For further study I also recommend The Cell's Design, by Fazale Rana.

Tony Garland,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A fair and comprehensive treatment of the issues involved.,"Having spent most of my career working in applied science (electrical engineering, software engineering), it was the recognition of control-systems in nature (e.g., the flight of the hummingbird, dragonfly, and butterfly) and the design required to make them viable which, in part, led me to eventually reject the Darwinism in which I was inculcated from my youth and to seek a more viable explanation for our origin. This, in turn, led to a reexamination of the Bible - which I had thoroughly rejected in my earlier years - and my eventual arrival as a convinced creationist and born-again Christian at the age of 34.

Since the question of origins figured so importantly in my unexpected conversion, upon initially becoming a Christian I had a fairly extensive library on the related subjects. However, as I grew in my time as a Christian, I came to understand my primary calling to be that of understanding and teaching the Bible itself. Thus, over time, my focus shifted away from science/apologetics and increasingly toward the Scriptures.

Yet, over the years, I have maintained a healthy interest in the subject of origins and apologetic evidence that the world around us reveals compelling evidence for a Master Designer (Rom. 1:20), rather than being the unintentional achievement of chance over vast ages of time. And so it was with great interest that I purchased the kindle edition of Stephen Meyer's Signature in the Cell at the recommendation of a colleague.

I was not disappointed! It seems to me (and many others) that this book is destined to become a classic of our time. Not only is it very readable, but manages to take some fairly complex aspects of microbiology and genetics and make them (mostly) accessible to anyone who would care to spend the time to find out why the ""open and shut case"" for Darwinism, despite the media and educational system's best efforts to convince us, remains anything but ""a fact."" (To be fair, Meyer's treatment concerns information needed for the origin of life, not so much the possibility of subsequent descent with modification which is the domain Darwin's theory. Of course there is still the question as to whether such modifications produce or damage information - creationists asserting the latter. But this is not treated by Meyer as he has more than enough on his plate. If he can make the case that life cannot realistically arise by chance, then the case for intelligence as the best explanation stands.)

At issue, is information. Two exciting technologically-driven developments are happening in tandem which have the potential to topple the reigning paradigm of Darwinism: 1) biotechnology has uncovered the stunningly complex world within the ""simple cell""; 2) our information age is bringing an increasing appreciation among the general populace concerning the nature of information and how it is produced. Concerning this second aspect, Meyer observes:

""We live in a technological culture familiar with the utility of information. We buy information; we sell it; and we send it down wires. We devise machines to store and retrieve it. We pay programmers and writers to create it. And we enact laws to protect the ""intellectual property"" of those who do. Our actions show that we not only value information, but that we regard it as a real entity, on par with matter and energy. [Par. 283]""

The wonderful and mysterious thing about information is that it goes beyond the strictly material realm - pushing into regions which modern ""science education"" has often sought to rule as ""off-limits"" from rational investigation - seeking rulings in the court systems to prohibit the use of information as evidence as if it were purely the realm of fantasies and fairies. Far from such flights of fancy, it is this mysterious information which is at the heart of the computer revolution itself:

""A blank magnetic tape, for example, weighs just as much as one ""loaded"" with new software--or with the entire sequence of the human genome. Though these tapes differ in information content (and value), they do not do so because of differences in their material composition or mass. [Par. 310]""

Day-to-day, our culture completely relies on this mysterious immaterial entity:

""When a personal assistant in New York types a dictation and then prints and sends the result via fax to Los Angeles, some thing will arrive in L.A. But that thing--the paper coming out of the fax machine--did not originate in New York. Only the information on the paper came from New York. No single physical substance--not the air that carried the boss's words to the dictaphone, or the recording tape in the tiny machine, or the paper that entered the fax in New York, or the ink on the paper coming out of the fax in Los Angeles--traveled all the way from sender to receiver. Yet something did. [Par. 303]""

It turns out that one of the central points of the book concerns the question of where information originates? Meyer makes the case that the only known source of specified information is intelligence. In fact, the book becomes a guided tour of sorts where the reader accompanies Meyer turning over various popular stones (theories) to find whether the sort of information evident within biological systems can truly be said to be found under one of them. Of course, those with a Biblical conviction know that there is One Stone which contains the explanation for the origin of specified complexity, but this stone, as we know, is one which cannot be admitted into the classroom because it involves the realm of the supernatural which the hobbled ""what we see is all there is""science of our day has ruled as outside of the realm of rationality and therefore as inadmissible for consideration. And so ""common sense"" has been ruled ""nonsense"":

""Our commonsense reasoning might lead us to conclude that the information necessary to the first life, like the information in human technology or literature, arose from a designing intelligence. But modern evolutionary biology rejects this idea. [Par. 348]""

And so we have this perplexing situation where the only known source of information is intelligence (which, interestingly, has no meaning except as it becomes evident to other intelligent agents), but the study of its origin and the obvious implications - intelligent design - is deemed as ""unintelligent"" and a simple repackaging of ""creationism under the covers."" (Meyer makes a sound and important case that intelligent design is not creationism, nor can or should it be.) Although the implications of information found in biology and living systems are off-limits in the classroom, the man-in-the-street is well equipped to recognize such implications in other areas more visible to the senses:

""Visitors to Mt. Rushmore in South Dakota infer the past action of intelligent design upon seeing some unusual shapes etched in the rock face. Why? The shapes on the hillside are certainly unusual and irregularly shaped, and thus, in this context, improbable. But beyond that, observers recognize a pattern in the shapes that they know from an independent realm of experience, from seeing the faces of ex-presidents in photographs or paintings. The patterns on the mountain match patterns the observers know from elsewhere. [Par. 5821]""

For those of us with experience in the information sciences this inability to admit evidence of information pointing to intelligence into the classroom borders on lunacy. How can it be off-limits to talk about the implications of information in living systems in the classroom when the larger part of the technological revolution is entirely dependent on advances in information produced by the benefits of science and engineering through agents of rational intelligence? No, we are urged, the rational way to explain all this complexity is chance (which nobody has ever seen clean a garage!). Even worse, this is the best we hold out for the hope of a meaningful life to our students! Be motivated! Have a fulfilling and challenging life! Go out and change the world! But just remember: in the end, you are nothing more than random chemistry which slithered out of a pool of slime.

Meyer draws upon the work of mathematician William Dembski in several chapters when discussing the type of information which Meyer and other intelligent design advocates are on about. This is very helpful information because it distinguishes between chance events which are sure to happen verses those which surpass available probabilistic resources.

""Dembski illustrated this by asking me to imagine flipping a coin 100 times and then writing down the exact sequence of heads and tails that turned up. He pointed out that if I was bored enough to do this, I would actually participate in an incredibly unlikely event. The precise sequence that occurred would have a probability of 1 chance in 2 to-the-100th (or approximately 1 in 10-to-the-30th). Yet the improbability of this event did not mean that something other than chance was responsible. After all, some sequence of that improbability had to happen. Why not this one? [Par. 2950] . . . the occurrence of an improbable event alone does not justify eliminating the chance hypothesis. [Par. 3076]""

The fact that we view the particular sequence of coin tosses that was generated as being insignificant is another indicator that intelligence was not involved. As Meyer makes plain in his discussion, we humans have a built-in baloney detector of sorts which we use everyday to distinguish between events which are realistically produced by chance from those which we deem to be ""crooked"" or ""rigged."" We deem chance outcomes to be crooked or rigged (unfairly influenced toward a decided outcome) when we notice patterns or specified (pre-determined) results:

""How improbable does an event have to be to justify the elimination of a chance hypothesis? If we begin to detect a pattern in an improbable sequence of events, at what point should our doubts about the chance hypothesis lead us to reject it as untenable or unreasonable? As a blackjack player repeatedly wins against the house, or a ball repeatedly falls in the same hole, or as a die repeatedly comes up on the same side, or as we observe an event that implies that great odds were overcome in the past--at what point do we finally conclude that enough is enough, that something besides chance must be in play? How improbable is too improbable? The answer is, ""That depends."" It depends on the improbability of the event in question. But it also depends upon how many opportunities there are to generate the event. [Par. 3086]""

This is a key theme of the book: the question is not whether chance can produce results, but what kind of results chance can realistically produce given the amount of time and the specificity of the required outcome. Chance can and does produce results -- indeed must produce a result whenever it operates. The question is whether the result squares with the odds required based on the time, resources, and intentional specificity (designed complexity or purpose) of the result. This specified information is the polar opposite of random noise -- which every communication engineer well knows. And it is precisely the difference between noise and specified patterns, in a communication signal for example, which encodes information which finds its origin (and any interpretive meaning) in intelligence.

But this is saying nothing more than the SETI (the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) project takes at face value: the reception of an encoded signal of specified complexity from deep space would rightly be deemed evidence of intelligence. So here we have a group of critical thinking scientists searching the skies on a project (often fawned over by the media and intelligentsia) seeking evidence and using methodology which has been ruled as ""non-science"" by our courts and deemed inadmissible to your average school classroom. Go figure! No wonder we are producing confused students these days?!

Along the way, Meyer discusses the probability associated with generating a modest protein (which, by the way, is just a small part of what would be needed for life):
The odds of getting even one functional protein of modest length (150 amino acids) by chance from a prebiotic soup is no better than 1 chance in 10-to-the-164th. [Par. 3467]""

""Another way to say that is the probability of finding a functional protein by chance alone is a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion times smaller than the odds of finding a single specified particle among all the particles in the universe. [Par. 3477]""

He also produces a calculation by Demski, which generously allows a long-age universe with every observable particle dedicated to another chance attempt each second to show that the odds related to the simple protein far exceed the probabilistic resources of the universe. This rather sobering reality doesn't stop some cosmologists who retreat to mathematical theory in an attempt to envision an""inflationary cosmology"" allowing for an essentially limitless number of parallel universes in a vain attempt to bolster the probabilistic resources. Never mind that much of the theory involved has more in common with a belief in pink elephants and Alice in Wonderland than reality.

""Consider the ""Boltzmann brain"" phenomenon, for example, over which quantum cosmologists have been greatly exercised. Within inflationary cosmology, it is theoretically possible for a fully functioning human brain to pop spontaneously into existence, due to thermal fluctuations in the quantum vacuum, and then disappear again. Such an entity has been called a ""Boltzmann brain."" Under standard conditions for bubble-universe generation in inflationary cosmology, Boltzmann brains would be expected to arise as often, or more often, than normal occurrences in our universe. Indeed, calculations based upon some inflationary cosmological models lead to a situation in which these free-floating Boltzmann brains infinitely outnumber normal brains in people like us. [Par. 8511]""

Because of Meyer's background in the history of science, some of the most interesting parts of the book discuss developments and approaches to science, including events leading to the famous discovery of the double-helix of DNA.

Meyer is no slouch when it comes to biological systems, following a path through numerous alternative theories which have been put forth as the odds have continued to grow against a chance explanation for the origin of living systems. For example, one such theory which is presently thought to offer relief in the beleaguered quest to explain life without an intelligence cause (the ""RNA world"") is shown to be of little help in truly addressing issues of the origin of the needed information.

An especially helpful aspect of the book is a brief analysis of algorithmic examples and computer programs which are put forth in an attempt to show that complex information can be produced without intelligence. In every case, the experiment itself is shown to be tainted by the introduction of the intelligence of the experimenters themselves, usually in subtle and unintentional ways which are not valid. It turns out to be a bit like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in that the study of the unintelligent origin of information by experiments set up by intelligent agents is fraught with the subtle coupling of intelligence into the experimental system or procedure. As a software developer, this is something I'd been convinced of when reading extravagant claims of computer-based ""proofs of evolution"" even before reading Meyer.

""...the very fact that these experiments required so much intervention seemed significant. By involving ""programming"" and ""engineering"" in simulations of the origin of life, these new approaches had introduced an elephant into the room that no one wanted to talk about, especially not in the methods sections of scientific papers. [Par. 5303]""

Meyer exposes similar experimental corruption in relation to ""prebiotic soup"" origin of life experiments where conditions are carefully controlled by the intelligence of the experimenters who are seeking to show how the results could all come about by chance.

""Most origin-of-life researchers recognized that, even if there had been a favorable prebiotic soup, many destructive chemical processes would have necessarily been at work at the same time. Simulation experiments of the type performed by Stanley Miller had repeatedly demonstrated this. They have invariably produced nonbiological substances in addition to biological building blocks such as amino acids. Without intelligent intervention, these other substances will react readily with biologically relevant building blocks to form biologically irrelevant compounds--chemically insoluble sludge. To prevent this from happening and to move the simulation of chemical evolution along a biologically promising trajectory, experimenters often remove those chemicals that degrade or transform amino acids into nonbiologically relevant compounds. They also must artificially manipulate the initial conditions in their experiments. For example, rather than using both short-and long-wavelength ultraviolet light, which would have been present in any realistic early atmosphere, they use only short-wavelength UV. Why? The presence of the long-wavelength UV light quickly degrades amino acids. [Par. 3712]""

Given the breadth and depth of the book, it is nearly impossible to touch on all that is valuable in the text. Suffice it to say that the book is a tour de force treatment of the secular (but not Biblical) puzzle of the origin of life and related topics.
Time and time again, Meyer returns to the same quandary: intelligent design is admissible as applied in various venues of historical investigation (involving abductive reasoning), but for some reason it is ruled out in relation to biological analysis of how life came to be. One can sense his frustration at this unfairness in numerous passages. For example:

""... anthropologists who discovered the ancient cave paintings in Lascaux, France, knew of only one cause capable of producing representational art. Consequently, they inferred the past activity and presence of intelligent agents. Moreover, they could make this inference confidently without any other evidence that intelligent agents had been present, because the presence of the paintings alone established the probable presence of the only known type of cause--intelligence--of such a thing. [Par. 5421]""

""in hypothetical and real-world cases, the inference to intelligent design as the best explanation for the origin of specified information is straightforward and unproblematic--except, for some, when considering the origin of life. [Par. 6545]""

As important and needed as the intelligent design movement is, it can only go so far. It can point to the evidence for an active intelligence. It can even infer some of the attributes of that intelligence (e.g., the more sophisticated the information, its encoding, and its associated storage and transmission system, the higher the intelligence). But it can never escape beyond the ""glass ceiling"" of nature to the intelligence itself.

As Christians, we know that this is where natural revelation reaches its limits and special revelation (the Bible) enter the picture. And the Bible makes plain that although God speaks through both (Ps. 19), where man has only natural revelation at his disposal, he is considered to be lost and in great darkness (Isa. 9:2; Luke 1:79). Thus, intelligent design can point to an intelligence, but cannot answer whether that intelligence be a Designer with a capital ""D."" Nor can it convey His self-revelation to His Creatures. This is the proper and admitted limit of the intelligent design movement. Without special revelation, it is unable to provide answers which only God's self-revelation can provide. Especially as to why it is that men admit information as evidence of intelligence in many venues of historical investigation except those of a cosmological nature with associated teleological implications? For these answers, we must turn to special revelation:

""John 3:19-20 And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.""",16

Anyone who is open minded at all will realize after reading this book that the theory of evolution as an explanation of the origin of life will soon be a thing of the past. Ever since I graduated with two degrees in zoology in 1959 and 1961, I had been a staunch believer in evolution even though I was a devout Christian. When I graduated little was known about either DNA or the complexity of living cells. Now that we know the information presented in Dr. Meyer's book, there can be no doubt that the only source of the vast information contained within every cell of every plant and animal could only come from an intelligent source. That source could only be either human beings (and we weren't there at the time of the creation of first life) or some intelligent source above humans. Since the ID theorists, most of whom are scientists, have no way of identifying who or what that higher source may be, they are not speculating on His/Her name, even though many of them are Christians.

Meyer skillfully shows how people define science in such a way to arrive at the conclusion they want ahead of time. Then he takes the debate to the level it should be argued, viz. is a proposition true and how would we know it? What is the supporting evidence? How does the explanatory power of his design theory match up to the reigning paradigms of chance and necessity in the historical biological sciences?

Meyer demolishes the 19th century arguments which have been based on random variation and natural selection by giving the reader an incredible 21st century journey inside the cell. Without the scientific means in his day, Darwin thought the cell was just a mere blob of protoplasm. Today, however, we know that each cell is an incredible computerized manufacturing plant -- on the order of the complexity of a robotic car manufacturing plant. Currently neo Darwinian theory says that random unplanned events plus unguided forces constructed this ""plant"" -- and without a blueprint! Worse yet, the ""computers"" needed to operate the plant arose by chance. Blueprints must conceived by a design engineer, and computers only operate because a computer programmer designed how the information needed by the blueprint will be stored, transmitted, processed and then converted to drive the machines. ID theory rests on what 21st century science has proven to be true.

Mathematicians have know for decades that the chance requirements of the neo Darwinian models are totally inadequate, but many biologists have refused to acknowledge it. Meyer proves beyond a shadow of a doubt, using Dembski's model of complex specified information (Cambridge University Press), that the mathematical necessity demanded by the neo Darwinian model exceeds the probabilistic resources of the entire universe -- a fact now acknowledged by most origin of life scientists. So with no mathematical nor engineering mechanisms to explain evolutionary theory, neo Darwinists criticize Meyer who offers a totally realistic, logical and provable explanation --- that intelligent design had to play a role in the origin of life and most probably in the origin of the species.",40

Darrel R. Falk,1.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,On Reading the Signature: a BioLogositical View,"I believe there is a Mind who was before all things and through whom all things are held together (Colossians 1:17): I believe that Mind is the intelligence behind all that exists in the universe. Hence, I believe in intelligent design. Does that by definition then, place me in the Intelligent Design (ID) movement?

No.

The recent book, Signature in the Cell, by ID movement leader Stephen C. Meyer, illustrates why.

Meyer holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Cambridge and is an expert in the philosophy of science. Admittedly, I am only an amateur in his area of expertise, but there were times as I was reading his book, when I was enthralled by the highly articulate explanation of how the tools of scientific logic enable us to become quite certain about the cause of natural events in the distant past. Similarly, his discussion of attempts to meaningfully define science was outstanding. He showed how the term has taken on new meaning based on practice. Today, as it is carried out by almost all practitioners, science has become synonymous with methodological naturalism. Meyer may have been overly optimistic when he wrote, ""recently however, this [definition] has begun to change as more scientists are becoming interested in the evidence for intelligent design"" (p. 437). Still, I enjoyed his discussion of the political and philosophical maneuvers of those with a vested interest in how this term ought to be defined. This is Stephen Meyer at his best. He is very effective in communicating philosophical issues to a general audience. Perhaps it is no surprise then, that a world-class philosopher, Thomas Nagel of New York University, recommended Signature in the Cell to The Times Literary Supplement as one of the best books of 2009.

It is important to emphasize, however, that the Intelligent Design movement is not purported to be philosophical or religious in nature. The leaders, including Stephen Meyer, emphatically declare this is a scientific movement and it needs to be judged on the quality of its science, not its philosophy or theology. So Meyer has expanded his extensive reading list to include numerous journal articles and books within the field of biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics. His purpose has been to assess the quality of the scientific interpretations of the data as it relates to the origin of the information inside of cells. He has reached the conclusion that the sciences of biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics have come to a dead end and that the only reasonable scientific explanation now is that the information inside of a cell is the product of an external mind.

Many scientists think that as life began, its source of information was found in RNA molecules. There are specialized reasons for this, which are not germane to the point I want to make. Suffice it to say, however, that Meyer suggests that the two different conditions for making two of the key building blocks that characterize an RNA molecule are incompatible (p. 303). In other words, the conditions under which one building block could have been synthesized on the early earth would have resulted in the destruction of the second building block, and vice versa. Since there is no way that both could have been produced simultaneously on a primitive earth, Meyer declares that RNA could not arise without the input of a mind. As he was writing these words, however, some elegant experiments were taking place at the University of Manchester that showed there is a way, a very feasible way that both building blocks could have been produced through natural processes.

In Chapter 14, as Stephen Meyer brings his discussion about the feasibility of RNA's role as the early storehouse for cellular information to a conclusion, he recalls a twenty year old conversation with a philosophy professor about origin-of-life-research: ""The field is becoming increasingly populated by cranks. Everyone knows everybody else's theory doesn't work, but no one is willing to admit it about his own."" Following this statement, Meyer fast-forwards into the present, and writes of his own assessment of the field twenty years later: ""I found no reason to amend these assessments"" (p. 322). As a geneticist, I am taken aback by this assessment. The work he had just been discussing is the work of Jack Szostak who was awarded the Nobel Prize a few weeks ago. I've heard Dr Szostak speak a number of times. He is no crank. He is widely regarded as a brilliant mind. Read his Scientific American article for yourself (seefootnote, below), you'll see he is also very frank about the strengths and weaknesses of his current thoughts about life's origins. Also, his work is by no means at a standstill. Only a philosopher, I suppose, or someone else quite naïve about how science proceeds at a lab bench would be able to make such an assessment.

Immediately prior to Meyer's assessment about cranks in the field of origin-of-life-research, he had also been discussing the work of Gerald Joyce of The Scripps Research Institute. I have also been privileged to hear Dr. Joyce speak on at least three occasions. He, like Szostak, is widely regarded by biochemists and molecular biologists as brilliant. Like Szostak, I find that his discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the RNA world model is cautious. He knows there are many unanswered questions, but he has made great strides at answering some of them. At the time of writing Signature of the Cell, Dr. Meyer correctly concluded that no RNA molecule had ever been evolved in a test tube which could do more than join two building blocks together. However, while the book was in press, Gerald Joyce and Tracey Lincoln published an article in Science in which they demonstrated that evolved-RNA can take on a second function, the all-important replication activity. In just 30 hours their collection of RNA molecules had grown 100 million times bigger through a replication process carried out exclusively by evolved RNA molecules. So another dead-end pronouncement by Meyer was breached even while the book was in press.

I want to give one more example which demonstrates Meyer's disappointing tendency to reach premature conclusions based on his unsuccessful attempt to move from philosophy into genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology. Dr. Meyer evaluates the work of the population geneticist, Michael Lynch of Indiana University. He points out the Lynch has proposed that ""the structure of the genome can be explained by a neutralist theory of evolution based mainly on genetic drift"" (p. 470). Meyer concludes in just a sentence or two that Lynch is wrong and that genetic drift is less likely than natural selection. Again, I am very puzzled by this conclusion in what is purported to be a science book which is examining scientific data. Lynch is one of the finest population geneticists in the world. What experiment or calculation has Stephen Meyer done to put himself in a position to tell Michael Lynch which of two possible scenarios is more likely? Yet he does this in a single sentence.

Signature in the Cell is by most accounts considered to be a highly successful book. From a philosophy perspective, it is considered by at least one leading philosopher to be one of the best books of 2009. From a religious perspective, Meyer, on the basis of this book, has just been declared ""Daniel of the Year"" by the widely read evangelical periodical World Magazine. From the public persona perspective it has sold very well--Amazon.com had it on one of its top ten lists for the 2009 best sellers.

However, the book is supposed to be a science book and the ID movement is purported to be primarily a scientific movement--not primarily a philosophical, religious, or even popular movement. Meyer argues throughout the book that his theory about the origin of information is scientific, not religious. He makes it clear that he wants it to be considered on its scientific merits alone. I am comfortable with this. Let it be evaluated on the basis of its science. Like him, I believe in intelligent design. However, I am also a scientist. So I need to evaluate this book in the way that he calls all of us to do, as a work of science. I must consider whether this philosopher, this Christian brother, this best-selling author, and this leading debater has been successful at analyzing the data of the world's leading scientists--people who have given their careers full time for many years to asking (and answering) very sophisticated questions about whether material causes have created information.

There is no question that large amounts information have been created by materialistic forces over the past several hundred million years. Meyer dismisses this without discussing it. What about at the very beginning, 3.5 billion years ago? Everyone doing the science, Meyer notwithstanding, would say the jury is still out. There are some very elegant feasibility experiments going on at the present time. However, it is far too early for a philosopher to jump into the fray and declare no further progress will be made and that this science is now dead. If the object of the book is to show that the Intelligent Design movement is a scientific movement, it has not succeeded. In fact, what it has succeeded in showing is that it is a popular movement grounded primarily in the hopes and dreams of those in philosophy, in religion, and especially those in the general public. With all due respect for the very fine people associated with the ID movement, many of whom I have met personally and whose sincerity I greatly appreciate, our hopes and dreams need to be much bigger than this. The science of origins is not the failure it is purported to be. It is just science moving along as science does--one step at a time. Let it be.",44

Paul J. Palcsak,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Science VS Scientism...,"This book re-sets the bar in the debate. For the record, the specific debate is, ""Life: ungiuded process or guided process - where does the evidence lead?""
This is the question that Dr. Meyer addresses and with effortless apblomb, unfolds the matter-of-fact scientific case that completely dismantles the metaphysical assumptions that undergird undguided evolution. At the same time, he affirmins the positive evidence in favor of intelligent agency as the only causally adequate explanation for the origin of life.

We have extensive experience with the unique signature of intelligent agents with no need at all to resort to the supernatural and this experience is what Dr. Meyer brings to the debate. None of the one-star reviews deal with the book on these terms. Rather, they all try to pigeon-hole the work into a metaphysical black hole. It is both sad and comical that what emerges from these collective reviews is the metaphysics of the reviewers. Their reviews are their own worst indictment. If the evidence points to life as a guided process, then that is where the evidence points. If Smith's philosophical presupposition is all that prevents Smith from following such evidence to its logical conclusion, then Smith is guilty of philisophical, anti-scientific motivations.

To read the one-star reviews of this book is to understand that to attribute philisophical, anti-scientific motivations to their authors is an undeserved charity. As the old lyric goes, ""the poets down here don't write nothing at all, they just stand back and let it all be"" The one-star reviews reveal the bankrupt position of the reviewers eloquently.

John H. Terrell,3.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Meyer Hears a Who!,"Meyer posits that DNA contains information that could be provided only by an intelligent designer. That's interesting but not particularly informative from a scientific point of view. The crucial question is: ""HOW was this information conveyed from the designer to the DNA?"" Meyer doesn't even hazard a guess at an explanation. In the absence of such an explanation, Meyer has contributed nothing to advance a viable theory of abiogenesis. This review could end right here, but I have some nits to pick with Meyer: Here are just two:

First, Meyer preaches the Creationist gospel according to Phillip Johnson, that evolution by mutation and natural selection is an undirected process (i.e., chance) and thus could not possibly have been responsible for the diversity of life on earth as we know it. Nothing could be further from the truth: such evolution is highly directed - not to the future, but to the immediate environmental requirements. Also, only a creation science advocate would include the Grand Canyon as an example of an event (p. 29).

Meyer uses Dembski's improbable probabilities to support the thesis that evolution equates to pure chance. Drs. Kenneth Miller and Ian Musgrave have shown the fallacious basis of Dembski's calculations. Musgrave also points out the crucial gaps in Meyer's and Spetner's knowledge of protein processes. (See Spetner's ""Not by Chance"" and Musgrave rebuttal (Google ""Spetner and Biological Information"").

Second, Meyer plays fast and loose with the truth in his remarks about the Dover Trial (Chapter 18). He opines that Judge Jones reasoned that since expert witnesses Robert Pennock and Barbara Forrest argued that the theory of Intelligent Design is not scientific by definition, then it must be religious. Meyer neglects to mention that Forrest also provided incontrovertible proof that ""Of Pandas and People"" was originally a creation science (religion-based) text that was transformed into a ""science"" text by simply replacing ""Creation Science"" with ""Intelligent Design"" (Google ""Judgment Day Intelligent Design on Trial summary"").

Additionally, Meyer uses Behe's concept of ""Irreducible Complexity""(IC) to support his Intelligent Designer argument, but Behe's contention of IC was thoroughly demolished at the trial. Behe's last day of testimony (19 October 2005) was so embarrassing that the Discovery Institute still hasn't posted it on their website "" The Truth About the Dover Intelligent Design Trial""). It can be seen, however, on the ACLU's website (Google ""ACLU Dover Trial Transcripts"").",82

A lot of the one star book reviews seem to be attacking Dr. Meyers, and not the topic of his book. Please let us get something out of the way up front. ""Signature of the Cell"" is not about Stephen Meyer, the Discovery Institute or God for that matter. It is about an argument, and a lot of the negative (and positive, let's be honest) reviews seem to overlook this fact. There is a lot of spin on both sides of the Intelligent Design debate. One side often states that Judge Jones III was appointed by George W Bush, while another side makes certain we know that Judge Jones III was previously a former Head of a Liquor Control Board. Please let us approach this topic with reason and give our honest-if biased-opinions.

In ""Signature in the Cell"", Dr. Meyers walks us through what information is and the different ways information is defined, created and discovered. He also goes into great detail on probability theory and the history of scientific reasoning. He then lays out the history of origins of life research including a fascinating exposition of the discovery of the DNA double helix, and the surprise of specified information that lies within. Dr. Meyers argues why the current OOL theories fail to explain how the first cell could have arisen by chance alone due to the insufficient probabilistic resources (temporal as well as physical) of the universe. He further argues why self organization/bio-chemical predestination models do not provide an adequate explanation for the origin of life. He also explains why the RNA world and other current models fail to explain the OOL, or what Dr Meyers calls the ""DNA enigma""

The DNA Enigma is that which researchers have not been able to uncover. That is, the origin of specified information or digital code in every living cell. The information in the DNA molecule is not only complex, but has specified complexity. All of the current OOL models Dr. Meyer critiques contain what he terms the ""displacement problem"" That is they push back the source of the information or assume that the information simply occured or merely ignore the source, and put it on the back burner. In the book Dr. Meyers explains why evolutionary computer simulations and that why trying to manufacture ""life in the lab"" are actually very good examples of ID and are ideal cases for design theory.

Dr. Meyer does not make an appeal from ignorance or a ""God of the Gaps"" argument, but makes a positive case for design in OOL. Dr. Meyer appeals to the same historical branch of science that Darwin employed, and argues that if ID theory is arbitrarily deemed unscientific then Darwin's theory would fail to be classified as scientific on the same reasoning.

For those that say that ""ID is not science"", please read chapter 18 of the book-""But is it Science?"" Following are the headings for the reasons Dr. Meyers regards ID as science, specifically historically scientific..
Reason 1: The case for ID is based on Empirical Evidence.
Reason 2: Advocates of ID use Established Scientific Methods.
Reason 3: ID is a Testable Theory.
Reason 4: The Case for ID Exemplifies Historical Scientific Reasoning.
Reason 5: ID Addresses a Specific Question in Evolutionary Biology (OOL).
Reason 6: ID Is Supported by Peer-Reviewed Scientific Literature.
(You'll have to read the book for the details.)

""Signature in the Cell"" is not ""Creationist Tripe"", but a 600 page argument. Dr. Meyers does not necessarily argue for a God as the intelligent agent behind the OOL, but that an intelligent agent is the most likely cause of the specified information in the double helix and information processing systems of the cell. Dr. Meyers argument is not that ""It is way too complicated to understand
so therefore God did it"" but an appeal to what we know about how information is created and that information comes from minds, or agents. As some like to say and I'm paraphrasing several ID opponents here..""Let's not kid ourselves, we all know who Dr. Meyers means when he says an intelligent agent, he means God"" Well maybe, or if your ontology will allow, probably, but both Richard Dawkins and Francis Crick believe in, or are at least sympathetic to an intelligent agent as the cause of life on earth. They just believe that the intelligent agent was or could have been extra-terrestrial. The panspermia theory too has it's problems, and ultimately pushes back the OOL or ""DNA Enigma"" to an earlier time and certainly from what we know of the universe, one is stopped by the previously mentioned wall of probabilistic resources.

In the epilouge Dr. Meyers opens the door to some of the latest discoveries of the hierarchical nature of DNA information storage. Quite interesting really, Super folders, folders within folders in optimized locations for efficient retrieval. He also touches briefly on what used to thought of as ""Junk DNA"" or non protein coding regions of the DNA molecule. What was once considered to be only leftovers and redundancies from transcriptions can now be shown to work as a sort of operating system. It will be interesting to see what comes from the ongoing research..

Dr. Meyer concludes the book in Appendix B with solid critique of multiverse theories and in chapter 17 provides a very powerful answer(rebuttal) to the ubiquitous ""Who designed the designer?"" question (challenge).

There IS an answer to the DNA Enigma, and Dr Meyer's positive argument is that life on earth was caused ~3-4 billion years ago by an intelligent agent, most likely God. Perhaps he is correct.",425
M. Lamb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A Wonderful Comprehensive Evidence Based Review of Origins,"Dr. Meyer does an outstanding job of giving a very detailed in depth analysis of all the possible scenarios to explain the origins of life. He systematically dismantles the invalid theories using solid evidence in a very objective manner. He puts forth the most plausible theory of origins, that of intelligent design, again using solid unbiased evidence. In reading this book, one surmises that the competing theories of origins have been dealt a final blow of defeat, while intellignet design comes to the forefront as the only plausible explanation.

Gary S. Hurd,1.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,"Obsolete, Misleading Cut n' Paste","Regarding the grossly false creationist claims in ""Signature in the Cell,"" I would first point out one of the things that most irritated me.

From about page 223 to 226, we have a cut n' paste with only trivial alterations from an 1998 article Meyer wrote, ""DNA by Design,"" published in the prestigious biological journal ""Journal of Rhetoric & Public Affairs."" (Yes, that was sarcasm). Text from ""DNA by Design"" appears quite often in ""Signature."" The most irritating feature is that in ten years between that early text and ""Signature,"" Meyer had not even bothered to update critical references, let along his outdated thinking. Most obvious was that in both publications, a footnote (#21 in ""DNA"") appears with nearly identical citations as the 1998 article. I'll quote it below, because if illustrates another problem with Meyer's so-called scholarship.

(from Meyer 1998, which appeared with trivial alteration as footnote 10-15 in Meyer 2009) 21. L. C. Berkner and L. L. Marshall, ""On the Origin and Rise in Concentration in the Earth's Atmosphere,"" Journal of Atmospheric Science 22 (1965): 225-61; R. T.

How did this vary in Meyer's ""Signature?"" Well, the publication dates, and journal data were all removed to a bibliography. But aside from formatting, Meyer added a two additional outdated references, Towe (1996), and Kasting (1993).

What did Meyer use this group of citations to support? That the late-Hadean, early-Archean had an oxygenated atmosphere, and that without ""intelligent intervention,"" which in IDC speak means ""goddidit,"" all chemical reactions on the primitive Earth result in ""biologically irrelevant compounds-chemically insoluble sludge."" (Meyer 2010, pg 226).

Meyer, in 1998, might have been justified in thinking that scientific opinion was divided among geochemists regarding the Earth's early redox state. After all he is not really a geologist, nor a chemist. But, even though his under-graduate geology degree was from a religious school, his continued ignorance was not justified in 2008-2009.

Publications, several by the very people Meyer has cited, since 1998 have conclusively made the case for a late-Hadean / early-Archean reduced atmosphere, or at most a neutral atmosphere with common, strongly reducing oasis. Even articles readily available prior to 2008 make this obvious, and subsequent research has ""capped"" the argument.

Bruce David,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,The best ID book so far.,"This book is for several reasons the best so far written by a proponent of intelligent design (ID). Although limited in scope (it basically restricts itself to the question of the origin of life), it is at the same time comprehensive, which is to say that at over 600 pages it thoroughly covers the topic. But more importantly, it is eminently readable and its explanations are models of clarity. For instance, Meyer's treatment of the notion of information and his explanation of the difference between Shannon information and functional information is the clearest and easiest to understand that I have seen so far (and I am pretty well read in this particular genre). If you have an open mind and can read only one book on the subject of ID, I recommend this one.

Meyer was a working professional in geophysics when he chanced upon a debate about the origins of life. It was for him one of those events that changes the course of one's life. He became fascinated with the question, ""Can one make a scientific case for the proposition that intelligent design was involved in the creation of life on earth?"" He believed that it was possible, and applied to the doctoral program of Cambridge University in England. He was accepted and subsequently earned a Ph.D. in philosophy of science. His thesis addressed that question. Since then, he has been refining and expanding his thinking on the subject, and this book is the summation of that work. Using the same inferential methods as are used in the other historical sciences (geology, paleontology, evolutionary biology, archeology, etc.) Meyer argues that ID is the most reasonable explanation for the origin of life, from a scientific perspective. (There is not a single religious argument for ID in the entire book.)

It becomes clear on reading this book that unless you reject the possibility of ID on a priori grounds (for example if you are a philosophical materialist) Meyer's conclusion is inescapable: ID is the best explanation for the origin of life, given our current understanding of the laws of nature and the nature of probability. The only reason to reject this conclusion is on religious or metaphysical (not scientific) grounds. There are those who would argue that materialism is ""proved"" by modern science. This book clearly demonstrates that they are wrong.

It should be noted that although Meyer does not address the adequacy of the neo-Darwinian synthesis to explain the evolution of life on earth, there is one fact that he presents, almost in passing, which by itself destroys the Darwinian explanation of macro-evolution (the emergence of new body plans, organ systems, structures, or processes). This fact is an experimental finding presented in a peer reviewed paper by Douglas Axe that the ratio of sequences of 150 amino acids that fold into a three dimensional structure to those that don't is roughly 1 in 10^70. Now 10^70 is a very, very large number, which makes 1 in 10^70 very small indeed. Why is this fact so devastating to the neo-Darwinian synthesis? Because it is a central tenet of the theory that new proteins, which are essential to any macro-evolutionary advance, arise by random mutations to existing proteins. (I simplify somewhat here--the mutations actually occur in the genome.) But every protein found in nature folds into a three dimensional structure. When one factors in the facts that most proteins are considerably longer than 150 amino acids (average length 300, some as long as 1000), that macro-evolutionary advances usually involve not just one, but many proteins working together, that not all proteins that fold are functional, and that natural selection cannot work until there is something functional to select, the probability that any macro-evolutionary advance can occur to be selected becomes so infinitesimally small as to be virtually impossible. It is even impossible that one could occur on any of all the possible earth-like planets in all the galaxies in the known universe since the Big Bang.

One final note. If you are reading this, and you have actually come to the ID debate with an open mind, I urge you to ignore the one-star reviews. This book is far too good to be deserving of only one star by any objective review, even if the reviewer disagrees with its conclusions. I suspect that the majority of writers of one star reviews have not even read it. There is really only one reason that someone would give this book one star, and that is that THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO READ IT. If these people had the power enjoyed by the medieval church or today's Taliban where it is in control, they would certainly ban this book (and the others they disagree with). Fortunately for freedom of expression and for those of us who wish to have access to all the information to make up our own minds on the subject, they don't possess that power.",44
Mike Warrior,4.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A compasionate book on the evidence for intelligent design.,"Is intelligent design just filling in the gaps what evolution doesn't know? Hardly, instead it's approach is asking critical questions and trying to find answers for them about the origin of life.

With great clarity and thoroughness, Meyer demonstrates that even the simplest life forms require vastly more information to exist than could have occurred solely as a result of random mutations and natural selection. Many find this an unacceptable conclusion but, using up-to-date scientific information and the logic traditionally used in science, it's clearly the reasonable conclusion, even taking into account, as Meyer does, all of the alternative theories and all of the arguments against and objections to the idea of intelligent design.",48

Paul Vjecsner,4.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Exceptional,"The author makes wonderfully clear to the layperson what is known about the cell, using many helpful illustrations, and he supports his arguments as well as can probably be found in the literature.

Among his good arguments for intelligent design of natural entities is not only the intelligibility of the universe, assumed by past great scientists as the intent of a Creator and the corresponding justification for exploration of serviceable laws of nature, but also particular observations, as that (p.332) ""natural processes tend to degrade information, rather than generate it [having in mind the contrary generation of genetic 'information']. Messages written in the sand are eventually erased by the waves; old newspapers yellow and eventually crumble without care from an archivist...Information inputs typically exceed (or at best equal) information outputs, unless, of course, intelligent agents have intervened."" Or that (p.394) ""Our uniform experience shows that minds have the capacity to produce [functional] specified information. Conversely, experience has shown that material processes do not have this capacity. This suggests--with respect to the origin of specified information [as in the cell], at least--that mind is the better candidate to be the fundamental explanatory entity"".

There is to me some problem with the nomenclature, and also with some underlying concepts. I put above the word ""information"" inside quotes because its appropriateness is somewhat questionable, as the author himself admits in supposing it a metaphor (p.386 ff). We tend at different times to compare man and other natural entities with prevailing machinery, which today is obviously the computer, used predominantly for information. So we ascribe information to other phenomena, presently to such as DNA. There is, however, nobody receiving that information as might be expected. Instead, the ""coding"" constitutes chemicals of certain causal properties. It may be helpful for intelligent-design proponents to speak of information because it commonly originates in a mind, but it is not necessary for their arguments. The functionality and non-degradation in organisms they speak about above, for instance, is enough to establish the likeness of these to states known only to result from human intelligence. Similarly the word ""specified"", connoting instruction, is not truly applicable in cells and appears equally unnecessary if not confusing.

With these expressions is also coupled ""complex"", for a requisite in determining design. Complexity may well be an attribute in organic forms which is, as argued, not reducible if to retain function, in contradiction of Darwinism's gradual functional changes. But it is another thing to generalize complexity as a telltale of design. The book's author invokes as example (p.353) the sculpted portraits of U.S. presidents on Mt. Rushmore. He writes, ""observers recognize a pattern in the shapes that they know...from seeing the faces of ex-presidents [or people in general]..."" Certainly that recognition of human faces indicates design. Author Meyer, though, continues: ""Since these particular shapes are also complex, the faces on Mt. Rushmore point, according to [other author, William Dembski], to intelligent design."" This is erroneous. The rest of the mountain can be held just as complex, and should we find a near-perfect sphere etched into it, we could likewise infer human design, although a sphere can be considered extremely simple.

The book nonetheless persuasively argues that even the complexity of the elements required to form the first life is far too great to make statistically tenable that it result from the workings of the undirected forces represented by Darwinian processes like random mutation and natural selection. In contrast, as said in the book (p.445): ""Because both classical Darwinism and modern neo-Darwinism deny that the appearance of design in living organisms is real, they affirm that the process that gave rise to that appearance is blind and undirected...[L]eading evolutionary theorists claim that biological evidence overwhelmingly supports this purposeless and fully materialistic account of creation."" Apparently appearances deceive; there is no purpose in life.

But as the book ably argues, it is false that ""biological evidence overwhelmingly supports this purposeless"" account. And there is more. Purposefulness in life can be not only inferred, from the appearance of design in the organism's functional form, but can be observed, in the organism's completely overlooked and pervasive purposeful action toward self-preservation. This reviewer has been trying to bring this to the attention of readers, and dealt with it in depth in his book. It should be beneficial to lend an ear to it.",46
O. Rivera,4.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A lucid and well reasoned answer to an eternal question,"This well researched book provides a lengthy scientific account of an alternative view to evolution as being the vehicle responsible for transporting humans and in fact all living creatures, from the primordial soup to the present.

The epiphanal point for me was the moment when it became clear that the ""programing"" of the countless and complex functions that take place in a single cell and that require such exquisite timing could not have occurred by chance or as a series of gradual changes as proposed by proponents of evolution. It points to a superior Intellegnce.

Signature In The Cell makes for great reading.",30
John P. Rickert,4.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,DNA is not (just) a chemical,"The key message of this book, I think, can be put in the following way. Meyer does not put it this way himself, and if you disagree with me, you might not disagree with him. The message is: DNA is not a chemical, and therefore not just a chemical. DNA is composed of chemicals, certainly: A, C, T, G, and the rest, which do have well-defined chemical structures. For example, think of water, H2 O: two hydrogen atoms, one oxygen, and a very definite arrangement of them. But DNA is not a chemical in this sense, even though it is composed of chemicals. There is no ""chemical formula"" for DNA, and that is a reason why DNA has a flexibility to carry information far greater than the invariable structure of a water molecule.

When we look at the information content in a DNA molecule, we can first conclude that the information is not there as if by necessity. For example, the chemical structure of salt naturally makes it capable of forming crystals. The crystalline structure of salt is a direct consequence of the structure of salt. But the informational content of DNA and RNA is not like this, because the actual arrangement of the components is variable. Again, DNA is not a chemical the way water is a chemical; it doesn't have a fixed formula, and information is conveyed in what is variable. To borrow Meyer's example: the letters of the alphabet have fixed forms, but the spelling of words is not a necessary consequence of the properties of the letters. The same holds for A, C, T, G in regard to DNA.

Further, we can see that the informational content of DNA is so high that, relative to comparable molecules, i.e., ones of similar length and constituent building blocks, DNA is an extremely remote outlier. So remote that, using standard statistical methods and tests, we can conclude that DNA is not part of the population of molecules that would arise simply by chance.

The best explanation for this information, Meyer argues, is intelligence. Intelligence -is- capable of organizing and producing information, so at least it should make the lineup for consideration as an explanation; Meyer proceeds to examine and screen out the other possible explanations. By thus screening out, intelligence remains the only real possibility, or at least, the best, to explain the information seen in DNA, RNA, and proteins.

One could also add a highly pertinent observation from Etienne Gilson: Even if design is not accepted -as- an explanation, it is nevertheless a -fact- that needs explanation. (Cf. ""From Aristotle to Darwin and Back Again."")

A few comments on particular chapters:

In ch. 11-14, Meyer discusses alternative theories to Intelligent Design. He relates how difficult it has been to come up with a self-replicating molecule. This is only part of the problem, and a fairly minor one at that, as far as the theory of evolution is concerned: If evolution were true, we would need not only a molecule that can self-replicate but also one that can undergo mutations and still self-replicate in mutated form. (And be capable of still further mutations itself.). This is a much greater problem than asking for self-replication alone.

In ch. 14, Meyer discusses ""the RNA world"" approach, and his criticisms of this approach all seem sound. I do think, however, that he should have put in a word or two about retroviruses. I don't think his arguments falter on account of this, but it would be good to discuss them for the sake of completeness.

In ch. 16, Meyer discusses his argument relative to Dembski's Explanatory Filter. I do not think this helps his argument: Anyone who accepts Dembski's Filter accepts the concept of intelligent design along with it. I would be hard pressed to imagine anyone saying, ""Well, now that you put it that way, Dr. Meyer, I have to agree with you"" due to appealing to Dembski's approach. On the good side, Meyer shows that his basic argument, an argument to best explanation, is compatible with Dembski's approach, and not dependent on it.

In this chapter, Meyer also makes a number of good, strong points to address the issue of ""junk DNA,"" which is sometimes put forward as an argument against Intelligent Design. Yet, I think he could also make a more direct response: even if ""junk DNA"" really were junk and nothing more, this would not explain why the DNA of known usefulness has the high degree of structure and information that it has. If someone were walking in a city and saw a pile of rubble, the remains of a demolished skyscraper, he could say, ""What a pile of junk,"" but this would do nothing to explain the skyscrapers standing around it. If I see an elaborate, baroque painting surrounded by a wall that is so plain it seems to need no explanation, even so, I still need an explanation for the painting.

Why 4 stars instead of 5? Three reasons: 1. I found the book too long-winded. Some things could be said in a shorter, more incisive way. Most readers will probably need a lot of perseverence to make it all the way through the book, and I hope that they do not flag in their reading before they get the whole outline of the argument. 2. Although his argument does not rely on Dembski's Filter, I come away with considerable uncertainty as to whether Meyer regards Dembski's filter as a test or as a criterion. I am inclined, with some reservations, to allow Dembski as a test, but certainly not as a criterion: there are manifestly things that are designed that do not exhibit ""specified complexity"" in the sense of the Filter. 3. In the early chapters, Meyer seems to be a little too concerned with his own place in the development of this approach. One could simply note that many very prominent theories that are now accepted met with considerable resistance at first and leave it at that. I am not saying that Meyer lacks modesty in his comments, even in those pertaining to himself, but instead that some of what he worries about in the initial chapters is not worth worrying about at all. A real scientist, or anyone really seeking the truth, should not worry about his reputation. Trying to find the truth, and live up to it, gives us more than enough to fill our attention.",37
Theoretix,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Debate where scientific certitude is still without a clear definition of Science,"Stephen C. Meyer's 630-page `Signature in the Cell' raises the 20-year Neo-Evolution vs. Intelligent Design debate to the next level. Meyer ignores the Creation (`Young Earth Creation') and the Hybrids (`Progressive Evolution'/'Old Earth Creation') debaters, and focuses on:
1) Substantiating the underlying 'natural philosophical framework' within which the Evolution-Intelligent Design debate continues
2) Providing a historical view on how thoughts, scientific processes and authority changed during the past 200 years, with cursory views over the past 600 years
3) Highlighting authorities that had addressed or contributed to these multiple issues
4) Addressing multiple events (e.g., court decisions, media coverage), questions, counterpoints, cause for distortions and misrepresentations that appear all too frequently even though it would have been easy to set the record straight
5) Searching for illusive definitions for science, scientific method. This exploration is set within the rationalistic/empiricist domain - specifically within the uniformitarian mindset, to which Meyer admits adherence.
6) Providing an update on the dramatic discoveries made on the information-rich levels within the DNA, RNA, and other structures and processes.
This sixth issue challenges the scientific profession. Here, high-tech laboratory processes help uncover conditions that go beyond the energy-material - i.e. within the information-rich processes, codes, standards, automated vertical qualitative and nested structures of data-storage filing and nano-robotic processes.
Evolution's method of statistical progression (chance within a challenging environment) must experimentally address not only change factors leading to: `copies' and `adaptability', but also to three additional qualitative infrastructures where improvements, innovation (re-engineering) and invention (re-design) can be predicted and experimentally reproduced. This latter three additional qualitative infrastructures do not appear in the materialistic uniformitarian/ neo-evolutionary literature.
Intelligent Design demonstrates, that mental models must progress beyond the mechanical, organic and processive models - all the way to information models. Evolution, in order to be scientific, instead of ideological (materialistic uniformitarian) must also address information-rich programs, codes, and standards at the most sophisticated process hierarchies. It is also worth examining Dr. George Grebens' book and website`Which Ones Are Scientific'@ http grebens com, which address this issue and provides the original definition of 'science' and the 'scientific method' - that none of the debating parties address successfully. This original and historically workable definition of 'science' and the 'scientific method' clears the definitional impasse and allows both Evolution and Intelligent Design, to qualify under the scientific frameworks. Most of Meyers' book is actually an attempt to find leverage to justify Intelligent Design under the scientific umbrella. Meyer did an unprecedented and legitimate job at this, but achieved limited success, just as Evolution, based on its materialist uniformitarian and reductionist approach cannot escape its 19th century organic ideological moorings.",28
Harold R. Booher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,The science of Intelligent design,"I notice that most of the people who took the time to write a review of this book found it an excellent science book on Intelligent Design, but most of those just reading the reviews state they do not find the review helpful. I cannot understand this unless there is just an organized attempt to discredit the book without reading it from a large group of biased individuals who are only interested in stiffling any discussion that does not favor evolutionary theories for the origin of life. Such individuals must trust the faith of evolution over science in searching for truth, and as such have closed their minds to anything as thought provoking as Meyer's book. Meyer's book is convincing because it does not require a choice between faiths, or a choice of philosophical preferences, but rather provides the best science of each competing explantion of the origin of life.

I have read Meyers book and find it to be scientific (1) because it shows the details that distinguish evolutionary scientific approaches from ID science in scientific terminology (2) it describes predictions that can be practiced in the labortory to explain the origin of life with intelligent design. (3) it describes in detail fatal flaws in the science assumptions of non-ID explantions (4) it explains in scientific terms why ID provides the best scientific explantion of the orign of life we have at the present time.

Paul R. Goeller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Lucid and Thorough Argument for Intelligent Design,"Dr. Stephen Meyer has marshalled a formidable array of reasons why the presence of the biological information encoded in the DNA, RNA and proteins of the cell indicates an intelligent source. That imposing group of reasons includes the actual empirical data, the logic of the arguments and the careful distinctions that need to be maintained between evidence and the possible philosophical (or theolgical) implications of that evidence. He writes in a lucid, cogent narrative style, tracing his own personal search for the answers to the ""DNA Enigma"" which had intrigued him since the early 80s. Though he writes in a personl style he sticks to the path following ""where the evidence leads."" He carefully avoids the polemical and never reverts to ad hominum rhetoric to make his case. When he refers to other scientists with whom he may disagree on the interpretation of the data he is always respectul and he accurately represents their views in an irenic spirit. His thorough approach to the fundamental questions concerning the origin of the ""functionally specified information"" in the cell is to try each possible explanation and see if it is adequate. As in all of the historical sciences he looks at the evidence and then applies the logic of the ""inference to the best explation."" To explain the presence of biological information in the cell, he examines the hypotheses of chance (undirected material processes), necessity (natural laws), the combination of both chance and necessity, and finally purposive intelligence. After an exhaustive look at each one he concludes that the best explanation is some form of intelligence. While he acknowledges that he is a theist, he carefully avoids religious arguments or terminology. In fact, he reminds his readers that it is not what motivates a scientist's theory that matters; it is ""the quality of the arguments and the relevance of the evidence"" (p. 447).",28
Cecil Phillips,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A Significant Contribution,"Meyer has made a significant contribution to two of the great unsolved mysteries in science: the origin of life and the evolution of life forms. He uses probability theory and information theory as powerful, scientific tools to explain the inadequacy of Darwinian theory and to present a compelling case for intelligent design (ID).

The book also provides a thorough analysis of the history of evolution theories and the advances in biology since Darwin's time. It is a thorough review of the issues related to life's origin and evolution and a detailed response to critics of ID. Meyer emphasizes the science involved, not religious aspects. He makes a strong case for the scientific validity of ID, and states that ""The theory of intelligent design does not claim to detect a supernatural intelligence possessing unlimited powers.""

Serious students of evolution, no matter what their prejudices may be, should take the time and effort to read all 600 pages of this important text.",28
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Great book!,"Great book! Especially in the era of ""Stalinization"" of American science, where judge decides what is science and what is not, and journal editor can be fired for publishing scientifically correct but politically incorrect paper. The author shows, methodically and using scientific arguments, that discovering DNA ""by chance"", through shaking jar of ""primordial soup"" seems to be quite unlikely. He also provides arguments that when it comes to the origin of life, then ""this is fact not theory"" Darwinists are on the same ground as supporters of intelligent design",28
James E. Obrien,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Superb Book,"Meyer makes an extremely convincing case that biological information is, in the words of Microsoft's Bill Gates, ""like a computer program"" - intricately designed with foresight, not generated as an accident of nature. The probability of this program being developed by chance, even over millions of years, ""exhausts the probabilistic resources of the universe"", according to Meyer. Much of the book is highly technical, difficult reading for a person not trained in the relevant science, but with some effort it is revealing and rewarding.

Meyer says that intelligent design is the best possible explanation for life. Those who might be expecting hundreds of references to God will be surprised, since he doesn't even use the word until about page 442 out of 508 pages of text (not including index and bibliography). He reveals that he believes in God, but his analysis and conclusion is not based on faith alone.

While many insist that belief in intelligent design is based on ignorance, it may well be more factual that those who insist that life suddenly emerged from a soup of inorganic chemistry actually have their heads in the sand, not unlike those who used to think that the sun revolved around the earth, or pre-Newton scientists who were ignorant about gravity.

R. Carpenter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Meyer pulls the wings off the Flying Spaghetti Monster,"Meyer goes to great lengths to avoid any specific theistic arguments in this book, and in so doing largely disarms critics who seem to think a smirk and a flying saghetti monster are all that's needed to send ID proponents running in fear.

Meyer pulls back the curtain from a scientific community that finds nothing wrong with highly structured, organized, and guided experiments that attempt to demonstrate that there is no structure, organization, or guidance in the creation of life's building blocks. The irony is at once delicious, but is also embarrassing. We have nothing to fear from these folks. They will likely all end up retreating to a Dawkins-like directed panspermia. Intelligent Design is okay, I guess - as long as it started anywhere else but here.

I can't recommend this book highly enough. Grab some garlic bread and a good wine. The flying spaghetti monster is ready to be eaten.",28
Mark Bloomer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A Thorough Examination,"""Signature in the Cell"" is a powerful case in support of the hypothesis that an intelligence was behind the origin of life and the DNA code. Dr. Meyer's book includes a thorough and scholarly account of our attempts to determine how the intricate molecular structure and function of living cells came into being. The author reviews each approach in detail, and describes why it fails to offer an adequate explanation of how life could have arisen from only natural forces. Dr. Meyer does not appeal to intelligent design merely because we are unable to explain how the cell and the DNA code came into being naturally. Rather, he specifically goes to great lengths to elucidate the nature of information, and elaborate why information cannot arise from natural processes alone. The science is detailed and the logic is rigorous, yet the case is delivered in a very clear way that the lay person can understand. ""Signature in the Cell"" is a fascinating read leading to a profound conclusion, and well recommended for anyone looking for strong scientific support in favor of intelligent design.",25
John Bloom,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,This book would change Darwin's mind!,"In brief, this is one of the best books on intelligent design that I have read in fifteen years. And yes, as the academic director of a science and religion program, I've read a lot on this issue from all sides. Dr. Meyer constructs ""one long argument"" for ID, systematically explores alternative hypotheses, handles objections, and makes a powerful case that ID is both scientific and the most reasonable scientific explanation of the data. A master piece!

Required reading for all ID advocates, and their critics.",32
C. Dennis Murphy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,"A definitive work, substantial and throrough.","I've read a number of books and articles promoting Intelligent Design. Dr Meyer's book is among the best of them. It has the potential to make a serious crack in the reigning naturalistic science orthodoxy. Dr Myers arguments are well constructed and compelling, friendly in tone and gracious to his opponents. He covers all the objections I've seen in print.

His book isn't a polemic, just a thorough, calm presentation with LOTS of detail. I think it is sure to be recognized as a must-have book for any reference collection about Intelligent Design.",26
Robert C. Newman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Intelligent Design and the Origin of Life,"A nice book! Meyer, a former geophysicist with a PhD in philosophy of science, and one of the major proponents of intelligent design, has here produced what will probably be his magnum opus, pulling together a massive amount of material. He makes (I believe) an unshakable cse for a designing intellect behind the origin of life.

In twenty chapters, Meyer sketches the history behind the discovery of DNA and its properties, while interweaving a personal tour of his own interaction with the data and theorizing regarding life's origin. These chapters also include a detailed discussion of the various diverse features that characterize different varieties of science, with emphasis on the historical sciences and how they operate. He argues that design is the best explanation of life's origin by showing the weaknesses of all the other models that are currently on the table, whether these rely on chance alone, natural law alone, or on a combination of the two.

For me, the most striking chapter was number nine, ""Ends and Odds,"" which assembles a probability calculation for the formation of a modest-sized (150 amino acid) protein, in which the experimental work of Douglas Axe is sketched. It turns out that the fraction of proteins of this size with 3-D stability (as would be needed to have any real function) is only one in 10 to the 74th power!

Meyer devotes a full chapter to respond to the claims that intelligent design is not science, answering various objections and showing that the only one that doesn't also afflict naturalistic evolution is the claim that science must use methodological naturalism. This, he says, is arbitrary, and means that science is no longer a pursuit of truth in any case where intelligence has actually intervened.",31
Donald M. Minter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Maybe the world isn't flat...,"We have been told for so very long that anyone who dared to doubt the basics of Darwinian assumptions, time and random chance, was less than intelligent. Meyer's text reminds us that there are indeed intelligent alternatives to Darwinism. More alarming, as suggested in a recent Newsweek article as well as Meyer's text, is the seeming 'world is flat' rule of law that appears to threaten any scientist who disagrees with basic Darwinism. Will we one day look back and laugh at those who really believed in 'time and chance' theories, in much the same way we ridicule those who believed the world was flat? Great read for those not afraid to think outside the box.",32
Gerald L. Martin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,God's Existence is Proven,"Proving that God exists is impossible but Stephen Meyer presents the most scientific evidence for intelligent design. His writing compels reasoning beyond common scientific or political statements to help one to understand the depth of being for the creator of life. One can study this as a textbook to understand DNA. human genome,transmission of information and other basic formulations of life. It is not an easy read; rather it points to a possible new, exciting opportunity for a younger generation to develop (evolve) engineered processes to enhance future lives for humans.",25
J. Friel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A reference book for intelligent design,"In making his case for intelligent design, Dr. Meyer separates ID from the various arguments that try to confound it with creationism, and evolutionism, while not denying the theory of evolution and its processes. I am not an expert in biochemistry, but my knowledge of molecular biology was greatly increased after reading several of the chapters in this book. If you already know molecular biology, you can just skip them. The author goes to great length, literally, to derive ID theory and establish it as a better explanation for the origin of genetic information than competing theories. He also refutes many arguments that are commonly offered against it. This should be a reference book for the theory of intelligent design.",29
David B. Clotfelter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A Game-Changing Examination of the Origins of Life,"Two features make this book extraordinary. First, it is lucidly written, so that even a person with a relatively weak background in biochemistry, statistics, and the history and philosophy of science should be able to follow the argument with ease. There are technical sections written for experts, but Meyer always warns the reader in advance and suggests ways of getting the thrust of these sections without becoming bogged down in detail. Meyer is an highly gifted writer, with a rare ability to make complicated matters clear to the ordinary reader. His diagrams are also extremely helpful.

Second, the book is remarkably thorough. Meyer explains the information content of DNA and the structures of the cell in great detail, shows the mathematical improbability of such information arising by chance or by the influence of natural law, considers numerous proposals to explain the origin of life and shows why each has failed, makes a case that intelligent design does provide a good explanation of the information in DNA and in cellular structures, answers common objections, and lays out a number of research questions raised by the design hypothesis, including several that have already borne fruit.

Along the way, Meyer also introduces the reader to key issues in the effort to define science, and brings much clarity to those issues. This is significant, because one ploy used by those who would exclude intelligent design from consideration is the claim that it is not science. Meyer demolishes this pretense.

I believe this book is a game-changer. Because it is so well-written, it will be widely read. And because it is so thorough, it will put an end to most facile objections to Intelligent Design. It won't end the debate, but it will force it to a higher level, because critics will be unable to to ignore Meyer's lucid, sophisticated, and powerful argument. If you plan to read one book on the origin of life this year, it should be this one.",32
Standbayou,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Fascinating & well-written argument,"I read the book on vacation and was impressed. Dr Meyer makes cogent arguments for his intelligent design (ID) perspective without descending into personal attacks against those who disagree. His discussion of information theory was particularly enlightening, the highlight of the book.

Overall I thought Meyer made a good case. He even included a dozen predictions generated by ID, which should make for interesting discussion a few years from now!

Is he right? Well, time & further research will tell. What is clear, though, is that his arguments are based on empirical evidence, not theology or the Bible. Despite the claims of some, the intelligent design put forth here is definitely a scientific hypothesis. Those who wish to refute it should do so with counterarguments based on evidence, not ad hominem attacks.

Signature in the Cell is readable, informative, and generous in crediting the work of great scientists such as Watson and Crick. The design hypothesis is daring, but has some, possibly growing, empirical support. Whether you love or loathe ID, this is a book worth reading!",38
B. Baker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,"Well done, Dr. Meyer","First, I must say that I was a product of my government education that could only teach that the complex organisms we see around us are the fruit of natural processes given enough time to produce what we observe today. For many years I was comfortable with the Darwinian paradigm and yet what I found was unnecessary complexity, symmetry and non-functional beauty in the world that was not explainable through the prevailing scientific model. This means that modern scientists must deny what they actually see and exchange these truths for implausible explanations so that they can protect their model. It is no wonder that many of the scientists who have reviewed the book are slamming the science because the concept of a designer cannot be accommodated by the current scientific model. This isn't a problem with science; it is, at its core, a problem of honesty. And as the movie Expelled revealed, ID presents a genuine threat in the academic world because it would jeopardize grants, cause retractions and add a branch to the science department that it knows nothing about - something outside of nature - something supernatural.

Dr. Meyer demonstrates that he is no scientist wanna-be. His thorough research and analysis are only matched by his sound reasoning and, although there are profound implications to his conclusions, he has been honest enough to say that which has heretofore been covered over with gibberish. Dr. Meyer proves that he has the capital to go thought-by-thought with modern academia and does so with humility and clarity. This is an excellent read and I would highly recommend it. Clearly, as evidenced by all those who are taking shots at the book, the time was perfect for a work of this caliber.",41
Bill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Searching For The Truth,"""Signature in the Cell"" is a very powerful book written by Dr. Stephen Meyer. He searches for truth. His basic goal is to walk the high road and simply review the origin of life mystery using the science of biology with assistance from probability mathematics. His book also reviews the history of Darwin's work addressing natural selection, along with gene mutation unknown by Darwin before his death (Neo-Darwinism).

Neo-Darwinism is now considered as fact by a number of scientists/academians and has now been extrapolated by some to explain the understanding of how life originated and evolved into all species, including the human species with an immaterial intellect. Darwinian theory for a number of biologists explains all biological life through an evolved, undirected process via. space, time, and chance.

Meyer notes at the beginning of the book how natural selection starts after cell replication, but points out it doesn't provide an explanation for solving the origin of life mystery. Meyer identifies this mystery at the beginning. He notes that ""evolutionary theory could not explain the origin of the first life because it could not explain the origin of the genetic information in DNA"". As a result, he weaves through how the DNA works in building proteins, the information stored (specified information) in the DNA, the history of design, and clues to causes. Then, he eliminates chance as an answer for determining the origin of genetic information in the DNA to build a minimal cell, as well as elimination of self-organization and RNA world hypotheses for solving the origin of life mystery.

Then, Meyer explains that the informational arrangement of bases in the DNA is a language to construct proteins and is best explained by intelligence, not chance, self organization or RNA hypotheses. He compares the intelligence theory with other origin of life theories. As a result of this comparsion, he argues that the intelligence theory provides ""inference to the best explanation"" (IBE) above all other origin of life theories. This is how Darwin argued for the superiority of his theory of natural selection over other theories. The IBE for intelligence is powerful, as it shows that only immaterial intelligence can properly arrange the genetic information to construct the proteins for developing the first cell. It will be interesting to see if anyone can develop a better IBE. I believe Meyer has put together an IBE for the origin of life that threatens the foundations of biological science as we know it today.

Meyer then discusses the definition of science and how it is made into a moving target to satisfy the Darwinian establishment in court and academian settings for eliminating other theories such as intelligence. Actually it is amusing to see how this works. To think the Dover trial was settled by using the term ""methodological naturalism"" to place a science definitional barrier between immaterial information and materialism. How convenient, yet amusing. Darwinist are simply playing games and not searching for truth, which for me as an engineer is puzzling.

Meyer completes his book by showing the explanatory power that the theory of intelligent design exposes. For example, he explains that junk DNA is not really junk. He states: ""The discovery in recent years that nonprotein-coding DNA performs a diversity of important biological functions has confirmed this prediction."" The intelligent design theory opens up a completely new area of research not provided by Darwinists.

In summary, the ""Signature of the Cell"" and the information it provides, calls for biologists to explore a new scientific area, rather than just the ""old"" Darwin area, which explains little or truly nothing about the mystery of life. I placed a written note on the last page of the book that reads: ""It seems after reading this book that Intelligent Design theory looks much more sophisticated and complex than Darwin's. In fact Darwinism looks antique and behind the times."" Meyer has written a book that is ground breaking and will be around for some time to come as foundational. Those interested in the Darwinism vs. Intelligence debate should definitely read this book; and if they do not believe immaterial Intelligence can be used in science, refute the IBE provided by Meyer. I really doubt if anyone can, because I believe it is ""Truth"".",32
Donald Hank,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,In the beginning was the word,"[...]

Darwin easily showed that evolution happened on a macro level, using the development of the dog as an analogy.
But had he known whag Stephen Meyer knows about DNA, it would never have occurred to him that the cell evolved by accident.

Meyer makes 4 blockbuster points:

1 -- The message in gene expressino is actually a true code. It is language, it is words. Although in both DNA (original data repository) and RNA (data transmitter), it is in the form of nucleotide triads (called codons), the constituent nucleotide bases constituting the code have no special chemical affinity for the proteins they signify in the code (just as ink has no meaningful chemical affinity for paper that would make certain letters stick to certain parts of a page), so the processes of recognition, transcription and translation involved in making a protein are pure language utilization processes, not chemistry! That makes the ""recognition"" part quite unobvious and esoteric, requiring a deciphering system that is not based on the chemical properties of the constituent parts (against initial intuitive hypotheses), so that the message borne by the code is independent of any recognizable physicochemical laws-making it a mystery. This fact alone points unequivocally to a designer who started his process with the use of words.

2 -- Meyer also makes the point that the protein synthesized by this system (as all proteins in all living cells -- even the simplest -- are) not only could not exist without the DNA but the DNA could also not exist without the protein (because both the protein and the DNA are both part of the protein synthesis machinery and ""software"" essential to the manufacture and maintenance of cell constituents). Thus, unlike the chicken-or-the-egg question, there seems to be no way either could have come first. That makes evolution a very tough sell indeed. (One could actually speak of an ""evolution delusion"" to paraphrase Richard Dawkins).

3 -- Besides the living cell, there is nothing known in nature that encodes, decodes, transmits and reads specifications and builds or reproduces machines (living or other) in this computer-like fashion. The only scheme that resembles this enormously complex machinery and computer system is man-made and requires a designer. The designer is logically the default explanation.

4 -- Meyer's colleague, statistical mathematician William Dembski, calculates that the probabilities of the simplest cell producing all the necessary proteins it needs to survive by chance is 1 in 10 to the power of 41,000. This probability is so small as to be utterly negligible. In other words, the advent of life on earth was not an accident.

No one who reads this book can come away believing in the standard academic explanation that life came about by accident. Neither, claims Meyer, do many microbiologists and/or origin-of-life scientists, who are either ""baffled"" or are on his side.
Please note the anger on the part of the Darwinists who can't think of a cogent argument against this.
They still have all the money and prestige, but universities are laying off staff. Maybe they should try some humility and admit there are things they don't know.
And the more they learn, the less they know.",27
T. Small,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Stephen Meyer is amazing.,"Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design Stephen Meyer brings to light the truth. This book shines through all the brainwashing, power-hungry evolutionist garbage out there that hides and overlooks facts to sell their product. Think Richard Dawkins. Even look up the ""Dick-to-the-doc"" video on youtube... totally hilarious yet scarily true. So I have learned and embraced the fact that inside every cell in my body, amazing little factories and processes are happening that just could not have evolved by chance from a pile of dirt. That fact alone should turn every atheist into at least an agnostic, because SOMETHING created us, and with magnificent beauty and order. I did not believe in a God until 3 years ago, and now I read every book I can on the scientific breakthroughs that support an intelligent designer... everything opposed to this worldview is full of lies.",26

Just like a highrise building there has to be a blueprint and it has to have a designer behind it. They cannot have been drawn up by themselves or happened one nucleic acid at a time. One cannot have a living being without all the pertinent details happening in the right order and connected in the right way, all at the same time. It is enormous complexity upon enormous complexity with special timing. This book clearly spells that out and, unfortunately, flat-worlders out there, refuse to see beyond the horizon of their cellar windows. The criticisms have been mostly personal, biased attacks, not educated discussions--just as the attacks have been toward me, my work and my family and toward others who dare to question whether the Darwinian emperor is wearing clothes.

RandScholar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Building Blocks to Understanding the Complexity of DNA,"This book is outstanding! It is written objectively and balanced, for the layman to understand, but once you have read it, you will have far greater understanding of how complex DNA is, and how impossible the creation of life by ""chance"" is, than anyone who professes to be an evolutionist.

Each chapter of this book is a building block to the next one, and ultimately to knowing how DNA is structured, what information it contains, and how even in the simplest of cells, DNA requires hundreds of proteins to process its information. As Prof. Meyer states: ""Indeed, although the information in DNA is necessary for building proteins, many proteins are necessary for expressing and processing the information in DNA. ... Building such a cell also would have required other preexisting components.""

Prof. Meyer's critics must resort to character assassination because they have no alternative realistic scientific explanation for how cells are created and function. No longer may they wow us with their stories of life bubbling up from the primordial soup of a warm pond during an electric storm. To believe that theory now requires much more blind faith than I could ever have.",27
Brendan Dixon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,"Calm, well-reasoned, and thorough","There are kids today who cannot imagine life without the Internet and iPods. Many adults do not remember a time when computers did not exist. We take information technology for granted; it forms part of how we see the world. Yet, Darwin, Huxley, and those who built the original evolutionary edifice worked before computers, before information science was even a theory. Neo-Darwinism dressed up the original arguments with information-theory colored lipstick, but failed to deeply consider the implications. Meyer's book tackles those head on in a fair and balance manner.

The few negative reviews of Meyer's book do not list a single concrete instance with which they disagree, but instead hide behind the well-worn (and unhelpful) cries of ""rehash"" and ""creationist."" Meyer, on the other hand, takes great pains to make a very calm, well-reasoned argument from the best available evidence. Far from a ""rehash,"" it is nearly 600 pages of in-depth material covering the full history of the search for the origin-of-life. Only through an a priori elimination of possibilities can anyone reduce Meyer's work to a ""creationist tract.""

What we now know about information-theory completely changes the origin-of-life game. If our science is to based on evidence, especially the evidence that vastly exceeds what Darwin ever imagined, that which Meyer raises must be thoughtfully considered and its implications factored into our search. We may not like what has been found, but that does not change the evidence.",45

The science is strong - I was amazed to realize how little the evolutionists really have to go on other than smoke and mirrors. The first chapters deal with probability theory, and there is a lengthy chronology of major scientific discoveries/issues which have been brought forth by both intelligent design and evolutionary camps. I think the book could have been more concise and a little less lengthy, but it is definitely worth reading.",27
An Embryologist,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Expanding Research Horizons,"For me, the most fascinating part of Meyer's book is its epilogue, ""A Living Science."" Neo-Darwinism's reliance on mutations to provide raw materials for evolution has led to an over-emphasis on DNA sequences as the repository of information for embryo development. But biologists know that there is heritable developmental information elsewhere in the fertilized egg. In the epilogue Meyer argues that a design perspective encourages research into important aspects of embryo development that are presently ignored or minimized by a neo-Darwinian approach.",27
MICHAEL M. BAKER,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,The Truth is always the Truth,"I have almost finished reading Dr. Meyer's book and find it interesting and informative. I find it typical his critics here in Amazon cry foul and resort to name calling. I also find that some of the criticism apparently has been leveled against the book by folks that have not read it. But, seems these days when the truth is sought and discussed by a scientist in a scientific manner, the subject trumps his credentials. Too bad.

""Signature in the Cell"" is many things; a history lesson on DNA and origin of life research, a layperson's guide to understanding the basics of microbiology, coupled with more detailed explanations in the appendix for readers so inclined, the best treatment of necessarily limited abductive reasoning required to study origin of life matters that I have read, and finally a lengthy, by necessity, argument for I.D. that soundly identifies the flaws in the three major theories by materialistic science:
* Chance Hypothesis
* Self-Organization and Biochemical Predestination
* The RNA World
* A fourth, perhaps, if you count the combination of Chance Hypothesis and Self-Organization and Biochemical Predestination as a unique theory

In all these Dr. Meyer uses biology, math, logic and the opinions of many notable scientists on both sides of this issue with equal regard. His technique is sound, showing harmony between the various branches of the scientific community in his arguments and where proponents of ""non-organic to organic"" life scenarios have changed their minds when overwhelmed with the facts, facts that are becoming more and more plentiful as our technology improves.

The honesty and integrity of this work is impeccable. No position pro or con to Dr. Meyer's premise is treated in any way other than respectful and fully accounted. Unfortunately not so his critics here.

If your world view is so entrenched that you cannot bear to read an excellent, entertaining, and informative book, then you are so much at the loss for that. Even if you strongly disagree with I.D., reading this book should make you think about your position, even to the point of making you angry......and if does that, please be honest enough with yourself to know why this book has made you so uncomfortable.

We humans seem to chafe at the truth when it is disagreeable, but you know what? Even if we do not accept it as truth that does not make it any less true, only you are less informed and at a loss for not taking advantage of a learning experience.",43
Sioux Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Signature in the Cell,"Meyer's Signature in the Cell is spectacular. His presentation is calm and complete. His critics are desperate.

What is the real motive behind the suppression of an alternative scientific theory regarding the origin of life? The suppressors would claim that this is not the case, as Intelligent Design theory is not really science at all, but religion masquerading as science.

That claim is a two-edged sword: Inherent in atheistic materialism is a belief about God, even though it is that God doesn't exist. There is no way to prove God doesn't exist; this belief must be taken on faith. Beliefs about God that must be taken on faith are essentially religious beliefs. Could it be that those who so vehemently oppose ID are not really defending objective, religion-neutral science? Their intense zealotry suggests that what they are really doing is desperately defending their own atheistic religious beliefs.

Contrary to the mistaken assumption of many, science is not restricted to that which affirms atheistic materialism. Authentic, religion-neutral science seeks out the truth wherever the evidence leads it, regardless of whose religious/philosophical ox will be gored by its doing so.

Yes, science should look for natural explanations. Nobody is disputing that. Intelligence is known to be a reality. To deny that is only to confirm its absence in one's own instance. There exist phenomena for which the best explanation is an intelligence. The Lascaux cave paintings are an example of this. It is certainly not unscientific to attribute to an intelligence these prehistoric images of animals on the Lascaux cave walls.

It is abundantly clear to all reasonable people that those caricatures are very unlikely to have been arrived at by mindless chance. If it is very unlikely that a simple caricature of a prehistoric bear is a mindless accident, it is entirely reasonable to assume that it is even less likely that an actual living instance of the bear is a mindless accident. Yet it is claimed that the only ""scientific"" view is that complex biological systems came about mindlessly and accidentally.

Science can quite legitimately question that view and remain true science; in fact, it must allow that question to be examined if it is to remain true science. It is a distorted science perverted by religious atheism that hysterically rejects the legitimacy of this scrutiny of the likelihood of mindless, lifeless matter accidentally assembling itself into complex biological systems. It seems an intelligence is required just to get a simple sketch of such a thing.

What if the simple truth is that it is not only the image of the bear on the Lascaux cave wall that is the work of an artist, but the actual bear is, too? To scientifically determine that that is most likely the case would be, to understate it, very momentous. If this can be done, scientists should be allowed to do so.

Yes, this determination would not surprise the vast majority of humanity who already consider it a ""no brainer"" to conclude that life on Earth is the work of a divine Artist. Even so, to scientifically assess the likelihood that an intelligence of some kind is responsible for life on Earth is an incredibly interesting, truly scientific endeavor. Religious atheists, as well as theists, should let science gather the evidence and then follow it wherever it leads. Those confusing their religious atheism with ""science,"" of course, vehemently claim such an investigation would not be scientific.

A final thought for theists who object to a philosophy of science that is completely religion-neutral: If God is the author of nature then ultimately there can be no real conflict between true religion and true science. That is why theists should have no fear of a philosophy of science that is devoid of a religious agenda (that is not the same as being devoid of values), and it is also why many devout atheists have conniption fits when religious atheism's corruption of science is questioned; to them it is an assault on their most deeply held religious convictions. If they want to pretend their religious beliefs are ""science"" that is fine, but this perversion of science must not be imposed on the rest of us.

The case made for intelligent design in Signature in the Cell is true, objective, religion-neutral science. It is momentous indeed.",29
M.C. Travis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Sensational,"I'd like to preface my review by stating that yes, I do have both an educational and professional (genetic research) science background. I am currently earning a graduate degree that strongly involves the subject of origins.

Dr. Meyer's masterpiece, Signature in the Cell, is the best work I've read on the subject of intelligent design. From the very first page, his writing style captured my attention, and I found myself unable to resist reading just one more page, and then just one more after that...

Although I purchased this book for the purpose of a graduate school science course, it definitely didn't feel like ""work"" while I was reading it. Dr. Meyer's passion, knowledge, and honesty shine brightly throughout the book. The argument put forth is presented in a comprehensible and interesting manner. I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone, even those who may not have a science background. You will not be disappointed, and you will come away with a fresh perspective on this controversial subject.

I am so pleased that Signature in the Cell is receiving increasing attention and acclaim. It surely deserves it. Pay close attention to the content and tone of the negative reviews; I guarantee they haven't read past the preface, if they even own the book at all. It is, however, quite entertaining that they feel the need to bother commenting, isn't it? :-)

Bravo, Dr. Meyer. I look forward to what comes next!",30
E. Aagaard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO READ THIS BOOK,"Climategate is about climate scientists who didn't want the public to know A. what the raw data were, and B. what some of them were doing with those data on the way to their conclusions.

Signature in the Cell is written by a scientist who wants the public (that's you and me) to see the raw data of cell biology - so that we can make our own (informed) judgment about some current issues in science.

K. D. Brown,4.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,The detail is there if your interested and fair minded.,"I thought Dr. Meyer's book is a helpful balance of his own thought journey and scientific detail. I appreciate books that are thoroughly annotated, as this is. I have a technical and scientific background and found most of the technical material very helpful and intelligble. The technical material isn't an easy read, but the author warns you before hand.

This topic is complex but not impossible. There are many people who are heavily invested in either side of this set of arguements. For my money, its is increasingly clear that technical evolution (not the obviously true propositon that living organism adapt to thier surroundings) is shot through with theoretical and evidential problems. It is as if microbiology is more like the practice of archeology. We are discovering micro machinery and micro factories embedded is living organisms. If the SETI effort had found what is being discovered in the cell, I think the pronouncement would be ""ET has been found!"". In my thought process I am wrestling with the how the evidence points to a single Architect versus Gaia.

ID isn't madness, or cloaked Christian fundamentalism though there are obvious implicit implications in this type of effort. I recommend the book highly.",35
Bob Wallace,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,strong argument for intelligence in life's origin,"This book uses philosophy, biology, and math - no Bible. I am about half way through the book and find so far that Meyer has been quite careful in his origins analysis. Its done in an engaging first person way...lot of scientists efforts reviewed. He shows the fascinating structure of DNA and how proteins are assembled from the DNA code. That is nicely illustrated in the video of that assembly available at the web site [...] (and you don't have to buy the book to see that).

He challenges presently accepted life origins thinking by focusing on biologic information and argues carefully that chance (all time and interactions allowed) and necessity (physical laws) cannot account for information in the core of every living cell.

I'm off to read the rest but I bet his arguments will stir up an angry buzz of defensive attacks by the committed evolutionists because if life's origin has an intelligent agency, the foundation of evolution crumbles.",27

Dr Meyer has examined all viewpoints for and against Intelligent Design and has not confined himself to ""punting"" only his point of view. He has thoroughly analysed opposing views and exposed their misunderstandings and mistakes.

Frank Perry,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A Simply Must Read Book - Stephen Myer is Great,"This book in great detail simply shows that Intelligent Design is the only viable explanation for life on earth. It goes into great detail on the subject, leaving little room for argument. Clearly written with enough explanation to hold up to the always expected harsh critics of ID. One has to question the motives of those negatively critiquing this book, the more credibility a book has toward ID the more negative criticism it recieves.

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Interesting,Makes you wonder about science's objectivity.

Neil Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Dr. Meyer Accomplishes What the Evolutionists Have Not,"In his three phased approach, Dr. Meyer, in ""Signature in the Cell"", accomplishes what the evolutionary scientists so far have avoided. Using personal reflection, historical recollection, and Darwin's own method of reasoning, he lays out the case for inferring that intelligence was responsible of the complex digital code and programming in the cell. He examines all the current origin-of-life theories and shows that they are all lacking. They fail to answer the fundamental question: Where does the information come from? Citing the fact that the only known source of the complex, specified information that is found in the cell is an intelligent agent, he concludes that indeed, an intelligent agent was responsible.

So far, in the popular books and on-line articles I have read, evolutionary scientists only make assertions that evolution is true and they use metaphysical arguments to back up their claims (No self-respecting designer would design something - some perceived imperfection in biology -- this way). They never really explain how the evidence they cite (the fossil record, genetic similarities, etc.) leads to the conclusion that the Darwinian mechanism can accomplish what is claimed for it. Evolution has to be true according to their worldview.

Dr. Meyer recognizes the limitations of writing for a general audience and he exercises much care in explaining complex topics in way that most educated people should understand. His book is very readable and informative, even if you start out (or end up) not agreeing with his conclusions. Having said that I do recognize that there are parts that may be more difficult to understand -- I know there were for me.

Even though Dr. Meyer concentrates on the question of the origin of information in the first cell, the same question is posed with respect to evolutionary history as well. Only when evolutionary scientists answer the question of how new information is created at the origin of life and how it is interjected throughout the history of life will they have solved one of life's most fundamental mysteries.

I highly recommend this book!",33
Curtis Hrischuk,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,comprehensive review of the history and science around the origin of life,"The title is misleading, although catchy. The book is a comprehensive review of the historical path that brought us to our current understanding of how life began. There are some very good contributions here, of which its readability is the strongest -- there is nothing in this book that is scientifically difficult to grasp. The historical account is accurate, as far as my prior understanding goes. The scientific material is also accurate, although I would have appreciated side bars that provided more depth.

For those people who are acquainted with the history and philosophy of Science, the material in the book will come as no surprise because it exposes how time has not been kind to origin of life theories that were thought to be very strong.

For those people who do research in this area or are employed in the 'origin of life' industries, the book will be tantamount to propaganda. Unfortunately for them, the material is accurate so they need to adjust their worldviews and work to the facts rather than the theories which do not match the facts.

Let the discerning reader pick up the book and make up their own mind.",27
A. Hainline,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Powerful Arguments!,"Having read various pro-Darwinian evolution books, I believe that the scientific establishment has not been able to refute or even to adequately address the arguments Meyer puts worth. There simply are no adequate explanations for how the ridiculous amounts of biological information could have arisen from purely naturalistic mechanisms. More importantly Meyers puts forth a comprehensive set of positive arguments for design - showing that ID really is much more than just arguing from ignorance. This book is well worth the read!",29
Samuel M. Randolph,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Setting a movement on its feet and on its way,"Written in a clear and economical style with the hitting power that a seasoned debater brings to his work, this is a book that anyone who wishes to gain a solid update and reference tool on DNA and the emerging ID movement will want to own.

In my own research to understand the massive and complex mechanisms of neuroplasticity that make human handedness reversals possible in children, and many years later, a return from that state in adults, I have been driven to look at Intelligent Design as the best possible explanation for this phenomenon Hidden Handedness.

Meyers opens up a world of understanding that is largely closed to the public, by producing a work of synthesis and argument that is as powerful as Darwin's, and one that is based on current science. Meyers has produced a game changer, a book that can win minds and energize a lasting concensus.",57
D. Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Irrefutable scientific evidence for ID,"A fantastic book that clearly answers expressed objections to ID as science. It presents arguments in a very readable form, in a journey that considers the known speculative scenarios from chance to necessity (law, biological predestination, self-organization, etc.) for the origin of the information in life The biological details and complexities are presented in a manner that can be followed and appreciated by most people. Meyer builds the case that ID is real science, based on empirical evidence and established scientific principles (and supported by peer-reviewed literature). He also makes predictions of findings that would support ID.
For me, there was little new technical information increase, since my recent book (Probability's Nature and Nature's Probability: A Call to Scientific Integrity) covered much of the material. I didn't see any errors or misrepresentations. I did find the transcription process a fascinating read, with the tRNA, mRNA, and ribosome details (with numerous proteins involved). The book also gave me a new appreciation for the philosophy of science, and a clearer framework for historical science (e.g. abductive reasoning).
Only those philosophically opposed to design would be able to dismiss the clear scientific evidence that design is the only reasonable cause of life's complex specified information. This book is a ""must-read"" for anyone within the debate.",59
Upright BiPed,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,A Balanced Look at the Evidence,"Stephen Meyer has done a masterful job in Signature of the Cell.

I'll not try to sum up this book, as I am certain that other reviewers have already done so admirably. All the accolades being presented here for Dr Meyer's book are completely merited. The discovery in the 1950s that Life is the result of encoded information makes it implicit that there is a symbol system and rules behind that code. This has been proven in discovery after discovery since then. Living tissue is replete with rules-driven systems which are not purely reducible to physical laws.

This is what the brilliant polymath Michael Polanyi referred to as ""boundary condition"" in the jounal Science back in the 1960's. He stated ""Mechanisms, whether man-made or morphilogical, are boundary conditions harnessing the laws of inanimate nature, being themselves irreducible to those laws. The pattern of organic bases in DNA which functions as a genetic code is a boundary condition irreducible to physics and chemistry"".

You see, its not that this information has been unknown, it is that it has been ignored. That is the beauty of this book. It is a serious and learned look at the current state of knowledge on the subject.

Meyer's book is balanced, thoughtful, and provocative. It is the very definition of a ""must read"".",35
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Great Teaching Resource!,Dr. Meyer is a wonderful researcher and articulate teacher. The concepts that he lays out in this book are easily understood. He deftly puts complicated DNA science into a format that even a layman or high school student can comprehend and visualize. Specified complexity when fully understood reveals how really simplistic and shallow evolutionary thinking is. Evolution is not science. It is just stubborn refusal to admit one could be wrong. I will be ordering several more copies of this book for distribution at local high school libraries. Thank you Dr. Stephen C. Meyer!,31
Gregory J. Scalzo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Best book on the origin of life to come along in years!,"Dr Meyers has accomplished what is often diffcult to do in a book on science. In Signature in the Cell he has successfully presented a complete and detailed scientific analysis of the origin of life issues, but in a way that is understandable and fascinating for the layman. Anyone reading this book is really getting a college course on all the different factors involved in the origin of life research and debate. From the ""big picture"" to the wonderful details of cellular activity, Dr. Myers paints a full canvas drawing on microbiology, science history, statistics, and logic. I have a degree in Chemistry from NYU and I have found Dr. Meyer's analysis not only sound but captivating-- I could not put the book down. And I have recommended Signature in the Cell to my family members and friends, some of whom have no science background at all. This book is certainly a challenge to those who have narrowed their focus into just believing in chance and mutation as an explanation for why we are here. And anyone who reads this book will walk away amazed at the overwhelming evidence for intelligent design.",32
Darwin Researcher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,a goldmine of information,"This book contains a goldmine of information in 612 pages and almost 100 pages of notes and references. Meyer, who did his PhD in the origin of life area at Cambridge University, effectively deals with many of the critiques of Intelligent Design in a very readable but convincing way. The many diagrams included are very helpful in communicating to laypersons the complex ideas involved in the origins controversy. Meyer covers the many failed attempts to produce life in the laboratory, including the Miller-Urey experiment, and shows that the design of life leads to one conclusion, intelligence. He also covers the question ""is ID science"" showing that the word science is now used to distort the debate, not by proving ID erroneous, but by excluding it from the discussion. My favorite definition of science is ""science is what scientists do"" but the historical definition ""the search for, and synthesis of, empirical knowledge"" is more specific. As to predictability, Meyer also gives several examples where ID had made predictions that turned out to be correct. No doubt some of the material in this book was from Meyer's Cambridge PhD thesis rewritten in first person and in laymen's terms for this book. The opponents of ID will, no doubt, attempt to respond to this trailblazing work and all I can say is I wish them luck because they will need it. The book also gives much history of the ID movement found no where else, and an excellent response to the many false claims about the movement. No one can claim to be informed about ID without reading this excellent book written by an insider.",185
D. D. Orr,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,"""Signature"" is a balanced scientific treatment of the origin of life","Meyer gives both sides of the argument for the origin of life, Naturalism/Materialist vs. Intelligent Design. As a philosopher of science, he describes in historical context how different branches of science apply the scientific method. He explains how Origin of Life researchers, being part of the ""historical sciences"" (as opposed to the ""experimental sciences"") use abductive reasoning and a process of ""inference to the best explanation"".

Meyer's work is carefully documented and, while he describes the change in scientific point of view over the last several centuries (design to naturalism), his book isn't a screed against evolution and Neo-Darwinism. The book is heavy with biochemical detail but doesn't require the reader to be an expert in biology as he leaves many of the technical details in the book's appendices. Meyer teaches well and the book features many of his own informative diagrams and illustrations.

The basic premise of ""Signature"" is that every living cell is an information processing system of ""specified information"", the genetic data encoded in DNA. He considers the major naturalistic explanations for the origin of life and demonstrates how they fail to account for the extremely high threshold of functional information content for even the simplest living organism. Meyer then makes a reasoned case that design is the best explanation for the specified, functional information present in living cells. He makes the point that such information is the exclusive product of intelligent design by comparing the cell to modern information processing systems.

Meyer's book is far from the creationist propaganda that his detractors claim that it is. As a Christian who came to accept evolution by reading Francis S. Collins' excellent book, ""The Language of God"", I highly recommend Stephen Meyer's book, ""Signature in the Cell.""",35
M. Bentley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Excellent read,"Stephen Meyer does an excellent job of detailing the history of science with respect to the cell, and its parts, and moves on to show how its extremely complex design can not be explained by Darwinian evolution.

Edward N. Caldwell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Science At Its Best,"Darwin himself stated that if either the fossil record did not reveal gradualism or if anything could be identified within the complexity of life that could not have come into being through a series of minute beneficial changes then his theory would fall. Interesting that whenever anyone attempts scientifically to address either of his challanges,they are immediately branded ""Creationist"" [see many reviews above]! Meyer's book is difficult to get through because of the great detail of his scientific evidences. Note that his detractors do not attack his science [they apparently can't]. so they attack his motives or world view. This book is a Masterpiece and is a challange to those serious enough to take up the debate as to whether or not the code of life could have arisen by naturalistic processes -- even Dawkins, in unusual candor, admits that it could not have. Bill Gates has said that the DNA code of life for the simplest cell far transends everything that Microsoft has done since its inception. Meyers shows in meticulous detail how not only the chemistry of life but the coded information of life is beyond naturalistc explanation by thousands of orders of magnitude. No wonder the Darwinists who rely on his theory to justify their materialistic world views are so upset by his findings. Take up the challenge and argue with the scientific conclusions of Meyers, Gates and Dawkins, but don't belittle yourselves by only shouting ""Creationist Deception!"" This book changes the dimensions of the debate and is a gauntlet thrown down. I am eager to evaluate any cogent rebuttal -- anyone??",39
o'Godel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design,Fascinating insights about DNA and the Probability dilemma.,"Absorbing Reading! How many of us knew how complex DNA and RNA really is? Today many of us are familiar with computers and software - yet amazingly the DNA/RNA relationship is shown to be more fascinating and complex. Stephen Meyer carefully walks us through fundamental concepts of probability and information theory. This kind of text book is rare - resorting only to cold facts and logic with the understanding of probability and statistics, it becomes clear that we are talking about information and information processing - strangely like a computer system. And that means one thing - Design. This book is cold hard facts and logic - no mention of God or religion except in passing. Bill Gates is quoted here as saying ""DNA is like a computer program"" p.385
What is disappointing are the reviews on this board, clearly made without reading the book (and without actual evidence) - seems to remind me of another theory! :)
Signature... should be mandatory reading in all schools whatever your belief or theory on life's origins.
I am a computer software engineer and software quality engineer who has looked at this subject for many years. Dr. Meyer's angle and lucid explanations are compulsive reading and a clear threat to the ""religious"" dogma of current evolutionary theory which remains a competing theory to Design.",37
John Duncan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Molecular and Genome Evolution,A brilliant and masterly account of molecular evolution,"Dan Graur has written a masterly account of molecular and genome evolution, and I expect to be getting more and more from it as I re-read and refer to it. As anyone who follows his blog Judge Starling (dan = judge in Hebrew, graur = starling in Roumanian) will know, he is not someone to be discreet about his opinions. His often expressed contempt for the ENCODE project, which cost around $300000 to arrive at the claim that the great majority of the human genome is “functional” makes his blog worth reading for that alone.

As well as explaining protein, nucleic acid structure, mutations and so on in the early chapters, Graur explains in some detail how phylogenetic trees are constructed from molecular data., describing, for example, the simplest method, UPGMA, as well as others such as the widely used computational method, CLUSTAL.

He is not frightened of giving the mathematical basis for his analyses, and assumes that his readers will not be, either. It would be an exaggeration to say that the mathematics is trivial or very simple, but little of it should be beyond the reach of readers who make the effort.

I was particularly interested in his calculation that if 80% of the genome is functional, as claimed, then each of us must have at least 30,000,000,000,000,000,000 children if the population is to avoid collapsing from lethal mutations. As he rightly says, this result is “bonkers”, but there is nothing wrong with the calculation, so the starting point cannot be right. He believes, as I do, that most mutations are neutral, and that the human population can easily avoid collapsing from the genetic load represented by the few that are not. I had read of this calculation in his blog, and I was anxious to check that it was in his book, as I wanted to refer to it in a book of my own.

From time to time Graur injects some sly humour into his presentation. He refers to a class of DNA that he defines Lazarus DNA as rubbish DNA that is mutated to functional DNA, saying that the name comes from “the second most famous resurrected corpse in fiction”.

The only fault worth mentioning is that Graur sometimes shows wrong structures for amino acids and nuceic acid bases: when he first defined an amino acid he said that it contains an amino (-NH2) and a carboxyl (-COOH) group, but that is impossible, because these two groups cannot coexist to any significant extent. On the facing page he has a table showing all the common amino acids in correct ionized forms, but a couple of pages later we are back to uncharged structures, as we also are later in the book. If this were a biochemistry textbook it would be a serious error, as one cannot understand the properties of biological molecules without understanding the ir structures. (A generation or two ago most biochemistry textbooks exhibited the same failure to understand ionization, but today it has largely disappeared.) However, Graur is not a biochemist, and the fault can perhaps be forgiven in a book in which the points being made do not require correct structures.",9
Don Churchwell,5.0 out of 5 stars,How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction,"If really want to know about de-extinction, read this book!","I'm not a scientist, or a member of academia, but I did enjoy Jurassic Park. Dr. Shapiro has produced an accurate picture of where we are, and what we can expect to see in the near future regarding de-extinction. (Some of her predictions were announced by George Church's group at Harvard just last week!) She presents some terribly complicated information, concepts, and challenges in a way that most people can understand. This is not a dry textbook. This is also not a headline-grabbing, breathless prediction of herds of mammoths running amok in Siberia, or skies darkened by thousands of passenger pigeons. It's an honest look at a fascinating subject.

What I found most interesting was Shapiro's thoughtful examination of the ethics of all this. Once we decide we could do this, should we? Should we devote literally piles of money to recreate creatures that may have no place to live? Would this time and money be better spent looking into why some creatures went extinct, while others thrived in the same environment?

If you want to learn about de-extinction, buy this book. If you want a read that will entertain you and force you to think, buy this book.

Best of all for enhancing direct understanding of de-extinction, she writes not as an outsider or journalist but as one of the scientists in the thick of the new field inventing itself.

Raman,2.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Genomics,Not very pedagogical,"As a newcomer to the biological sciences, I found this book not to be very pedagogical. From the very beginning, it assumes too much knowledge to be really self-contained - I was forced to Google terms (like Alu, an important transposable element in the human genome) that were left undefined from almost the very first page. And it's not that the level is uniformly too high for me, as it rehashes things like the central dogma of biology that are familiar from grade school. The purpose in this age of buying a paper book is to have something self-contained enough to avoid having to go down a long bunny hole of Internet searching. I found the uneven assumed background to be disappointing.

Its pages are full of colorful boxes containing relatively unhelpful summaries of the main text and over-numerous digressions. But there's enough new material in these boxes to make them necessary for understanding subsequent text, so you can't skip them. Thrashing between the text and these boxes slows me down. Many of the illustrations are non-essential photographs or poorly cropped screenshots.

I Teach Typing,4.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Genomics,Well written but for biologists,"Because I do biostatistics for a living and it has been decades since my last formal biology class, I got this book to help me understand the biology of modern high-throughput genomics research. I am impressed with the writing. The author's presentation of history and the framing of ethical issues could not be better. Unfortunately for people like me the author assumes that you have a background in molecular cellular biology. Many terms are not defined or defined long after they first appear. Because the writing is excellent you can usually read through the sections with undefined terms with the help of the web but it is a slow difficult read. The index is good but there is no glossary. The web support for the book is fair (with expanded graphics and answers to some problems) but not really great. There are questions that are supposed to be answered using the web (like how the field has grown since the book was published) but the publisher does not provide hyperlinks to support those questions. With a glossary for non-biologists and better web support this would be an ideal book for everyone interested in the field. Without those features, it is still very good.",10

Gavin Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,Molecular Biology: Principles of Genome Function,"An awesome ""central dogma"" book.","I'm comparing this book (MB) to Molecular Biology of the Cell (MBoC), which is probably my favorite textbook of all time.

This one (MB) is not as much of a general cell biology book as it primarily covers only the elements of the so-called ""central dogma"" of molecular biology. DNA replication and transcription into RNA, and RNA translation into protein, plus all the regulatory aspects of those processes (as well as chapters on the cell cycle, DNA repair, transposable elements, and genomics), unlike MBoC which spends more or less the first half of the book on those topics and then devotes the second half to the further biology of the Cell, covering things like membranes, energy conversion, cell signalling, cancer, and the immune system.

Both books do a good job of introducing the Biochemistry you need in order to understand what follows. MB has a great first chapter that gives an overview of the book (basically ""Molecular Biology in 30 pages"").

Where MB shines though is in its more in-depth coverage of the topics it touches on. It devotes about twice as many pages to these topics as the current edition of MBoC does. MB is also wonderfully illustrated and does a good job of visually explaining things. MB contains lots of ""experimental"" panels that talk about how various aspects of the cell were discovered.

Both books include chapters on techniques for manipulating the genetic material in cells. I thought the current edition of MBoC felt slightly more up to date, but both books are very current editions with a good overview of the current state of the art.

Both books are quite readable. I would give the edge to MBoC here in terms of ease of reading as MB seems just a bit denser to me. But both are very easily understandable.

I can highly recommend this book (MB) to anyone looking for an in-depth coverage of the central themes of molecular biology (how DNA and genes work). It goes pretty deep for a first course, but it does not presume much of any background knowledge so it would be an appropriate book to introduce someone to the subject who wants to understand things very thoroughly.

If I had to choose only one or the other I'd still prefer the new MBoC edition due to its much broader coverage of cell biology (it's also 50% larger and twice as expensive though), but this one is really excellent at what it covers. I bought it after previewing the ""Look Inside"" pages and I have not been disappointed.

If the mechanics of the functioning of cells interests you then you'll probably be fascinated and really enjoy the depth of knowledge you gain from this book, and it's something you'll want to keep and probably use frequently as a reference if you progress further in the study of biology. If you find the details tedious, then this one might be more depth than you want, and something like Essential Cell Biology, 4th Edition might serve you better.

Currently this book is not available as a Kindle ""Print Replica"" e-textbook yet, where the other titles mentioned here are.

Really happy with the book, easily a 5+ star experience.

Occasional Reviewer,5.0 out of 5 stars,A First Course in Systems Biology,The Best Introductory Text in Systems Biology,"As someone who has been working in systems biology since before the term was even coined, I can be pretty critical of any nascent texts on the subject, now that academic biology departments are starting to give the field its proper due. But part of the problem in the field, all the way back to May and Morowitz, is that the obscure and esoteric mathematics of dynamical systems theory has been inaccessable to most classical biologists, let alone to the public. Fields such as bioinformatics have made clear the importance of mathematics and computational science to biology, but the world of modeling and simulation has remained on the edges of biology only until recently.

Most texts on systems biology have tended to focus on the mathematics without much more. Here is a book that tries something rather bold, to address the whole expanse of systems biology, with a minimalist mathematical approach, and a more a practical perspective on real world application. If you are a biologist looking for a first look at systems biology that does not assume you dream in Lyapunov exponents, this is the book for you. It is well illustrated with an almost historical context providing perspective on the field and just enough math to pique your interest without scaring you away. If you fancy yourself a Ramanujan, there are a number of great books that dive into the mathematical abyss with abandon, such as Armin Fuchs' text. But if you are new to the application of dynamical systems theory to biology and to mathematical and computational modeling of the same, then this is your ""start here"" users manual road map for the more partiuclar detail you will need once you are hooked. This is the perfect book for an introductory upper division undergraduate or preliminary graduate course in systems biology.",22
systems_biologist,5.0 out of 5 stars,A First Course in Systems Biology,An Exceptional Book!,"This is a powerful introduction to systems biology from one of its internationally recognized leaders. The book presents the origins, concepts, tools, state of the art, and future directions in systems biology research. One of the book's many outstanding features is its real emphasis on both ""systems"" and ""biology."" On one hand, it highlights the principles and general advantages of the systems-oriented approach and mathematical modeling in (molecular) biology. On the other hand, it shows how concrete biological questions and phenomena (from cellular signal transduction to heart physiology) motivate and drive modeling research. The book's other features include its accessibility, balanced and highly relevant selection of material, highlights of the connection between modeling and experimental data, and suitability for audiences with mathematical or biological backgrounds. The reader can also choose between more introductory or more advanced levels of exposition. For example, Chapter 5 ""Parameter Estimation"" is a helpful reference even for a seasoned systems biology scientist. Yet, Chapter 6 ""Gene Systems"" starts with a description of the basic building blocks of life and then proceeds to discuss current experimental methods of gene expression analysis. Several areas addressed in the book have been advanced by the author's own research, which obviously adds to the book's overall value. While the book is mainly focused on deterministic finite-dimensional systems, it conceptually prepares the reader to use other computational frameworks to solve biological problems. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in systems biology.",13

JoeT,2.0 out of 5 stars,Exploring Bioinformatics: A Project-Based Approach,It's more a lab manual than a book,"Disclaimer: I was asked (as a person with 12-years experience in bioinformatics) to review this book for a colleague as a favor. This is the exact commentary I'm giving to her.

First off, do NOT buy this book if you want to self-teach yourself bioinformatics!!
This is a lab manual, not a textbook!

Comments:
1. This is not a textbook, but more of a laboratory manual. While I applaud the individual chapter projects, the explanations as to the bioinformatics being used are very limited, and in some cases, difficult to interpret. Heck, I do this stuff all the time and even I was getting confused. I believe that this book can be used in conjunction with classroom assistance, but not for standalone learning.

2. There are instances where comments are made regarding the ""instructor resources"". Well, if you are like me and not ""an instructor"", then you miss out on whatever the instructor has for available information and you are stuck. Additionally, there were errors in the book, but the website appears to have caught none of them.

3. If you have read any book on computing, it's not unrealistic to see ""click sequences"", such as ""click->click->click..."", where you click from one page to another to get you to some page. This book does not do any of this. You are given a set of instructions that take you to (what you hope) is the page you are supposed to land on, but because there are absolutely no screenshots in the book at all, in some cases, I was unsure if I was on the page I was supposed to be on.

4. And, when you get to the page you think you should be on, they ask questions. Be prepared to not look in the book for many answers. Again, I expect this in a lab manual with an associated textbook. However, with absolutely no answer key to selected questions (especially in questions asked in the body of the text relating to some sort of search), you have no idea if the answers you come up with are correct or not. Namely, you will associated references (read: the internet or another book or specific bioinformatic software resources).

5. Have some knowledge of molecular biology before you read the book. I'm not sure the target audience, but I found it odd that important information is included at the end of the chapter rather than the beginning. Maybe that's just me.

The projects are good though, but the interpretation of the specific bioinformatics output is totally lame. Why just run something, get output and then just ""leave you there to fend for yourself""?? To me, for a book that costs over $150, that's totally unacceptable.

Conclusion: Not a good book overall, though it does have it's moments. If you are interested in bioinformatics and want to learn the web components, use Bioinformatics for Dummies. Unfortunately, as all things bioinfo, it's dated (from 2007) and you need to do a bit of work to get everything working (most stuff does), but the explanations are first class. And, it's 1/5 the price. (PS: There is a 3rd edition coming soon, or so I'm told). Also, bioinfo is still pretty much perl-centric, though you do find python being used more. This book uses pseudocode, which is not the way to learn (you miss out on specific bioinfo packages like bioperl), which is kind of useful to have your hands around.

Dr. Terrence McGarty,5.0 out of 5 stars,Epigenetics,Fantastic Introduction to Methylation and Epigenetics,"Epigenetics by Armstrong is one of the newer additions to the field of literature on epigenetics. The focus is mostly on methylation and there is some coverage of miRNA and lncRNA but not a great deal. The presentation is superbly structured and it assumes just a reasonable understanding of genetics and embryology.

The book is written as an introduction but covers the field in considerable depth. One of the strongest points is the graphical presentations which far exceed any of the other recent texts in the area. The graphical presentations present the complexities of epigenetics quite well.

The book starts with DNA architecture including the functions of the histones and then moves to methylation and acetylation. It discusses histone modification in a simple and straightforward manner.

The discussion of epigenetic gene control is quite well done and flows very well from the prefatory discussions.

The author also presents the issues of imprinting and the embryological changes in methylation patterns. These issues are critical in understanding embryological development and ultimately stem cell dynamics. There is a discussion on the reversal of methylation which is quite useful.

The author then discusses several disease states and the impacts of methylation.

Overall it is a superb book and one of the best introductions I have yet to see.

However there are few observations. These are not negative but they reflect the state of the art in epigenetics.

First, there are many hesitant conclusions. This is just the nature of methylation effects. Many things are known but many factors are still to be understood. The author makes certain these hesitations whenever they occur.

Second, on the cancer side, it would have been quite interesting to have delved a bit deeper into an example such as Myelodysplastic Syndrome, MDS, which is a methylation disorder and is initially treated as such. MDS is the result of methylation of certain gene segments which result in excess blasts. The initial treatment is demethylation therapeutics. Considerable work has been done here and it would have been a useful exercise to have added it.

Third, epigenetics can be considered as any epigenetic mechanism that controls gene expression. Thus miRNAs and lncRNAs and other siRNAs may have been of use to understand in detail. As such the main focus is methylation. There is a putative interaction between the two and perhaps that could be explored in a second edition.

Overall this is undoubtedly the best text on the market at this time and it does a sterling job at methylation. It is useful for both grad students and those seeking to understand this area but who are well founded in the basics.",8
Clarence Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Epigenetics,Excellent for A College Class,"An exceptionally well-written college-level text that is accessible for college students with a freshman-level knowledge of genetics. As Armstrong details, epigenetic mechanisms are not just another gene regulatory layer but ""a versatile mechanism by which the information content of the genome can be used in a selective manner to define cellular phenotypes and respond to environmental influences that cells experience during their lives."" Thus, epigenetic mechanisms can be viewed as nature's interface between DNA sequences and the organism's outside environment, which provides the organism with a necessary degree of phenotypic plasticity not afforded by the rigid (but more faithfully transmitted) DNA sequence. To his credit, Armstrong only briefly introduces the controversial topic of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, that is, Lamarck-like inheritance of acquired characteristics that has excited a few evolutionary biologists (e.g., Jablonka and Shapiro). Our knowledge of this possible transmission of acquired information is too scant to give it much more attention than is given by Armstrong. Moreover, where such transmission exists, it does so through reproductive systems that show tremendous species variation. That means what epigenetic transmission of acquired information one finds in plants or C. elegans, for instance, is not necessarily what one will find in mammals.",3

Jose I. Miranda,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics,A MUST HAVE IN BIOINFO...,"Hello everybody:

This book was beyond my expectations. Really, the best buy I did on bioinfo stuff. It’s worth each penny for each of its more than 900 pages, full with good information and basic material.
If you are serious on learning bioinfo, you gotta buy it.
As bioinformatics grows at a high-speed rate, it’s almost impossible for published books to keep pace with it. For example, the author has good material on microarray, a must for the time of the publishing of the book (2008/2009). In spite of a still usable technology, it is loosing terrain to the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, that come up in 2007 and is now showing good results; NGS is really a turning point on the genomic and proteomic subject.
So, don’t wait anymore, just buy it!

The text does not always flow - as if different sentences from different sources were thrown together without transition. As the text does cite many papers, this is acceptable. However, a review and small edits to help with the flow would make the book better.

Daniel MMM,3.0 out of 5 stars,New Biology for Engineers and Computer Scientists,Lots of information,"The book has a lot of information on molecular biology accessible to anyone with an electrical engineering or computer science background, very much what the title advertises. (I just don't quite get the ""new"" qualifier for ""biology"" in the title). A big positive of the book are the assignments at the end of each chapter. They are built to make you go out after more and explore further resources available on the subject (mainly web based), and these are very nice indeed if you are using the book for self-study. Another big positive is that the authors make lots of referencing to using the web-based KEGG database, and that is very helpful and neatly done. Negatives are: the text sometimes is a bit confusing and difficult to understand, presenting too much information all at once and treating everything too superficially. The authors presented some topics very clearly for an engineer, but as for others you have to have some 'good' grasp of chemistry and molecular biology to understand. Also, there are lots of typos that make you feel like the editors wanted a book with a very nice presentation (the book looks very nice) but didn't care much about proof-reading. Figures are also confusing at times and are ""recycled"" here and there. Nonetheless, you can usually figure out what is wrong and what the authors wanted to say. In brief, it is a book with a nice presentation, lots of information, many references, nice assignments and one can learn from it, but it gives you the feel that they could have worked a bit more on content.",1

This is important because somehow they are all connected with each other in a complex way.

The only negative point is, that it is poorly written. I guess this is more the fault of the publisher then of the authors because they accepted it as it is. A new edition would certainly profit by a thorough review. Nevertheless, a very good book one can strongly recommend to non-biologists.",4

Ethan Bienstock,4.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods,This textbook does an excellent job developing the mathematics and providing intuition behind SVMs,"This textbook does an excellent job developing the mathematics and providing intuition behind SVMs. That being said, This textbook assumes you have a firm grasp on vector calculus and linear algebra. Chapters 1 and 2 provide a good overview of how machine learning can be used in classification and linear regression. Chapter 5 is an overview of what is covered in most introductory multivariate calculus classes. However, chapter 3 and chapter 4 are not easy. If you lack a background in real analysis you can read the first four or five pages of each chapter and get a basic idea of what is being discussed. Some of the proofs could use a bit more explanation, but at the same time they are mathematically rigorous and concise.

Lastly, the author makes mention that you can read the book out of order. Here's the order that I read: chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 5, chapter 3, chapter 6, chapter 4, chapter 8, and then chapter 7. I think this order gave me enough background information and motivated me to delve into the mathematical theory.

Sandro Saitta,4.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods,More for mathematicians than computer scientist,"This book introduces the concepts of kernel-based methods and focuses specifically on Support Vector Machines (SVM). It is hard to read and a good background in mathematic is clearly needed. The book has a strong emphasis on SVM starting from the very first line of text. Concepts are well explained, although equations are not clear. The notation doesn't facilitate the reading at all. The book covers linear as well as kernel learning. The kernel trick is well described. It is easy to understand ideas behind SVM while reading the corresponding chapter. Finally a small chapter on SVM applications is proposed. Unfortunately, it only contains typical SVM applications (i.e. standard problems).

I think this book is good if you:

* Have a strong mathematical background

* Work in the specific domain of SVM (or kernel-based methods in general)

* Want to write a research paper about SVM and need the correct notations

However, this book is NOT intended for people who:

* Don't like to read theorems, corollaries and remarks

* Are not interested in reading hundreds of proofs

This is my personal opinion as a computer scientist: this book is definitely written for mathematicians.",36

Norbert Haupt,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,This Changed the Way I Think about Humanity,"There are seven individual women, who lived between 10,000 years ago and 45,000 years ago between the Middle East and various areas of Europe, who are the direct ancestors of 95% of all European people alive today. Yes, exactly seven women. I am European, so I am likely the direct descendent of one of those seven individuals.

The author Bryan Sykes is a professor of human genetics at the University of Oxford. He has done pioneering work in genetics, specializing in studying mitochondrial DNA. One of the striking attributes is that the mitochondrial DNA is not passed on by males, only by females. Therefore, my personal mitochondrial DNA can be studied and compared with that of other contemporaries. When Sykes did this, he discovered that all modern Europeans pretty much belonged to one of only seven “groups” or “clans” as he calls them. Studying mutation frequency and the base mitochondrial DNA, coupled with the anthropological record, he was able to determine that there were seven specific women that are the mothers of all Europeans.

He then traced further back into our African roots and found one single woman, who lived about 150,000 years ago in Africa, who is the mother of all human beings alive today. He calls her fittingly Mitochondrial Eve.

Sykes writes The Seven Daughters of Eve for the non-scientist, but he goes through great pains to describe his research, the steps he went through to come to his conclusions, and the various scientific hurdles he had to jump. The book reads like a detective story, and I had trouble putting it down. After he makes his scientific points, the muses about the lives of the seven women. How might they have lived, what were the conditions of their lives like, how did they spend their days?

A number of negative reviews challenge details in Sykes' conclusions, and the way he builds his ""case"" in this book. I found his excursion into Polynesia very helpful, because he used the simpler scenarios there as a vehicle to introduce me (who is not a biologist or geneticist) to the subject. After the Polynesia story, I was ready for Europe.

I also enjoyed reading his fictional musings about what the lives of the seven women may have been like very helpful. I haven't studied anthropology, and I felt like he was sort of holding my hand and showing me what he speculated. It gave me visuals to work with.

The roots of our human existence, our history and our unique humanness became alive for me as I read this book. Many times I was caught in reveries, dreaming about the lives of my ancestors. I was overwhelmed by the immense time periods that have elapsed, and how very unlikely our human existence actually is. 45,000 years represents about 2,000 generations. I know my grandmother. That’s three generations. However, my grandmother’s DNA comes from one of the seven daughters of Eve, 2,000 generations ago.

The book may not work for scientists. It's not a textbook. But I don't believe that's what he tried to write here. I wanted to popularize the subject of mitochondrial DNA to laymen, like me. And that's exactly what he did.

The Seven Daughters of Eve inspired me on many levels and has enriched my life. I will never think about humanity the same way again.",4
David R. Childree,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,THE story of mitochondrial DNA analysis by the first authority on it,"This book serves as an excellent introduction for the non-scientist to how mitochondrial DNA is used to determine maternal lineage. No prior knowledge of DNA is required. My formal education in cellular biology ended after my Biology 101 course in college, and I had no problem following Sykes at any point. The discussion is largely limited to mitochondrial DNA, which is Sykes' primary line of research. Y-DNA is discussed briefly in one chapter, and autosomal DNA analysis is not discussed at all.

As others have commented, Sykes does indeed have a talent for explaining complex concepts in layman's terms. He tells the story of his research and discoveries in a chronological format that reads like a detective story - which, of course, it really is. His search for the secrets held in our DNA is very captivating. I found it hard to put the book down, even when I was very sleepy.

Some have found the seven chapters of what I will pre-historical fiction (they read like Clan of the Cave Bear or Quest for Fire) to be annoying or to distract from the scientific discussion in the other chapters. I disagree strongly. I found them just as captivating. Sykes uses them to explain some of the major technological advances of pre-historic man, such as flint working, hunting techniques, the making of musical instruments, and agriculture. Those like myself who are not thoroughly familiar with human pre-history find these chapters particularly informative.

I will add that those such as I who hold strong religious beliefs will not find anything offensive in this book. Unlike some recent scientists-turned-evangelical-atheists such as Hawking, Sykes is not out to convince readers that the fact of human evolution proves that religion is superstitious nonsense. (This, of course, would be an unintelligent and scientifically invalid argument that would distract from Sykes' primary discussion.) To the contrary, he implicitly acknowledges the important role that human spirituality played in pre-historical life, particularly in his descriptions in the seven afore-mentioned chapters of such things as a hunting ceremony and ceremonial burial.

I highly recommend this book for those who are interested in either genetic genealogy or human pre-history.",2
Brian Hogan,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,Must Read for those who see non-mechanistic origin for humanity.,"The author is clearly in step with his scientific peers on evolutionary origins, though he has frequently upset their apple carts in a number of other areas of settled opinion. However, I loved his writing style and ability to allow the non-DNA expert understand some of the most complex things in creation (yes, I said the C word). I was continually getting fresh insights into the incredible details of what happened in Eden. I was in awe to discover that God created mitochondria before man and separately. This was the ""soil of the Garden of Eden"" - the ""red earth"" that God used as material for Adam (literally Adam's -and our)- Mother Earth --- in terms of mtDNA) and then God put in yDNA when He breathed life into Adam---literally become his Father (and ours!). There is so much more here if you are not starting from a point where one explanation --- Intelligent Design --- is off-the-table and outlawed. I would love to see what Bryan Sykes would come up with if he went over all he has discovered while allowing I.D. as a possible origin explanation. It is a wonderful book. The story of us all.",1

I've been hooked on Sykes ever since. I have a well worn paper copy of this book purchased new just after it hit the bookstores way back when.

Stefanie,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,An easy to read genetics book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which was a total surprise. If you had told me a few weeks ago that I would be devouring a book about mitochondrial DNA and its role in tracing human evolution, I would have laughed. But this book is extremely easy to read. Sykes' narrative style, which includes a discussion of the complicated science of genetics but framed in stories of how he has used science to solve mysteries, makes it very easy to follow what he's saying and to actually learn about this exciting area of science.

I loved the research projects he discussed in the first part of the book, including testing the Romanovs and exploring the origins of native Polynesians. I agree with a friend of mine who also read this and thought that the book is actually *less* interesting when he gets into the hypothetical biographies of the Seven Daughters themselves.

But overall, I have been recommending this book to everyone I know. It even came in handy as I was at a discussion group focusing on the topic of intelligent design, and I was able to speak intelligently about what I'd learned about human evolution through Sykes and his research.",7

WendyBG,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,"Educational, Evocative and Entertaining","Of the many science books I have read, very few have been as well-written and sheerly entertaining as they have been educational.
In ""The Seven Daughters of Eve,"" Bryan Sykes broadens the view of human evolution, tracing migrations through time and around the globe. His descriptions of the discovery and his defense of the paradigm shift of using mitochondrial DNA in anthropology are clear and easy to understand.
The heart of the book is the fictionalized reconstruction of the lives of the seven European ""clan mothers"" discovered by mitochondrial DNA analysis. Mr. Sykes weaves stories of the day-to-day struggle for survival of women at different points in human history. The stories are evocative, and connected me with the actual women more than simply reading ""25,000 B.C."" would have done. I enjoyed the stories very much. I only wish that Mr. Sykes had footnoted which of the objects mentioned in the stories had actually been found by archaeologists.
I loved Mr. Sykes' use of the word ""feminine"" to describe the traits that have nurtured and supported human survival. This book is an antidote to superficial definitions of femininity.
I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in human evolution. I would especially recommend the book to women who want to feel a closer connection with their fore-mothers.",10
Imperial Topaz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,Reads Like a Thriller�Hard to Put Down,"If you are interested in the origin of human genetics, or are just an armchair amateur scientist, you will find this book reads almost like a ""thriller."" I had trouble putting the book down, and read it in two days. Sykes is one of the cutting-edge geneticists, yet is able to explain all concepts easily and clearly for the layman. As a teacher, I really appreciate this.
This book is partly the story of the genetic discoveries, and partly Bryan' story of how those discoveries came about through a series of chances in his life. So there is both science, and human interest. Sykes also explains historical assumptions that other scientists have made, and why those did not work out, previous to the new discoveries.
There was only one part of the book I did not enjoy as much, which were the chapters devoted to the hypothetical lives of the various seven ""clan-mothers."" This part is not science, merely conjecture. However, I can see why he included them-to give a CONCRETE example of how their lives would have existed, and how they were just some of the many women living at that time. However, the other women's mitochondrial DNA, for reasons clearly explained, did not get passed down to Europeans.
The book focuses primarily on both the complicated story of European ancestry, and the solution of the previous mystery of South Pacific ancestry. But the best thing about the book is that he winds up by providing a discussion of the ancestry of the whole world, and gives a detailed map about how, where, and when all of those branches came out of Africa-as well as mapping the branches we know from Africa today.",15
Belle Cat,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,Read the first half,First half of book on contemporary genetic tracing of human history was very interesting and valuable; the second half describing various scenerios for the prototypical mothers of Europeans was tedious and a bit silly,1
Jennifer B. Barton,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,Fun Book - Easy to Read - Thought Provoking.,"Not being a scientist, I thought that I was in over my head at first - he starts off about finding the ""Man in the Ice"" and then how he had been involved in getting DNA from very old bones (a few hundred years old) and then how he ended up doing mitochondrial DNA research in the Polynesian Islands. Though I could understand what he was saying, I couldn't see how they related to each other or why he mentioned them. He pulls them all together brilliantly though as each activity did eventually have something to do with his mitochondrial research in Europe.

He fully explains (in a dumbed down version, I'm sure) for us regular folks what he did, what he found and what significance it has. In fact, I got so interested that I devoured the book within three evenings (fast for me). The conjectural fiction of the lives of the seven women were actually a small part of the book, just a few chapters in the back. The last chapter speaks of the world at large and the other clan mothers briefly (there are 26 others if you consider the whole world). Some of those concepts, or specifically their ramifications, are very interesting also and I would love to see more on them. In particular, how all clan mothers tie back to one ultimate clan mother and, given the results of the study, that there can not possibly be anything truly fitting the modern conception of separate ""races"".

Fun book. Easy to read. Thought provoking.",2

J. Canestrino,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,A well written story and a good introduction to genetics.,"As a plant breeder and seed production consultant, I often look at plants, but think about the genes. I bought this book because it deals with how mitochondrial DNA was used to trace the lineage of human 'clans'. In onions we use a system of male sterility that relies on the interaction between genes in the cytoplasm (in the case of plants, mitochondria and chloroplasts each have their own DNA)and genes in the nucleus. I found the technical portion of the book very informative and a good explanation of the matrilineal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA. What suprised me was how well the narrative was written. The story flows well, it is even suspensful at times. The chapters at the end of the book, the fictional section on each 'clan mother', are interesting and fun. I highly recommend this book. Though it may not be for everyone, if you have ever looked at a layer of sedimentary rock along the highway and wondered if (and where) it was seabed some time in the past or if you have ever wondered where your own heritage lies, then this book is for you.",6

He is able to trace European DNA to seven women, seven Clan Mothers!

He was clearly a man trying to discribe the lives of women. For instance,most women would know that a baby does not get milk when it first suckles. He is also so much of a modern man that he leaves out the spiritual dimention. Ancient people were no less complicated than ourselves and had a mystical sense of their world which is shown in their cave art. It is thought that this was connected with Shamanistic religious practices. Sykes takes the easy way out and treats it as mere hunting magic. He portrays twins as an inconvenience. My guess is that they would have been seen as a double blessing from the great Goddess of Life. Even Neanderthals were able to nurture injured and elderly members of the community and keep them alive past their economic usefulness. My guess is that twins would have been cherished instead of one being killed as he suggests.",6

I wish he'd write one specifically about Germanic heritage (he's written a few about England).

H. Paul Greenough,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,Worth the Read,"This book is worth the read because: 1) It is a clear, accurate depiction of the accuracy and limitations of using mitochondrial DNA in tracing human migrations over tens of thousands of years; 2) It shows how mitochondrial DNA achieved this position, overcoming strong initial resistance from the scientific community; 3) It is a well-written account by one of the key researchers in the field; and 4) It shows DNA from the Y chromosome confirms the evidence of the mitochondria and offers similar possibilities for tracing paternal ancestors.
The book finishes with imaginative biographies of each of the seven ""daughters"". Interesting enough, but if that's what you want, you might be happier with something in the Clan of the Cave Bear series.

Bryan approaches what can be a very dry technical subject in a concise, entertaining way. He's quickly become one of my favorite authors.

Many have complained that the second portion of the book is not as good as the first. I'm referring to the section where Mr Sykes speculates on what the lives of the seven clan mothers must have been like during their time. Personally, I enjoyed this portion of the book, but be aware it is a departure from the tone and subject matter of the first part. It's also a departure from the science of genetics and heredity and more of an attempt to ""flesh out"" the characters of the clan mothers.

My main criticism of the book is that it is EXTREMELY Euro-centric. All the hype around the book suggests that everyone on earth today is descended from one of the seven clan mothers... when in fact it would only be accurate to most Europeans are descended from one of the seven.",4

This book is a self-indulgent treatise that is full of 'I did this & I discovered that' statements including a recount of how the author feuded with a peer and a former co-worker. The last half of the book is a series of seven fairy tales made up by the author regrading the women to whom all Europeans can purportedly trace their ancestry.

Lessons learned for me: this book had no bibliography, no footnotes and no attributions. Pretty astounding for an author who claims to have been published in peer reviewed scientific journals.Were his editors asleep on this one?

The chapters on the lives of the various ""daughters of Eve"" are a bit contrived and seem out of place in a book that is really more of a popularized science narrative. The rest of the book is good, a fast read and somewhat lacking in scientific details as it was obviously intended to be.
While others who have written reviews here think that this will shake some people's faith in the Bible, I find that it fits squarely with Biblical history with the exception of Syke's time lines, which, of course, are based on his extrapolation of mutation rates within the mitochondrial DNA. In having my interest piqued, I have done more checking and have found out there is recent work showing much faster mutation rates than used by Sykes for his chronology, which, in essence, compresses the time frame much further than asserted in the book. Sykes does not mention any of this work, although it has been published since 1997. Evolutionary biologists are mystified by these results, but there are those of us who are not surprised at all.",7

Animo,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,Fluff & Wander,"This is NOT a well written book. Sykes throws in all manner of non-related commentary which has no bearing on the science of DNA. The last two chapters I didn't bother to read because it's shear speculation about the lives of these early women, and personal views on how DNA research has changed his perspective on genetics. It is written to entertain middle-school interests.

What really got me was his admission that as an experienced traveler he couldn't pack blood vials sent from Polynesia to Britain without breaking. And he rents a motorcycle to tour an island without having any experience on one, promptly breaking his shoulder! In several places demonstrates his lack of common sense plain stupidity.

His history recounting is the standard line out of the universities and is very dated. The continual reference to inhabitants arriving over the Bering Straight when research indicates otherwise does not impress me for his credentials.

Sykes is insistant that males do not pass on their maternal genes. The only person in my immediate family tree with curly hair is my father's mother. I passed it on to my first daughter, along with red hair. There are other characteristics that derive from the maternal side both in my father's mother and mother's mother that have appeared in my two daughters. Sykes makes no explanation how this is possible with respect to his discussion of mitochondrial DNA. Clearly several things are left out in his presentation.

The book contains maybe 10% real useful information about DNA research and development. The rest is fluff. If you're looking for an intelligent, informative, detailed presentation of how DNA testing is done and the results of worldwide efforts, this is not the book to read. It doesn't even make for entertainment.",12

The end-of-chapter exercises are genome browser based and can be used for individual study or as part of lab exercises in the classroom. The varied topics of the exercises should be of interest to biotechnology and health sciences student alike. While designed to be a practical ""how to"" book, it also deepens students' understanding of fundamental molecular biology and genomics. A real gem!",1

Tony DaBoney,5.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),Gateway into the world of R,"'R in a Nutshell' is the essential introductory book on R. Do not try to learn R without it.

I made two attempts to learn R before purchasing this book. In both previous attempts, I had to abort and use another tool to solve my problem because it was taking me too long to accomplish very simple things in R.

The reason R is hard to learn is that its documentation is organized for statisticians that already know R, but have forgotten a detail or two. There are a few other books on learning R, but they are setup like a college course - complete the entire book and THEN you can actually accomplish something.

R in a Nutshell allows you to get working immediately. Simply lookup what you need to do. The firsts thing I did was load a file and make a histogram. I found that stuff in the section on ""Loading Data"" and the section on charts. In no time I was making stacked area charts for cohorts. Now R is an essential tool for me - and I haven't even taken the time to learn it well! With this book, I don't have to. I can learn as I go. So I actually use R.

Do not R without it.",78
I Teach Typing,5.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),Programmers vs Novices,"If you have programming experience and you want to understand how R works at a fairly deep level this is a wonderful book. If you are a novice that is just trying to learn how to visualize and analyze data there are better choices like A Beginner's Guide to R (Use R) or search my Amazon profile to see the learning R listmania list called ""Learning to use R for statistics and graphics"" or Amazon's ""So you'd like to..."" guide called ""Learn R for statistical programming and graphics"" (sorry they will not let me post the hyperlink here).

I teach programming, so I found the references to how R differs from languages like LISP, C and JAVA very useful. However, those distinctions will be at best distracting or more likely horribly confusing to programming novices. With that distinction in mind, this book is exceptionally well written and has great clear explanations on things that are missing from practically every other R book (like the distinction between if else and ifelse. Other sections, like the coverage of graphics can be found elsewhere but require you to distill a LOT of other books.

If you want to really understand R start here and then go for John Chambers books (especially Software for Data Analysis: Programming with R (Statistics and Computing) ). If you want to learn how to use R for data analysis get Zuul's book then follow my learning R guide.",3
Glenn Richards,4.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),"Clear, and well written","This book is an introductory guide to the R statistical language. R is of course an increasingly popular open-source program that can handle everything from regression to time series analysis and neural networks. The book is written more as a tutorial than a reference manual, and this makes it surprisingly readable. The book is organized in a very intuitive way, starting with basic functions, then describing the general approach to writing algorithms, and finally going through a series of mathematical functions. It is outstanding for readers who have some familiarity with other statistical programs -- SAS, Matlab, RATS, etc., and who need to familiarize themselves with R code. The treatment of advanced mathematical techniques is rather cursory, so readers who want to use R for more sophisticated types of programming may need to consult other sources. Still, as an introduction, this is very clear and well written.",1
Darth Mallow,1.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),Save Your Money,There is nothing positive I can say about this book. It provides very little extra information on pretty much any subject and is so poorly organized that it's nearly impossible to find what you're looking for.

I ordered this book and found the information to be immensely helpful in improving my overall understanding of the language and for improving my code development. The examples are very clear and I have gone back to this source over and over again when questions come up.

David Mankins,5.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),Worth the price for the tutorial alone,"As other reviewers have noted, the introductory material for R can be somewhat opaque. I've read tutorials and books on R, and still feel as though I don't have much of a grasp on how the language actually works. This book starts with a tutorial that sets out the basics of the language, its data-model, and how that data-model is reflected in syntax in a way that makes the use of R clear, and does so in a way that is far more effective than any other tutorial I've seen. The following chapters on the language itself are written in a way that draws you through them.

Finally, I have a sense of how the language works, and how I can make it work for me.

Beyond that, the book has an extensive description of the language itself, descriptions of the Graph and Lattice Graph models of interaction and presentation, and sections on preparing data, common statistical manipulations, and more.

For me, most Nutshell books sit within reach of my workstation, to be pulled down to read about a particular language feature. This book I find myself browsing and grazing.",3
Greg James (gjames@netguild.com),2.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),"The more I use it, the less I like it.","This book tries to be all things R to all people - and it comes up short.

First, let me just say that I bought 2 copies of this book practically as soon as it was in print based solely on my past experience with O'Reilly books. One for home and one for the office. I was expecting a ""go-to"" book that I could pick up whenever I need a quick, but thorough, reference to some aspect of R programming. I thought that's what the O'Reilly Nutshell series is all about, but I should have waited as this is NOT what I was expecting.

The book covers a lot of ground without much depth. From the Table of Contents it looks like it's all here, but when I actually get into the material I find it lacking. R and all its packages is huge: there has to be less material in a printed reference than what is available online through CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network: cran.r-project.org) or many other sources. But this book reads more like the introductions of major topics rather than a vetted reference. There are just too many important details completely missing. For example, nowhere in the entire book is even a short description of the R workspace or how your project files are organized and stored by the R system.

In my opinion Part IV, ""Statistics with R,"" should have been left out entirely. The space could have been better devoted to the details missing in the first 3 sections covering the language and system pragmatics. Instead, what we have are very basic intro's to common statistics and machine learning models. Maybe a better alternative would have been a single chapter that provides an overview of the myriad packages and algorithms available to the R programmer. Certainly a reference to CRAN's ""Task View"" page would be in order?

As I said, R is huge. A true ""Nutshell"" book would be invaluable to me and I'm sure many other R programmers. That's what O'Reilly books are renowned for. Unfortunately, this is not the one for R. This book provides a good overview of R, but you will probably outgrow it in a couple of months. I truly hope they come out with a 2nd edition that achieves that goal. Until then I continue to search through the R manuals.",14
Benji W,3.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),Kindle Edition Problems,"It's still TBD if this book will teach me what I need to know to be proficient with R. There certainly is a lot of content, but using a reference on a kindle is very difficult, especially when it is impossible to distinguish between periods and commas. Seriously, this is a HUGE issue, as periods and commas are constantly used in the language. I've made many errors working through the examples, all because I couldn't make this crucial distinction.

I paid 25 dollars for this book, so I should hope this issue is addressed down the road so I can get a replacement download.

Edit: Turns out that I was able to distinguish between the period and commas when I wasn't working in direct sunlight. But for the more visually impaired kindle readers, it still may be too difficult to make the distinction, sun or no sun.",7

I've used the "" in a Nutshell"" books before, but this one just does not work for me. I've found a couple university course websites and the books and supplementary web materials by Crawley, Dalgaard, and Bolker to be more useful.

For this review-- my point of view is that of a person who wants to learn R as a programming language-- not someone who wants to just learn how to use R for statistical analysis.

JTR,5.0 out of 5 stars,Working with Odoo,This is an excellent resource for anyone who uses Odoo,"This is an excellent resource for anyone who uses Odoo, but it is especially useful for anyone wanting to customize Odoo for their business. I am particularly impressed with Odoo's new website builder, and with the help of this book, we were able to quickly build an e-commerce website that is fully integrated with other Odoo modules. This is a huge deal. We have needed a new website for quite a while, but companies willing to integrate with our accounting system wanted more than we could reasonably pay. The detailed instructions in this book allowed us to build our website in-house, and it works better than we could have hoped. I haven't yet ventured into creating my own custom modules, but I have been able to do some customization, and it has made life easier for me and my employees. Even something as seemingly simple as creating a custom search and saving it for later has been incredibly helpful. The book itself is well written and organized, and the real-life examples are really nice. I now find myself wanting to customize Odoo to do things I had never even considered.",7
anon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Working with Odoo,This is THE ODOO book you want.,"I loved this book even more than the previous (the pre_ODOO, ERP version).
It is well laid out, written for clear understanding, and easy to follow.
The best part is it can be useful to someone new to the open-source enterprise management system as well as to experienced users since it goes well into customization examples.
It is written by someone with such an in-depth knowledge on the subject, that he shares best practices along the way. Coming from the IT field, I can offer that best practices are a great way to lay down a *sustainable* foundation.

This book can be used as an as needed reference or a learn as you go tool. If you follow the book from the beginning, you will install and implement ODOO using an easy to understand real world example.

The Table of Contents alone is loaded with detail.
Want to understand the ODOO Architecture before you install? There's a section for that and it explains the underlying database and all the platforms it can run on.
Don't know anything about Ubuntu? There's a section for that AND the book gives you the flexibility to install on a Windows platform if Linux is not in your wheel house. Want to really look under the hood? My favorite chapters are 9 and 10. Chapter 9 goes into the principles of Project Management and Chapter 10 discusses customization using Advanced Search Features. These and other sections of the book will help you customize your ODOO installation to meet *your* business needs. It can help you pick and choose the right modules for you, and supplies you with resources for unique situations. It is the most thorough coverage on ODOO you can find.

I'd recommend this book for beginners and experienced users who want to explore the multitude of possibilities with ODOO.",2

John Knepper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics,I loved this book:,"If you haven't programmed in perl before, this book is perfect for learning. It also teaches very low level bioinformatics skills that'd probably help an undergraduate get their next internship. I was clueless to perl, and programming for that matter, when I got this book a long time ago. I painfully flipped each page from front to back, because it 'is' a technical book, and absorbed everything as much as possible. This book set me off in a direction that I never imagined. Although we're on the brink of version six of the language, this book will do you right in any aspect of computer programming. For a 'beginner' looking to get into any language, this book is for you. It's painful, but try and take the time to really learn the information the book presents. It not only teaches you perl, but gives you a peek into the numerous databases and resources that exist as well as a terrific job of teaching you how to use regular expressions.

In the end, you'll have the foundation to become whatever kind of perl programmer you desire. If you're looking into bioinformatics, or a bioinformatician looking to learn, I recommend this book as well as 'Programming Perl', 'Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics', and 'BLAST'. 'BLAST' is fairly easy to breeze through and does a good job of explaining everything you would need to know. 'Mastering Perl...' picks up where this book left off, and 'Programming Perl' is one of the best buys I ever made, in regards to perl. I know these are all O REILLY books, but they're probably the best source for perl books out there. I'm not pitching their books either. Lastly, if you have the time I recommend you crunch on through 'CGI Programming with Perl'. Although the book is a bit out of date, it's definitely another 'piece' of the puzzle for someone to become a LAMP programmer.",1

- explains regexes pretty well to the uninitiated (I do still look up how to do some regex things in it)

At this point I rarely look back at this book even as a reference. It was a stepping stone that I've now left behind.",1
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics,Very timely introduction to PERL,"Finally someone has written a beginning book on PERL for biologists, and has also done an excellent job of doing so. This book assumes no prior programming experience, and therefore suits the biologist who needs to concentrate on using computers to solve biological problems, and not have to become a computer scientist in the process. PERL can be a very cryptic language, but it is also extremely concise, and PERL programmers frequently and rightfully boast about their ""one-liners"" that accomplish complicated tasks with only one line of code.
Since it is addressed to readers with no programming experience, the author introduces some elementary concepts of programming in the first three chapters. These include what text editor to use, how to install PERL, how run PERL programs, and other relevant elementary topics.
The author then gets down to writing a program to store a DNA sequence in chapter 4. Very basic, it merely reads in a string and prints it out, but serves to start readers on their way to developing more useful programs. Later a program for the transcription of DNA to RNA is given, which illustrates nicely the binding, substitution and trace operators. Block diagrams are used here, and throughout the book, to illustrate basic PERL operators. The author shows in detail how to read protein sequence data from a file and how to use it in a PERL program. The reader is also introduced to the most ubiquitous data structure in all of computing: the array. Already the reader gets a taste of the power of PERL to manipulate arrays, using operations such as 'unshift', 'push', 'splice', etc.
The next chapter introduces conditional statements in PERL, as a warm-up for the discussion on finding motifs in sequences. The reader can see why PERL is the language of choice in bioinformatics, with its ability to find substrings or patterns in strings. Things do become more cryptic in the discussion of regular expressions, but the reader can get through it with some effort. Interesting programs are given for determining the frequency of nucleotides.
Since the programs have become more complicated to this point, a discussion of subroutines follows in the next chapter. And, for the same reason, the reader is introduced to debugging in PERL in this chapter also. The greater the complexity of the program, the harder it becomes to avoid making mistakes, and even more difficult to find them. The very important concepts of pass by value versus pass be reference are discussed briefly in this chapter.
Random number generators, so important in any consideration of mutations, are discussed in chapter 7. It is shown, via some straightforward programs, how to select a random location in DNA and mutate it with some other nucleotide. In addition, the author shows how to use random numbers to generate DNA sequences and mutate them in order to study the effect of mutations over time.
The next chapter is the most interesting in the book, for it shows how PERL can be used to simulate how the genetic code directs the translation of DNA into protein, the hash data structure being used extensively for this purpose. The author shows how to read DNA from files in FASTA format, and discusses in detail reading frames. He gives a useful subroutine to translate reading frames.
The author returns to regular expressions in chapter 9, wherein they are used as 'wildcards' to search for a particular string in a collection of strings. In addition, the range operator is used to find restriction sites. Regular expressions are also used in the next chapter to manipulate GenBank 'flat files'. The author does however give URLs for more sophisticated bioinformatics software. This is followed in chapter 11 by a discussion of the use of PERL to work with files in the Protein Data Bank. Recursion, one of the most powerful techniques in programming, is introduced here.
Chapter 12 covers the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), wherein readers get a taste of the field of computational biology. This extremely popular software package is used to find similarity between a given sequence and a library of known sequences. The author does discuss some of the basic rudiments of string matching and homology, and encourages the reader to consult the BLAST documentation for further details. In addition, the author briefly discusses the Bioperl project in this chapter, and shows the reader how to run some elementary computations using it.
This book definitely is a timely one and it will serve the needs of biologists who need to obtain some programming expertise in PERL. There are helpful exercises at the end of each chapter that serve to solidify the understanding of the concepts introduced in the chapter. After a thorough study of it, readers will be well-equipped to use PERL in bioinformatics. With more mathematical background, readers after finishing it will be able to enter the exciting field of computational biology, a field that is exploding, and one in which will require imaginative programming skill in the future.",48

My point is, e.g., a chapter or section starts and the introduction provided to this topic under consideration is almost completely missing. Moreover, the explanations given in the main text are just not good.

1. This book assumes that you already have some background and quite a bit of familiarity with the subject

2. While it contains many topics, most materials are only ""presented"" rather than ""clearly explained"". And so, while it may be good as a reference book, at least for me, this definitely shouldn't be your main resource when first studying the subject.

Randolph Eck,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Deeper Genome: Why there is more to the human genome than meets the eye,Our Complex Genome,"According to John Parrington, his interest in writing this book developed from a concern about how our genomes make us human. What the author purports to do is find a middle ground between two views: one that states that the complexities of the human condition can be reduced to hypothetical ""genes,"" and the other that views things as more complex, yet rejects the idea that we have learned any useful information from the genome project. He brings to the table many years experience studying genes and their function. In the process, he challenges some long held beliefs in biology, such as the treatment of genes in isolation and the very definition of a gene. What's interesting, and what got my attention in this book, is how newly recognized features of the genome have played a fundamental role in the emergence of Homo sapiens as a unique species.

He begins by discussing the work of Darwin, Wallace, Mendel, Flemming, Mayr, Crick, Watson, and many others too numerous to mention here. These people laid the foundations for our knowledge base on genetics that we have today. It would be helpful if the reader had at least a rudimentary knowledge of genetics for a better grasp of the material present here, I feel.

Beginning with chapter three, we delve into what I find very fascinating. I have always thought that the concept of natural selection and mutations was too simple. I felt evolution needed a more pliable, more complex genome machinery than we have assumed. Parrington shows us just how complex this genome really is according to recent studies. He discusses switches, importance of histones, enhancers, introns, and the fact that the ""junk"" designation for most of the genome may be, in fact, misleading.

RNA seems to play a bigger role that we thought. We learn of RNA as a catalyst, as self-replicating, the RNA-induced silencing complex, RNA interference, non-coding RNAs, siRNA, miRNA, piRNA, and lcRNA. Other tantalizing findings of the genome are ""its 3D character, the mobility of genetic elements, and links between genes and the environment mediated by epigenetic mechanisms."" There are topologically associating domains and even `transcription factories."" There is even some evidence now that Lamarck may not have been entirely off base in his belief that the environment can shape the genome, and that these changes can be passed down - think epigenetics. This all makes sense. Life is complicated, and it would need to be accompanied by a sophisticated, complex genome machine so life can evolve.

Parrington devotes some space to discussing genes and disease, where we find out that ""the genetic basis of human disease is itself turning out to be far more complicated than many people had predicted."" In the final chapters, the author discusses what it is that makes us human and there is also a section on the genome and the brain. Throughout the book, he related how the ENCODE (ENCylopedia of DNA Elements) project mapped out diverse biochemical activities across the entire genome. He concludes that ""the findings of such analyses are revealing an undreamt of complexity in the genome."" His hope is that this book will stimulate a desire to learn more about the workings of the genome and how we are affected. But he also hopes ""that it has reaffirmed the importance of what truly distinguishes our species.""",24

I study sociobiology in general, and the sociobiology of Homo sapiens in particular. The population genetics of the New Synthesis is now verging on a century old, and it is firmly grounded in a conception of genetic information transmission that is clearly out of date. I have been studying epigenetics and epistasis to understand the complex nature of multicellular organisms and social species. The most important thing I have learned so far is that the traditional idea of how information is passed from a biological entity to its daughter copies goes far beyond Mendelian segregation.

This book describes contemporary genetic research in to complex information transfer mechanisms in the genome. It requires that the reader know something about molecular biology, but not that much. The description is very well done, and the bibliography is extensive and well directed.

technophobic,5.0 out of 5 stars,What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery,"Do yourself a favor, pick up What Mad Pursuit","In choosing popular science books, I use a couple of ground rules;

- First Rule: Never pick books written by journalists or other professional writers without scientific training and practical experience. At best, their work is ""on the job training."" You are always left wondering whether their assertions are maybe off-the-wall. Their understanding of the subject matter is not deep enough to see the counterpoints.

- Second Rule: For professional writers WITH scientific training & experience but without being in the class of Einstein or Feynman (limiting myself to 20th century examples), pick their first book, probably the one that made them famous and opened the gates to more writing. A good example here is Douglas Hofstadter, whose Gödel, Escher, Bach was terrific. The trouble with the professional writers cum solid scientists is that their later works tend to become repetitive or steer us in directions where their qualifications are lacking.

- Third Rule: For scientists of the top shelf, pick any of their popular writings, although you may want to start with their most personal book.

The above is a long way to explain how I got to What Mad Pursuit, by Francis Crick. Crick was of the Einstein/Feynman class. What Mad Pursuit is a slender, popular volume, putatively about Crick's pursuits in molecular biology and the discoveries (with James Watson) of the DNA structure & the genetic code, but actually about Crick's personal experiences with scientific discoveries. Descriptions of the work on the DNA structure and the genetic code illustrate the way discoveries come about. Factors such as partnership (Watson), collaboration, competition, priority and recognition are all covered - and without a single trace of self-absorption, an Englishman the way you like to think about them.

A touching part of the book is the Epilogue - here you are, one of a handful of the greatest scientists of the 20th century, but what do you do with the rest of your life (in Crick's case 40 years) after the discoveries that brought you fame? What do you do for a second act? Without saying so directly, Crick appeared to have understood that second acts (a la Einstein or Bardeen) are near impossible. Reading the Epilogue, he appeared to be at peace with it.

Do yourself a favor and pick up What Mad Pursuit.",8
P. B. Sharp,5.0 out of 5 stars,What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery,Interesting and provocative,"I have been intrigued with Francis Crick after reading James Watson's ""The Double Helix."" Crick, with his non-stop talk and his booming laugh stepped out of those pages as a very unique personality as well as a unique scientist. Crick almost seems to have emerged a full-blown scientist like Athena from the head of Zeus. He was incredibly knowledgeable even as a somewhat elderly (over thirty) graduate student. In ""Mad Pursuit"" Dr. Crick takes your thumb and firmly imbeds it into the scientific pie In order to understand the background necessary to fathom the depths of the physical and three dimensional aspect of DNA, an understanding of crystal diffraction is necessary. Crick makes sure you're with him as he explains.

The atoms of a crystal cause an X ray beam to diffract into many specific directions, creating ""spots."" The resulting pattern can tell the expert the atoms present in that particular molecule and how they are arranged. DNA is relatively simple with the four bases, adenine paired with thymine, cytosine with guanine. Whatever the sequence on one helix strand, the other has to have the complementary sequence: always C with G and A with T. Crick says the relatively simple arrangement of only four bases was necessary for life to get established in the new universe, the simpler the better for achieving success.

The chapter called ""How to live with a Golden Helix"" is my favorite as Crick puts his spin on the famous events surrounding the phenomenal break through. He says that it it is DNA itself, not the scientists who are glamorous, although one could argue this point. Perhaps the crux of the discussion is Crick's take on Rosalind Franklin and the feud between her and Maurice Wilkins at King's College, London. Crick's ""What mad Pursuit"" was published in 1988 and in the years since, Franklin, even though deceased, has become famous in her own right. Crick remarks that Rosalind did not have the panache of Linus Pauling, which is certainly true. Very few scientists have Pauling's showmanship. But Crick remarks that he and Watson at Cambridge worked harmoniously together, while workers at King's did not. Franklin apparently thought Wilson considered her his assistant and rebelled. Crick, however, does not make the salient point that Wilkins showed Watson one of Franklin's Xray diffraction pictures-the now famous #51- which he borrowed without Franklin's knowledge or permission. The wily Watson took one look at the diffraction pattern and knew at once that the B form of DNA was a double helix. Crick says that Franklin was very, very close to solving the mystery herself, only two steps away.

""What mad pursuit"" is a quotation from Keats' ""Ode on a Grecian Urn.""Crick describes the red herrings, sloppy science, unsound, unproven ideas and fiascoes that confront the research scientist. He also describes the flights of sheer brilliance and courage that accompany any scientific discovery. His book is part memoir part genetics 101 as he takes you on his journeys into the depths pure science. He talks about natural selection, and the genetic code and as a Professor at the Salk Institute his then current studies of neuroanatomy, brain science.

The text is accompanied by really wonderful photographs of many of the major players on his stage. You'll see Linus Pauling with his molecule models, looking like the conjuror he was, Wilkins, Watson and other famous investigators, his wife Odile and his mother for whom Crick is a dead ringer. One wishes the modest Crick had talked more about his personal life, but the impression he gives is that of a charming extrovert who just happened to be a great scientist.",6

Arun Goud,4.0 out of 5 stars,Double Helix (Scribner Classics),"A cheeky, thrilling memoir of the discovery of DNA's structure","I decided to give this book a try after watching the short, well-acted BBC Horizon documentary ""Life Story"" which is based on this book with Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm of Jurassic Park) playing the role of James D. Watson. The names of James Watson and Francis Crick have been forever immortalized in high school biology textbooks for their principal role in the 1953 discovery of the molecular structure of the DNA with the names of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin being only mentioned in passing. They make it seem as if everything was smooth sailing during this discovery. ""Honest Jim"" puts any such misgivings on the part of the reader to complete rest by giving a brutally candid and perhaps even one-sided recounting of the events that led to the fateful 1953 discovery.

This 226 page book, first published in 1968, has gained much notoriety and rightly so for some of the statements made by the author would seem bold, innopportune and outright outrageous.

There are a lot of personalities involved and like another reviewer I'll list the most important ones and their situation in 1951

1. James Watson - A 23 year old recently-graduated molecular biologist and geneticist from Indiana University who goes to Copenhagen University as a postdoctoral fellow in 1950 at the behest of his supervisor Salvador Luria and collaborator Max Delbruck in order to learn nucleic-acid chemistry necessary for tackling DNA's structure. A year later, after hearing about X ray crystallography (XRC) from Maurice Wilkins of King's College, London, he switches to Cavendish Lab at Cambridge University to work in Max Perutz's lab with the hope of getting to learn XRC.

2. Maurice Wilkins - Of King's College, London. A Physicist turned Biologist who uses XRC to generate photographs of DNA.

3. Francis Crick - A 35 year old, loud mouthed PhD student of Max Perutz at Cavendish lab who becomes Watson's close colleague and collaborator. He makes his ambitious wish clearly known to all - to discover DNA's structure and beat the American chemist Linus Pauling at his own game. The only problem preventing him from pursuing this along with his dissertation work is that it's unethical to hijack someone else's project within England - in this case, Maurice Wilkins's in nearby King's College. Once he teams up with J.D. Watson, all concerns for ethics go down the drain.

4. Linus Pauling - The famous Caltech, Pasadena based Chemist who is fresh out of his triumph of deciphering correctly the alpha-helix structure of proteins and is on an all out mission to decode the structure of the DNA. He is more hands-on and prefers to deduce molecular structure by building trial-and-error toy models of biomolecules that satisfy experimentally measured data instead of resorting to purely XRC based approach.

5. William Lawrence Bragg - The son in the father-son duo of W.H.Bragg-W.L.Bragg who developed the technique of X-ray crystallography for probing crystal structures and after whom the Bragg's law is named. He is the director of Cavendish lab and is particularly interested in having the DNA structure figured out at Cambridge before any outsider beats them to it.

6. Rosalind Franklin - The most tragic character in this tale of intrigue. She's been hired to assist Maurice Wilkins on the DNA project and XRC is her specialization. Believes in systematically deducing DNA's structure purely from XRC instead of playing with toy models. Has a sour working relationship with Maurice Wilkins and prefers to carry out her task independently. Maurice frequently complains about her to Watson and Crick who on their part try to pump him for XRC photographs generated by Rosalind.

The whole book is a very quick read with some pages containing photographs of the people mentioned and some of the handwritten technical letters that JDW wrote back to Max Delbruck. The 2012 special annotated edition of this book has a lot more illustrations. Even though this book is aimed at a general audience there are a lot of terminologies (such as sugar-phosphate backbone, nucleotides, tautomers, etc) which are not clearly explained and may require the reader to frequently look up Wikipedia.

As for my views on how the events unfolded, I consider it a tragic irony that the structure of the DNA was ultimately decoded not by the experienced and righteous Linus Pauling but instead by two youthful, relatively unknown braggarts at Cavendish Lab that were trying to imitate Pauling's model-building tactics. Also JDW's occasional gibes at Rosalind Franklin (or ""Rosy"" as he called her mockingly) seem annoying and though he does try to patch up his professional relationship with her by giving her full credit for generating the excellent XRC photographs, it feels half-hearted and too late. The what-if question remains that she might have perhaps beaten them all to the solution only if she and Maurice had been aware that JDW and FC were closing in on the answer. But then again she might have also suffered the same fate as Lise Meitner and Jocelyn Bell did. Perhaps her own memoir on the events that transpired might have thrown light on what was happening at that time. All this is left for the reader to speculate upon.

My only complaint about this book is that it ends in a very anti-climactic fashion. After leading the reader through the neck and neck race that went on, JDW finishes the memoir in a mundane fashion. All along he makes it very clear that glory is all he cares about. To each his/her own, I suppose. After all not everyone can be like Grigori Perelman. What JDW manages to successfully capture in this book and convey to the readers are - the sense of urgency that prevailed at that time among DNA researchers, the styles and techniques adopted to infer molecular structure and the ultimate thrill of discovery. For this sake alone, this book deserves to be read. (And also because it features on Library of Congress' ""Books that Shaped America"" list)

Lastly, here are some excerpts that will demonstrate why this book is considered scandalous
1. The opening line of Chapter 1 begins memorably as such - ""I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood."" One can only imagine what FC's first reaction could have been when he read that line.

2. On the sticky ""Why-only-me?"" situation that Maurice Wilkins found himself in - ""All this was most unsettling to Maurice. He had not escaped into biology only to find it personally as objectionable as physics, with its atomic consequences. The combination of both Linus and Francis breathing down his neck often made it very difficult to sleep. But at least Pauling was 6000 miles away and even Francis was separated by a 2 hour rail journey. The real problem, then, was Rosy. The thought could not be avoided that the best home for a feminist was in another person's lab.""

3. On W.L.Bragg - ""For too long he had lived under the shadow of his famous father, with most people falsely thinking that his father, not he, was responsible for the sharp insight behind Bragg's law."" This is awkward considering that the foreword to this book was written by W.L.Bragg and on his part W.L.Bragg states gracefully ""Those who figure in this book must read it in a very forgiving spirit.""",5

This was such an amazing discovery, which makes the book that much better to read. Watson is great at thoroughly explaining the challenges they went through. They fail many times, like all scientists sometimes do, but it all paid off in the end. He tells the story very well, and explains the different encounters he had with many different scientists. He talks about his times working with Crick in the Cavendish laboratory, and what they went through to finally discover DNA. Watson writes a lot about the scientific part of his discovery, but also writes about the adventures and vacations he went on, which make the story that much more interesting. The novel also has pictures in it, which I love. They help me follow the plot of the story, and help me form an image in my head of what he is talking about. Some of the images are also diagrams that are labeled to help you understand the scientific part of the book.

Written by Dr. James D. Watson in 1968, reprinted several times, this is one of the most intriguing, personal stories of scientific endeavors written to unravel the molecular basis of heredity and the genetic code of life itself, the DNA molecule - deservingly referenced as the Holy Grail of scientific inqiry. With an explanatory apology, Watson describes his maturation from an initial lazy undergraduate at Univ. of Chicago having primary interest in ornithology and avoiding chemistry and physics courses,to doing post-doctoral research abroad, first in Copenhagen and subsequently in Cambridge where he began serious research with Francis Crick that culminated in elucidating the molecular structure of the double helix DNA molecule with base-pairing of A-T and G-C, allowing a model construct possessing correspondence to its X-ray crystalline lattice structure. Much of the time it appeared to a 'Mission Impossible'. Success came in 1953, Watson was then 25 years old.

The author's prose and pace of relating this story reveals the passion of his quest to establish his mark in science - and he relates intimate anecdotes of his cohorts, teachers and the scientific cult of divisions enjoyed by the scholarly, erudite academicians in England and elsewhere. In the end, he shared along with his associate Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins, the Nobel Prize in 1962. The future of medicine was forever changed.

These adjectives would be the best way of describing not only the tone of this memoir, but also the personality of its author, the famed James D. Watson who, with the help of others, discovered the structure of DNA. The slight tome gives a unique, inside-look at the inner workings and egos of the scientific community, especially in regards to winning fame and renown. In fact, that seems to be the only goal - there isn't much regard to the fact that their biological work with DNA and helices could actually benefit society. The quest for the Nobel Prize is the dominant theme of the book, and the author is very alienating in this regard. The ending is abrupt and frankly anticlimactic, although, as previously stated, the honesty was rather refreshing. However, the memoir was filled with suspense and intriguing in its descriptions of bickering and competition between scientists.

I marginally enjoyed reading The Double Helix simply because I never would have read it had it not been a selection by my book club. I enjoyed the perspective, and did find the final chapters engaging as the final pieces of the DNA puzzle were discovered. The book as a whole, however, was quite difficult to get through with feigned interest. Watson recounts the experience by pulling from personal letters and his journal, and it is quite obvious to the reader throughout. The writing style and quality is subpar, and he certainly focuses on aspects of the experience that I doubt many readers care about.

The book itself is not horrible, and this first hand account certainly carries value, but it isn't something I would recommend to anyone other than those with a very keen desire to understand the discovery of the structure of DNA.",1

Now I'll have to assemble a character sheet because this otherwise brilliant man completely missed that we as the reader are not going to have an easy time remembering the names of EVERYONE he mentions, let alone properly pairing their first & last correctly.

That is a guideline for implementing a software system and nothing else. One chapter includes a series of ""fork bombs"", little Perl scripts intended to crash a computer if they're run. They inserted in the text without comment, as a way to make the authors look smart, but any script kiddie could have looked up these little programs on the Internet. Why present them here?

Matthew S. Lalonde,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bioinformatics Programming Using Python: Practical Programming for Biological Data,"Broken Code, Frustrating","I strongly recommend against buying this book, since so much code doesn't work. You will waste your time endlessly debugging the example code. I can't imagine any of the code in this book has been tested, since so few examples actually work as-written. In fact, I am very confused by the positive comments here - did any of you type up the examples and try them?

Case 1 in point: example 4-15, line 2 of definition is incorrect and must be modified by decreasing indentation one level and changing 'line' to 'description'.

Case 2 in point: The code in example 4-31 will not work on it's own, and requires the ""get_items"" definition given in example 4-30. Took me 30 minutes to figure that one out, in which time I learned no bioinformatics or Python.

Case 3 in point: Code in example 5-2 is quite flawed. Definition 'get_type' returns 'type' (Python built-in function with no argument). The function does nothing useful as-written. The next function in the same example returns 'locus', a variable that has not been defined (although 'self.locus' has). Super frustrating.

So many other examples of broken code. I strongly recommend NOT buying this book. It's unfortunate since it could be a good resource (albeit with a lot of testing and proofing). I sincerely hope O'Reilly and Mitchell Model improve and re-release this text, but it's completely useless as-is.",4

The poor layout of the book even makes it difficult to read. The main text of the book is interspersed with examples, ""Math Minutes"" and other text which are not properly set off from the main text.

The web links associated with the book are outdated and do not appear to be updated by the publisher to keep up with changes. If a web site is associated with a book, it should at the very least keep up with changes. In a quickly changing field such as bioinformatics these updates are absolutely critical.

The book is also overpriced given the low quality content and paperback binding. The figures are subpar with only purple and gray coloring. I would expect at least a few full color figures for a book at this price point.

However, if you are willing to put in the effort and educate yourself on the way whenever necessary, you get a fabulous and intriguing state of art overview of the greatest milestone in biology, or perhaps in all science. Dr. Kunin is basing his review mainly on the recent achievements in the genetics of microorganisms, particularly primitive bacteria and viruses. Highlights:
1. No more infinitely small one base mutations to eventually achieve a new improved protein with the same, or even different function. Instead horizontal gene transfer for the lowly microorganisms, or gene duplication for the lofty eukaryotes. In both case, the organism purchases an entire protein or even a whole set of genes to play with.
2. The shift from the ancient RNA world to the ""modern"" protein world requires ribosomes, minute sub-cellular machines that synthesize proteins. However, there is no model that may explain a gradual emergence of the ribosome. What then? God? ETs? Creationists might have some fun with this problem.
3. Certain aspects of evolution appear to be DIRECTED (!!!) rather than random. This is a real whopper, even more than the unexplained/unexplainable appearance of the ribosome.

Christopher K. Koenigsberg,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution (paperback),"great book, BUT could be misunderstood by creationist nuts","Disclaimer: I am reviewing an advance unproofread copy that I received for free through the Vine program. I'm also reviewing the Kindle edition, which I also got for free.

I was a little concerned from reading the ""blurbs"" about this book, that it might be misconstrued as some kind of support for creationist attacks on evolution (you can even see this from some other reviews). Indeed some bits in the introductory parts of the book are a bit alarming in this respect, unnecessarily appearing to attack Charles Darwin, or the neo-Darwinist strict adaptationalist modern paradigm. I think the author and/or publishers tried to gin up some non-existent controversy through some exaggerated remarks, to try and generate some sexy press, in this regard.

The exaggerated remarks pointing out that the neo-Darwinist adaptationist paradigm is incomplete are hardly indictments of the ""theory of evolution"" in general -- indeed, it reminds me more of how Einstein generalized Newton's laws, by filling in details in places, special cases of the very large, very small, or very fast, where Newton's laws break down.

In the case of this book, these special cases are the world of prokaryotes, basically, where things do apparently work a bit differently overall than they do in the world of eukaryotes. In fact later in the book, the author gives us a detailed picture of one important distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, leading to this difference -- HGT (Horizontal Gene Transfer) is a very common and important occurrence, ""driving"" evolution among prokaryotes where the DNA is not isolated. BUT in eukaryotes, the wall of the nucleus is a barrier that mostly stops HGT. So among prokaryotes with nuclei, the usual adaptationalist paradigm holds, where natural selection is the dominant occurrence and force ""driving"" evolution.

In the substance of the book it is obviously just a very detailed, up to date, thorough, and wonderful investigation through many aspects of molecular genomics. Also the title of the book is well chosen, because it seems that now we do have more and more real data from the molecular level, the grand story of evolution is a kind of story of molecular chance being modulated by various larger forces, leading to some kind of emergent ""logic of chance""....

The early chapters of the book do present a lot of very detailed, very well documented/footnoted material, on how evolution among prokaryotes does have a strong ""web"" like structure rather than a strict ""tree"" structure, because HGT (Horizontal Gene Transfer) is turning out to be an even more fundamental force driving evolution, among prokaryotes, than strict adaptation is. But that's hardly an indictment of Darwin, or of adaptation as the most successful paradigm ever theorized, for evolution at the level of multi-cellular organisms, or even single-celled eukaryotes!

This is fascinating new stuff, for me at least. And it is pretty technical, so it is hard to follow sometimes. But I still am fascinated by it and I am able to understand enough to (I think) get the main points.

Since this is not a work of fiction, it's probably OK to leak some spoilers? (and other reviews have already done so) -- for instance, (apologies for my mis-translating into crude layman terminology here) it seems that the molecular genomic evidence strongly suggests that eukaryotes (including us humans) may have their origins in some kind of complex ancestor of some Archaea type prokaryotes (with a large genome, subsequently lost in its more modern Archaea prokaryote descendants, yet still lacking a nucleus or mitochondria etc.), which may have captured some kind of Bacterial type prokaryote (the genomic evidence is apparently fairly conclusive as to the family of bacteria that was the predecessor of mitochondria-type organelles inside eukaryotes), tried to eat it I guess :-) but resulted in endosymbiosis, where the resultant creature (and this may even have only happened once, as the rarest of rare events) was a chimera with things on the inside and things on the outside, which eventually had descendants that led to the Least Eukaryotic Common Ancestor ....

The only observation I can make about the Kindle edition is that for the most part it is well-formatted and easy to read, except for the images and diagrams. For them, I turn to the printed edition. But I do have the original Kindle 1, which is less capable at rendering images & stuff like that, so if you have a newer Kindle, they may look better on yours?

But overall I definitely recommend this book for anyone who has enough of a general science background to be able to read this level of technical stuff, and who is interested in evolution and genetics and wants to learn about the current situation (2011), of theories built from data obtained through molecular genomics, large-scale cross-species analyses and comparisons of genomes, etc. across archaea, bacteria, and all manner of eukaryotes.",1
Alex Samaras,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution (paperback),Heavy but very thought provoking read,"This book is targeted at the experts but can be understood well enough by knowledgeable amateurs with some background in genomics (even unofficial; mine comes from my hobby of reading research papers because I am fascinated with biology). Having already read a good number of Dr. Koonin's papers as well as several others referenced in the book helped.

Anyway, this was a fascinating, thought-provoking read, though it was also rather difficult. Koonin's writing style, which serves him quite well in academic papers, doesn't translate extremely well to a full length book. For the sake of comparison, because both books seem to be targeted at a similar level crowd, it is not as readable as ""The Extended Phenotype"" by Richard Dawkins.

However, the ideas are fascinating, and this book seems to be an excellent overview of modern genomics research and what it tells us about what we understand and misunderstand about evolution. I certainly learned a lot about these topics as well as directions that future research will be taking. While I was less than impressed with some of the conclusions near the end (for example, the appeal to MWO and weak Anthropic Principal seemed to me to be a cop-out and at best should be a hypothesis of last resort).

However, I am not an expert, just an interested knowledgeable amateur, so I am not in the best position to judge Dr. Koonin's interpretations of the various data and research. But, whether his interpretations are spot on or not, they are certainly quite thought provoking, and will certainly serve science by creating discussion and lying groundwork for real testable hypotheses of all of the topics of genomics and evolution he discussed.

Mike Blyth,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution (paperback),Challenging and fascinating,"In the preface to this book, the author writes that he set out with the desire to write a popular book along the lines of A Brief History of Time but on the subject of evolution. He soon recognized that the book ""refused to be written that way"" and became much more scientific and specialized. This is quite true. I am not a biologist but a physician, so I have had a fair number of biology courses, but much of this book was at about the limit of my ability to absorb, or even beyond. You probably won't get very far without a basic understanding of molecular biology: chromosomes, genes, DNA, tRNA, mRNA, transcription, translation, replication, ribosomes, operons, introns, splicing, and so on. On the other hand, if you have that background and some basic understanding with the concepts of biological evolution, you'll probably do fine with the book; little else is required--no math or biochemistry, for example. So be sure to take advantage of the ""Look Inside"" feature before you buy.

It's important to note the subtitle, ""The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution."" This is not a chronicle of evolution, but a rather detailed (for a layperson) look at mechanisms of evolution, mostly at the genetic level, along with some reasoning and speculation about how the whole ball of wax got started.

You should also be aware that the ""highest"" organisms considered in any detail are the earliest, single-cell eukaryotes. Animals are, after all, only ""a single, relatively small, tight group of eukaryotes"" while bacteria and viruses are the most numerous and successful organisms on earth. Virtually the entire book is based on the evolution of bacteria, archaea, and viruses, though occasionally animals and plants are mentioned in passing. This is fine, since the purpose of the book is to explore evolution beyond the classical understanding of natural-selection-based, adaptive evolution, and also to probe the earliest origins of life.

I'm not sure what previous reviewer Jim means by ""But it will be a classic because it deals handily with nearly every contested area of evolution, neatly demolishing every criticism leveled by creationists. It does this by making positive statements about what is known rather than by arguing against creationism."" The book certainly deals with some contested areas, but the contests are among evolutionary biologists and not between creationists and biologists. This book and creationists are not in the same universe of discourse.

A few of the book's interesting points include:

* At least at the ""interesting"" scale of evolution (up to the origin of eukaryotes), adaptation or positive natural selection is not the major factor in genetic change: ""the overall quantifiable characteristics of genome architecture, functioning and evolution are primarily determined by non-adaptive, stochastic processes. Adaptations only modulate these processes.""

* Increasing complexity over time is not a measure of some kind of ""progress"" of evolution, but is due largely to two factors: (1) a random-walk phenomenon in which more complex structures will occur by chance given longer periods of time (2) the natural result when the effective population size is not great enough for purifying selection to eliminate slightly deleterious mutations. ""Junk"" DNA can accumulate as a result, both requiring and providing the substrate for complexity. Complexity as a ""syndrome"" of less-numerically-successful lineages coping with junk.

* Viruses as a separate ""empire"" of life not as a derivative of cellular life. The important role of viruses (and other conceptually-related entities) in evolution especially through horizontal gene transfer.

* The importance of the ""Red Queen"" arms-race between hosts and parasites (including especially viruses and other selfish elements) in driving genetic change.

* The logical necessity of an ""RNA world"" as precursor of cellular life. At the same time, the extreme improbability of the whole replication system arising in this universe: a ""back of envelope"" estimate of the probability of life evolving somewhere in the observable universe in 10 billion years is something like one in 10 to the power 1000. The author resorts to the ""many worlds in one"" hypothesis in which there are an infinity of infinite universes, so every possible event happens in not only one but an infinite number of them. We're here to observe one of these extremely improbable universes only because, of all these universes, living observers can only exist in the ones where life did arise (""weak anthropic principle"").",14
Sendthelight,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution (paperback),"""A Creationist nut"" admires Koonin","Koonin acknowledges that evolutionary biology goes beyond science.
Koonin downplays natural selection as the predominant mechanism of evolution, poking into the core of Darwinism.
He denies progression from simple to complex as the trend in evolution, turning Darwin's ""tree of life"" into a network of comparably complex organisms over the history of life.
Koonin points to the failure of the current models to explain the ultimate origin of life.
Using undisputably generous assumptions and simple mathematics, Koonin demonstrates the virtual impossibility for spontaneous origin of fundamental subcellular molecular machines in a finite universe. The only ""reason"" that life actually originated is the fact that we are here as observers. His invocation of the anthropic principle and the Many Worlds Interpretation, which may make some physicists and cosmologists shake their head, is logical, no matter how counterintuitive.
As a biologist (and specializing in virology as he does), I see Koonin as having extraordinary knowledge in biology and physical sciences. Honestly and humbly, he offers illuminating facts for everybody to learn and to assimilate. Whether one agrees with his underlying worldview or not, no one can deny his scientific professionalism.

rita,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution (paperback),Likely to be a Classic,"I'm not qualified to judge whether there are technical errors, so I will assume that a person who has hundreds of peer-reviewed publications will not have made many mistakes.

I can, however, judge the beauty of the writing and compare it to other classics, such as The Selfish Gene and A Brief History of Time. It compares well, even though it contains numerous diagrams and formulas. It's a bit more technical than those works, but only where it needs to be in order to make its points.

But it will be a classic because it deals handily with nearly every contested area of evolution, neatly demolishing every criticism leveled by creationists. It does this by making positive statements about what is known rather than by arguing against creationism. This is a refreshing change from most books written for a wide audience.

Perhaps its boldest claim is that there has been more progress made in the last ten years than in the previous 150 years.

I suspect it will be criticized for concluding that the origin of life might have been a one in a zillion long shot, and invoking multiple universes to beat the odds. This is presented as speculation, not fact, but it will be quote-mined by ID advocates. Correction, it already has been.",31
Elliot Kleiman,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics,Good Companion text,"This first half of the book focuses entirely on Object-Oriented(OO) Perl. The second half follows up with a general survey of various perl implementations of particular programming issues involving databasing, cgi, graphics, modules, etc, and BioPerl.

This book does a good job of applying Perl in OO for Biology in the first half of the book. In the second half he overviews a few broad topics in bioinformatics; he doesn't go super specific, but its a sufficient overview and for me sparked more interest in understanding how I can use perl to handle my informatics issues.

In the first half, the author does an excellent job on detailing the ins and outs of perl references and how to construct complex data structures. Indeed they are a bit strange looking at first, but the author breaks it down really good so pretty much anyone can understand it.

For me the most intriguing part of the book was in the second half, which included relational databases, graphics, and bioperl. In particular, the chapter that covers Perl DBI and DBD::mysql was really cool. That secion was very helpful for me because I am familiar with php/mysql, but have not ever used Perl to interact with Mysql before.

I especially liked the gif draw aka GD chapter. I had no idea how cool GD is. But moreover how it can be integrated with Perl to generate really cool looking plots. Before this book I always used gnuplot. But Tisdall shows you how to get to work with GD pretty good using basic practical examples.

The chapter on BioPerl was especially helpful as well. In particular, he shows you what he did to install the beast. He shows you how to use the CPAN shell and again its really beneficial to read through. It motivated me to pursue other topics in bioperl and how I can use it to query different ncbi databases for example.

Overall, the text provided a good overview on OO Perl and on various other topics involving Perl for Bioinformatics in general. I am glad I bought it. It was really very practical/useful - I refer to it all the time actually!",5
DNA=creation_of_life,4.0 out of 5 stars,"DNA Science: A First Course, Second Edition",Wonderful book but not for beginner.,"This book goes into wonderful details about DNA and coupling to that are experiments to talk about how those discoveries were made. There are a lot of informations to which the reader must memorize to be a dedicated scientist. If the reader does not have a mature and analytical/reasoning skills, then all the informations will be gibberish. The reader also much have a basic understanding of chemistry and biology to understand the informations. If the reader is in high school and is taking Honor/AP biology then the informations will be clear cut. Some abbreviation are used and will not be told to what it stand for. Ex: the book used ""bp"" (it does not mean blood pressure), this refers to as ""Base Pairs"". The book did not provide ""Base Pairs"" so the reader must be able to reason it out base on the context and how bp was used. Over all comment on this book is IT'S AWESOME!!!!",9

Sarah,1.0 out of 5 stars,"DNA Science: A First Course, Second Edition",Not for beginners,"I was hoping to learn from this book, like what a chromosome is and such, but the book did not cover it. (Though I did not read it, I read the first part of it and got bored, it was about the history of DNA, not so much DNA itself, and then just looked through the rest and didn't like it.) To me it was a rambling mess. The ""Small- and large-scale methods for analyzing DNA"" doesn't talk about analyzing DNA at all, its really just talking about the history of people analyzing DNA, not how its done. Very disappointing. This is more of a history book than an actual DNA explained book.",4
John Salerno,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,The extra piece of the evidence for evolution,"I've read three or four other books that explore the evidence for evolution and in all of those books they cover the familiar areas of the fossil record, geographical distribution, etc. and sometimes briefly discuss molecular evidence, but ""The Making of the Fittest"" deals specifically with that area (as you can tell from the subtitle). The book is a fantastic exploration of how DNA (literally the text of the base pairs or the specific amino acids of a protein) provides incontrovertible evidence for evolution. To deny evolution after seeing some of the impressive examples in this book is a clear indication that the denial is based purely on theological grounds and certainly not scientific ones.

The book is divided as such:

Chapter 1: An introduction to what the rest of the book will be discussing. However, I would have preferred that this actually have been an introduction instead of being chapter 1, because it doesn't really get into the topic of the book so much as summarize what each of the following chapters will be about.

Chapter 2: A somewhat difficult chapter that deals with the math of evolution. I love math but I felt at times that Carroll was simply telling us what the results of particular equations mean, as opposed to explaining the math itself. I would like to have learned how to do the calculations myself in the event I need to present this evidence to someone else. At one point he uses a logarithm without even explaining how the equation works, so it raises the question of why he even bothered to show us the math at all if he wasn't going to explain it.

Chapter 3: This is where the book really hits its stride and doesn't slow down for several chapters. This chapter discusses specific genes in our DNA that have remained unchanged for billions of year, evidence that natural selection has worked to keep these genes in place because of their fundamental usefulness to life.

Chapter 4: An utterly fascinating chapter on how new genes have evolved in order to create new features across various species. In particular Carroll discusses color vision and the similarities/differences between species in the genes that affect vision in various animals.

Chapter 5: Yet another completely absorbing chapter on ""fossil genes"" -- genes that have mutated over time and have become inactive, yet still can be used to trace their heritage far back through the past.

Chapter 6: Discusses the phenomenon of evolution repeating itself when given the same set of selection pressures with which to work, and how different species have independently evolved similar (or the same) features as a result.

Chapter 7: Deals specifically with human issues such as the ""arms race"" between increasingly drug-resistant bacteria and human-created methods to deal with such germs.

Chapter 8: A discussion on how complex features (such as the eye) can evolve. Intelligent designers, pay attention!

Chapter 9: Carroll stops with the science at this point and in this chapter deals with the common arguments against evolution and the rational responses to these arguments.

Chapter 10: The final chapter discusses how acceptance of evolution is more than just a philosophical exercise but instead can help us shape the future of not only our species but of many other species on the planet (especially those on the verge of extinction because of human activity). Even though Carroll discusses things such as overfishing, overhunting, pollution, and global warming, I didn't get the impression that he tied all of this up neatly with the actual idea that accepting the truth of evolution can help us with these things.

A few complaints I had were that:

1. At some points the explanations got a little difficult to follow, and not so much because the science (or math) was over my head, but because Carroll didn't seem to fully explain what he was describing. I feel like it was a fault of the writing in certain sections.

2. There are many charts, graphs, and pictures, but they weren't all explained very well. For example, Figure 4.3 (DNA Typing and Hominoid Evolution) shows a comparison of junk DNA called ""SINES"" among various animals (Human, Bonobo, Chimpanzee, Gorilla, etc.), but for the life of me I couldn't figure out what I was looking at or how to read the lines. I got the general idea of what I was seeing, but the caption and even the text itself didn't seem to explain the figure very well.

3. A problem many authors, including Carroll, seem to have is the habit of summing up the topics they are about to discuss. Chapter 1 is mainly a setup for the rest of the book and the final part of it actually sums up what each of the following chapters will discuss. Furthermore, within each chapter Carroll also will sometimes close a section by describing what the next section will be about, or close a chapter by describing what the next chapter will be about. Personally, I find this kind of writing to be somewhat lazy. It contains no real content, no new information, and reads like filler. It's as if the authors are not confident enough to simply end a section or chapter as-is without resorting to some type of segue into the next part.

However, overall the book is a fantastic exploration of how DNA reveals the evidence for evolution across just about every species. If you've read other books about the evidence for evolution, chances are they dealt with a little of this material, but not as in-depth as Carroll's book does. I definitely recommend this book to complement those other books, because it deals thoroughly with the DNA record. You will be amazed to see how similar DNA is across various species, and equally amazed to see that it differs in exactly the ways we would expect it to differ if evolution is true.",5
Book Shark,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,Fantastic!,"The Making of the Fittest by Sean B. Carroll

Fantastic! An accessible book on genetics that hits all the right notes. Music to my ears. Beyond any reasonable doubt this is one of the best books to get on evolution. DNA contains the information that decisively confirms evolution. This book contains the information that makes it clear that it is so.

Positives:

1. Evolution explained for the general masses with focus on genetics.
2. Dr. Carroll uses a great approach to explain the complexities of genetics. Each of the 10 chapters begins with stating clearly what we are expected to learn from that chapter.
3. Some great examples and wonderful illustrations.
4. Great examples of evolution.
5. Some fascinating and memorable information.
6. Introduces new terms you have probably never heard, but will understand as a result of the author's innate ability to present in a clear manner.
7. Great civility used in debunking creationists misinformation on evolution.
8. Powerful and memorable arguments. Well reasoned and well thought out.
9. Covers many topics about evolution not just genetics.
10. There are many great books on evolution: ""Why Evolution is True"" by Jerry Coyne, ""The Greatest Show On Earth"" by Richard Dawkins, ""Your Inner Fish"" by Neil B. Shubin, ""What Evolution Is"" by Ernst Mayr and now ""The Making of the Fittest"" by Sean B. Carroll is also worthy of being on that top mantle of books about evolution.

Negatives:

1. It's not intended for those in the field due to its basic and general approach.
2. I wanted more...more examples.

In summary, a fabulous book on evolution that focuses on genetics. I can't recommend this book enough. Highly recommended to all those who want to learn about evolution but are too fearful that the topic may be way over their heads...no need to fear Dr. Carroll is here.",2
Wayne Robinson,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,Hasn't lost anything in the years since first release.,"I read ""The Making of the Fittest"" years ago, when it first came out in hardcover, and thought that it was very good.

I decided to reread it when I discovered that it had been released as a Kindle eBook, and to my surprise, my memory has played tricks with me; it isn't very good, it's extremely good. Sean Carroll's arguments for the truth of evolution are just as convincing now as they were then.

One thing that surprised me. In the final chapter, Sean Carroll claims that Michael Behe (whom I've always assumed is one of the more sensible Intelligent Design proponents, although that isn't saying much) stated in ""Darwin's Black Box"" that the Intelligent Designer (whoever that is) preloaded the first cell 3.8 billion years ago with all the genetic information necessary for subsequent lifeforms as they unfolded. The only other time I have seen this claimed is in Appendix A of Stephen Meyer's dreadful book ""Signature in the Cell"" where he lists it as one of the 12 'predictions' of ID (actually not; it's one of the predictions that uses 'if' and 'may', the 'prediction' is verified regardless of what occurs). Has anyone read 'Darwin's Black Box' to confirm that Michael Behe wrote something so silly? I don't want to waste my time and money buying his book.",1
The Spinozanator,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,Fossils in DNA,"An exciting book that documents evolution with fossil evidence - but not the usual kinds of fossils. These left their trail of history in DNA molecules. Unlike archeological fossils, they didn't get eaten, destroyed by the elements, scattered by the winds, or destroyed by bulldozers. Nor do they still remain in sediment, unlikely to ever be found and preserved. They are readily available in the cells of every living thing on earth. The information they carry about how life evolved builds logarithmically every year. Unfortunately, there is a bit of a learning curve to grasp the terminology and concepts. Fortunately, there is Sean Carroll to make it as painless as possible.

These fossils left in DNA don't tell us whether a supernatural power was responsible or whether nobody was responsible. They don't tell us much about the origin of life. What they do tell us is that it was done over billions of years by the method of natural selection. We know this because the genes subjected to N/S - used, refined by mutations, and reused - are preserved and remain intact, varying only slightly amongst different species. The genes left unused, not subjected to N/S, have been crippled by trails of mutations but their records survive in DNA - relics of the past. Completely essential genes, genes rendered impotent by disuse and mutation, and other categories of genetic material are all available for our leisurely perusal.

With examples not yet in textbooks, Sean Carroll carefully documents these DNA trails of evidence. It's tedious and redundant at times, but the message comes through loud and clear. ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"" - Theodosius Dobzhansky.",2
Steven E. Romer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,"A page-turner, you will love it!","I have read a lot of books about evolution, and I also read Dr. Carroll's other excellent book ""Endless Forms Most Beautiful"" as well -- so I had high expectations. I was not disappointed. The book is endlessly fascinating and engaging -- you cannot wait to keep turning pages to read more.

One of the best points about this book are the examples that show ""a whole suite of changes"" (p. 24) tend to occur together and build on each other -- pushing some species far into otherwise unoccupied ecological territory, such as his excellent telling of the story of the unique ""bloodless"" ice-fish of Antarctica. This one extreme example illustrates nicely how the whole of evolution works -- sometimes changing existing genes and other times ""inventing"" whole new ways of doing things based on what all the other genes are doing.

Another great point is how he shows that evolution as a ""theory"" might have been questionable in the past (like heliocentrism before the telescope...) but that now molecular biology and forensic DNA studies show us beyond a shadow of a doubt how evolution made us.

Another of the most interesting points is that increasing complexity does not require proportionately more genes, (p. 76) because tiny changes in genes after basic structures are in place can have vast global effects, etc. by tweaking existing patterns. Tiny changes seem to grow potentially more important as the organism gets more complex... As a behavioral neuroscientist, this relates directly to what we know about the massively complex human brain. See the book: ""The Birth of the Mind: How a Tiny Number of Genes Creates The Complexities of Human Thought"" by Gary Marcus for more on that. I bring it up because no matter what your field, you can gain insight and inspiration from this book.

His examples about the development of color and blue-shifted vision in various organisms are extremely interesting and thourough -- revealing a scholarly breadth of knowledge and the fascinating process of evolution coming up with similar solutions to different physical problems in similar situations.

That leads to probably the best point he makes -- that evolution requires vast amounts of time compared to the human life-span. This is the source of much of the problem in people's understanding because they cannot grasp the timescales involved. He shows that tiny advantages in a given gene or changes in environment leading to a relaxation of selection can have large effects over time. He shows that the mathematical probability of certain mutations compared to the vast timescales of evolution virtually guarantee certain changes in organisms over time given environmental pressures (or lack of them...). That point is very relevant to humankind, since we have relaxed many selection pressures with our modern technological society, and created others.

The human relevance of this book to me is the most fascinating aspect of it. We are unique in the history of evolution in the sheer magnitude of our shaping of our own environment. We need to be aware of what we are doing and what that means for our future. Dr. Carroll does an excellent job of showing examples of how we are shaping the environment and survival of other species as well as our own. Whether we like it or not, it seems to be our destiny as humans to become managers of evolution if we want to survive and also save our environment.

Other amazing things he shows are that religion and evolution are not incompatible-- including quotes to that effect from the Pope and the Archbishop of Canturbury (among others)that seem very pro-evolution. In my own book ""The Textbook of the Universe: the Genetic Ascent to God"" I show that science and religion come from the same truth-seeking core impulses of mankind, but that science is just the updated version. That is apparent in this book as well -- where Dr. Carroll gives us a picture of a more accurate creation story that is much more elegant and powerful. A story translated via science straight from the most holy book in essence written by the creator itself in our DNA.

these are only a few of the best points that are explained clearly and engagingly in this book. Very enjoyable to read. Very enlightening. Highly recommended.",2
Hande Z,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,The Fittest Record,"We do not know how much farther science will take us, but from ""Making of the Fittest"", Prof Carroll in tracing the record of evolution through genetic studies suggests that even though we have come a long way, the distance ahead may appear infinite, but has all the prospects of exhilaring scholarship. The genetic record of evolution is an impressive record that goes back 2 billion years. Carroll explains how the record of evolution (descent with modification and the related ""survival of the fittest"" principle) is embedded in our genes. If the idea of it all is breathtaking and seemingly incredible, it was set out and explained in very clearly and lucidly that non-scientists will have no difficulty understanding the text or its implications. If all living things have common amino acids, and genetic codes, as well as how and why they evolved and differentiated as they did, the idea of a personal god promising heaven and hell seem to belong to the category of fairy tales - naturally. The genetic tale of evolution is told through a series of stories, beginning with how and why the Antarctic ice fish evolved its red blood cells into oblivion save for the tell-tale record of its previous existence. He explains how genetic evolution is part of a constant battle among living things. If sickle cells are weaker and more fallible than normal cells, why did they continue to be manufactured? The link turned out to be that people with sickle cells are more resistant to malaria. The stories include the cloak-and-dagger account of the discovery and explication of the DNA. It wasn't too long ago when people were screaming, ""DNA! DNA! Everyone talks about it but has anyone seen it?"" Carroll not only shows us the DNA but explains to us what it does and how it works.",1
Atheen,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,Reread it and learned even more.,"This is a very direct and straight forward explanation of the progress that has been made in the science of genetics over the last 20 years and of the information that it has supplied regarding the evolution of various species. It is also an excellent critique of evolutionary theory and the scientific method. The illustrations drawn from the actual research gives added impact to the logic of evolution and reveals to the reader just how much this theory has changed our lives in the fields of geology, agriculture, medicine, and ecology. A totally impressive and educational book.

The last few chapters but one deal with the issue of resistance to the scientific method and the theory of evolution and are relevant in that they point out the flawed thinking and the benighted motives of the antagonists. Particularly important is the author's point that while the existence of God may be true, God is not subject to scientific investigation, nor does belief in him or his activities and intentions provide us with any reliable method of promoting knowledge of the mechanics of nature or of technological advances that improve the well being of the world's inhabitants. The scientific method and evolution have. God cannot be checked and rechecked experimentally or his doctrines corrected when evidence suggests the need. Everything is based on ""belief"" and questions are not allowed, especially embarrassing questions.

Probably the most outrageous attacks on both the scientific method and evolution have been those form antagonists attempting to tie them to totalitarian regimes and their crimes against humanity. Their arguments seem so logical, ""if this than this..."" until one looks at the basic premise and realizes that the main tenant is not true and that therefore the logic of the argument isn't. Unfortunately, not many people take the time to think things out, and many are incited to ""defend their beliefs"" despite the fact that these beliefs are not under attack. As long as we succumb to the inflammatory rhetoric of the anti-science, anti-evolution segments of our society, we will remain ignorant, and our country will fall behind the rest of the world in the sciences. The author's example of the Soviet Union's lengthy ""dark ages"" in the biological sciences because of political ideology is a case in point, especially as it was not based on religion but on politics. Closed minds are closed, no matter what the motivation is.

The last chapter is really quite depressing. It's not that I had not known the information the author provided, it was just that I had learned it piecemeal from various sources, and here the entire dismal matter is presented in bulk and with irrefutable logic. There have been many religious extremists and other ideopaths who have expressed the belief that Armageddon is due in 2012. After reading this book I'm inclined to agree. Given the major issues facing much of the natural world and the fact that we are as much a part of the web of life as any other living thing, I fail to see how we will be able to pull out of our nose dive. Certainly our dedication to the policy of economic ""survival of the fittest"" borders the reality survival shows. Vote the least popular off the ""island"" and the last one is the winner. That mind set will get us nowhere.

But I prefer to look on the bright side of Armageddon. After all, there will be a certain uniqueness to being the only species in the entire history of living things on this planet to have died from its own shear stupidity. It's just too bad we'll be taking so much that is beautiful along with us.",2
Louie's Mom,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,The best of the evolution explanation books of the last 20 years,"If you read only one book about evolution, read this one. In this book the author does an incredible job of pulling together all those things we hear about regularly - DNA, genes, amino acids, etc. in an explanation of how they function and the immense increase in knowledge they have brought us as to evolutionary relationships and mechanisms. The text is very accessible for someone like me who never studied any of these things after high school and does not work in a science-related field.

Carroll's examples really make evolution exciting - such as how fish in both the arctic and the antarctic have separately evolved ""antifreeze"" that keeps their blood from freezing. The section explaining the evolution of the eye is particularly fascinating as the author tells us about numerous animals with light sensing cells and how the complex human eye evolved from more rudimentary structures.

Carroll touches briefly on the issue of global climate change and how it will dramatically decrease the diversity of species on the earth as it occurs much faster than plants and animals can possibly evolve.

This would make a great gift for anyone curious about how humans became what they are today.",1

The whole junk DNA discussion was amazing to me. I didn't know more than a little about it, but it's just fascinating. The whole book was logically organized and well-explained, with a great mixture of both explanatory prose and persuasive point making.

Photo/Video Gearhead,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,an excellent discussion of the scientific support for evolution,"Anyone with any interest in the theory of evolution should read this book. Citing evidence from the genetics of the visual systems of fish, birds, mammals and primates, Dr. Carroll presents a clear discussion of how mutations create new functionality and also eliminate unused functionality. In addition, he discusses how the mutations that produce sickle-cell anemia and G6PD deficiency have conferred resistance to malaria and thus have been favored by natural selection in humans in some parts of the world. Moreover, he provides a fascinating account of the rejection of scientific evidence, both by the Russian biology community and by the American chiropractic community. My only criticism of this book is the final chapter that diverges into the imminent depletion of fish populations due to over harvesting. While this chapter is interesting in its own right, it has little to do with the rest of the book.",1
Gio,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,Beyond Even an Unreasonable Doubt!,"As Sean Carroll patiently explains, Charles Darwin did not theorize that evolution takes place; he didn't need to. Anyone who has ever bred puppies or guppies, hybridized orchids or corn, raised prize pigs or figs, has proven beyond argument that evolution happens.If all the evidence of evolution were imprinted on microchips and tossed in a pile, the pile would fill St. Peter's Cathedral to the dome. What Darwin theorized is how (and by implication why) evolution occurs--by random mutation, which he called ""descent with modification"", and natural selection by the criterion of reproductive success.
The Making of the Fittest clearly and coherently presents the evidence of modern genetic science that Darwin was basically correct. It's an easier book to read and comprehend that Carroll's previous masterpiece, Endless Forms Most Beautiful, and should be accessible to anyone with a good high school or middling college education. What a wise choice it would be for mandatory inclusion in all high school curricula, so that no child would really be left behind! In the long run, it's a more meaningful and effective book, and more humane, than Dawkins's God Delusion, since the religious fundamentalists are quite correct that evolution is incompatible with their kind of religion. Verily I say unto them, it's impossible to read this book and understand it, and still deny the role of evolution in the history of life.",12

Hodge,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,thought provoking book,"I had to get this book for a college biology class, so it wasn't just a leisure reading thing for me.

Randolph Eck,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,A Well Written Book on the Genetic Evidence for Evolution,"Before reading this book, I read ""Relics of Eden"" by Daniel Fairbanks, which discussed the evidence of evolution in DNA. This was a book I highly recommended, so it was with eager anticipation that I wanted to read this book by Sean Carroll. This book also shows how human DNA presents an uncanny record of the evolutionary process.

Carroll begins by introducing us to the Antarctic ice fish - one of many examples presented in the book. He shows how mutations over time have left the genes for making the globin part of hemoglobin either nonfunctional or completely unrecognizable today, because the ice fish has developed other adaptations for oxygenation. I found interesting the concept of selection coefficients which shows the incremental difference in relative reproductive success and survival between individuals with a trait and those without it. He discusses the melanic mice of the Pinacate desert of Arizona and how a subset of these mice developed darker fur, since they inhabited areas with darker lava, through genetic mutation that we can clearly see in the genes.

In chapter four we learn about the evolution of trichromatic vision, opsin genes and something called pseudogenes - vestiges of lost characteristics. He clearly demonstrates the evolutionary sequence of events that led to this type of vision in a convincing fashion using various species of animals such as the coelacanth, cetaceans, the owl monkey, prosimians, and the blind mole rat.

Some of the other topics discussed include olfactory genes, the vomeronasal organ, the fossilized MYH16 gene in humans which affects the jaw muscles in primates, the ribonuclease gene and ruminating monkeys, yeast genes and much more. Something else I found interesting was the discussion about a common neurotoxin which is characterized by four completely different sequences of amino acids in four different creatures - the sea anemone, a cnidarian; the scorpion, an arthropod; the cone shell, a mollusk; and the black mamba, a snake vertebrate. Yet, each of these sequences has the same neurotoxic effect developing independently in these four categories of creatures.

Chapter eight delves into how the complexity of the eye may have developed. Carroll develops this theme well. He covers the experiments with fly and mouse PAX6 genes, the ragworm eye, and the various stages of eye evolution in mollusks.

Of course being the author of the book ""Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo,"" Carroll presents us with information on regulatory sequences or switches and tool-kit genes.

Carroll concludes by covering science denial and, in particular, the denial of evolution. In the final chapter, he talks about the human effect on species populations.

I found that Carroll made a strong case, genetically speaking, for an evolutionary process. He shows that the evidence is there in the genes for us to see. I would highly recommend this book.",3
John Duncan,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,"Excellent, with refreshingly different examples","One of the most attractive features of Sean Carroll's book is that although he makes many of the same points as one can find in other popular books on biology and evolution he illustrates them with refreshingly different examples. He begins by describing the icefish of Antarctica, a living contradiction of the standard idea that all vertebrates have red blood cells in their blood for transporting oxygen to their tissues: although these fish are clearly vertebrates, they lack the haemoglobin that would make their blood red. At the very low temperatures at which they live, oxygen is much more soluble in haemoglobin-free water than it is at higher temperatures, and they can manage perfectly well without haemoglobin or, in some species, myoglobin, the haemoglobin-like protein responsible for the red colour of many muscles. Not only do they do not need haemoglobin as much as other fish, they gain a positive advantage from not having it because their blood is far less viscous than it would be if it contained a high concentration of dissolved haemoglobin. On the other hand fish that live in very cold water need to avoid freezing solid, and icefish have solved this problem as well, by evolving anti-freeze proteins that prevent their tissues from freezing. All this sets the scene for Carroll to explain how studying the DNA of icefish allows the biochemist to understand what has happened to the haemoglobin that their warmer-living ancestors had, and where the anti-freeze proteins have come from. The globin genes are still there, and still recognizable, but no longer functional.

Later chapters discuss how mutations in DNA arise, and how these result in modifications to proteins, and from there to changes in function -- loss or modification of existing functions, such as colour vision and sensitivity to different odours, or the appearance of new ones. Humans, apes and most old-world monkeys have three-colour vision, for example, whereas most mammals have, at best, two-colour vision and are accordingly red-green colour-blind. On the other hand many birds and fish have four different colour receptors, and lampreys have five. Colour vision and olfactory sensitivity have tended to evolve in opposite directions: species that are mainly active in the day time tend to be strong in the former, and weak in the latter, and vice versa. Much of this is explained by the principle that functions that are not much used or not very necessary for survival tend to be lost, and one finds this illustrated in very diverse life forms. The bacteria responsible for tuberculosis and leprosy, for example, are closely related, but whereas one has retained nearly all of its ancestral genes in fully functional form, the other has lost a great many: being wholly parasitic, living only within host cells, it relies on its host for many biochemical functions that a free-living organism has to do for itself.

Where do new functions come from, and what happens to genes for functions that are lost? In both cases, as Carroll explains, genes become mutated: for new functions, such as the appearance of a new colour receptor, an existing and functional gene becomes duplicated, and then one of the two undergoes small modifications that allow it to code for a protein for a novel function; for an obsolete function there no natural selection to prevent the accumulation of harmful mutations, and eventually these render the gene incapable of coding for a functional protein. After describing many examples of how genetic information can be added or lost in the course of evolution Carroll devotes a chapter to a discussion of creationism, whose adherents sometimes claim that such transformations are impossible. This chapter is perhaps the best analysis currently available of the arguments used for creationism, both by their overtly religious supporters and also by their supposedly ""scientific"" fellow-travellers who promote the fantasy known as ""intelligent design"".",17
Glen R. Bleak,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,Evolution at the molecular level,"Science has discovered the process of geological change through Plate Tectonics caused by the heat engine of radio-active decay at the Center of Earth. Science has discovered the heat engine of nuclear fusion at the center of Sun to make life giving radiation and heat. Now, science is on it's way of discovering the engine that makes Evolution works. Watching the program ""What Darwin Never Knew"" along with this book gave me the insight of the Evolutionary process at the molecular level which is the primary cause of Evolution.

The mathematics is great and I want you to know that Evolution can beat any and all odds. Why, because Evolution has immense amount of individuals in a population and immense amount of time to beat these odds. If a chance of something occurring 1 in 500,000,000 and with a population that sustain itself around 1,000,000 per year along with a turn-over of offspring and deaths each year, then that chance has good probability of occurring once every 500 years. A merger amount of time in geological or Evolutionary time. It these high odds that make viruses impossible to eliminate keeping medical science constantly working on it. Good old Albert, Compound interest is a powerful force and a natural one. With this a .001 advantage will give you 19,807 generations to get to 100% while 0.1 gives you 198 generations. However, I want to let you know, that good old mutation will not allow anything to get to 100%, because 100% will eventually get you extinction. The Doubling Law is an amazing mathematical reality that plays a major role getting genes into a population.

The amazing section of this book is repeatable mutations. I finally got the picture when I understood that this event does occur. The demonstration of the blind insect, fish and salamanders in caves convinced me that repeatable mutations along with mathematics previously discussed makes it a fore gone conclusion that it will eventually make it way into a population when it becomes a favorable. I call this a ""Mutation looking for a home."" I believe repeating mutations are the key to Evolution change and modification of species.

In the program ""What Darwin Never Knew"" a mutation of the gene for growth that suppress the jaw muscle in humans appear to be the initiation of developing the homo series of species that led to Homo Sapiens as describe in this program. The first 4 million years of the upright walking apes indicates the brain size flat lined at the level of the chimpanzee and then about 2 million years ago, brain size started to increase. Now, I would like give my idea on how a small brain hominid started the Homo series of species. Now this mutation being repeated in the past would be definitely be a disadvantage and would be eliminated by Natural Selection. But, a some small brain hominid species had supplemented meat as part of their diet, the same as the chimpanzee do today. Now, this would give this species the development of chemistry for processing meat. Now here comes that pesky mutation that suppress jaw muscle growth in a particular individual, mostly likely a recessive gene that makes it way through the population by the doubling law through successive generations. All of sudden two parents come together, carriers of this gene and one of the four kids gets both of these genes and his jaw muscle doesn't completely develop like the rest of the other three kids. Now, since this species has tried meat eating and the body chemistry is now compatible for processing meat, this youngster has a source of food for survival. Being able to survive, the gene will be passed on to future generations making individuals meat eaters. Now we have a population of both vegetarians and meat eaters, since their life styles will be different causing an isolation within this population. The meat eaters will separate and go on to eventually to become the Homo series of species taking along with them the smaller jaw muscles, allowing the cranium the room to enlarge. Later mutations will eventually occur making the cranium larger, allowing enough space for the brain to enlarge. This will eventually make one of those Homo species to evolve into Homo Sapien.

Another amazing fact is immortal genes. Natural Selection not only select against as well as select for, it also maintains stability. Immortal genes have the same probability of being exposed to mutations as any other genes, but the force of Natural Selection will preserve as will as constructs or destroys.

The remaining issues in this book of Fossil genes, Homologous genes, Vision genes, the Arms Race, along with other materials in this book are absolute fascinating to read. I would recommended it to anybody and even to anti-evolutionists, to let them know, what they are up against.

The only problem that I have with this book, is that it doesn't get into protein synthesis too much. In order to understand Evolution, Mutation, and Natural Selection, the layman like myself need know how proteins are made and what they do. ""What Darwin Never Knew"" gives a good idea what proteins basically do which is to make body parts, boss other genes around and switches, but again, no explanation on protein synthesis process. I know it is a lengthy explanation, but a short version could be devised to give your readers a rudimentary explanation of this process.

To end this review, I have seen the developing of the science of Plate Tectonics along with the discovery of the DNA molecule and it's effects on genetic science now I'm seening the development of Evolution at the molecular level process that Charles Darwin Never Knew. Thanks",1
Steven W,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,Kindle Edition,"I enjoyed this book, as I do with Carroll's other work. It was not heavy on technical detail and was written for a lay audience. For anybody who wants an introduction to the genetics of evolution this a great introduction. Endless Forms Most Beautiful provides a more detail and, I believe, is more engaging.

My only complaint with this book is the formatting of the Kindle edition. It is clear that this book was not formatted specifically for the Kindle. It doesn't cause any problems when reading, but it made me feel like I had an inferior product in my hands.",1

This was the highlight for me. The rest was a wee bit boring & technical.

Clifford J. Stevens,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,A Case of Mistaken Identity,"This book by Sean Carroll is about DNA and the record of ancestry imbedded in DNA, with the presumption that human DNA reveals ancestry from lower mammalian species. I say this is presumed, but it is more than that - it is one of the main theses of the book - unproved, boldly stated - mixing Darwin's ""The Origin of Species"" with Darwin's ""The Descent of Man"" which has never been demonstrated by reliable empirical data.

As a development of Darwin's ""The Origin of Species"", this is a masterly and exhaustive presentation, building on the latest developments in Genomjc Science. But the book makes the same scientific leapfrog that Darwin himself made, in applying Natural Selection and Descent with Modification to the human species - with the unproved assertion that the human race has lts origin in an evolutionary ""leap"" from a ""lower"" species.

It is not the science in this book that is question, it is its flawed concept of the nature of Man. Carroll's concept of Man is incomplete in its catalogue of human powers, identifying Man solely by his biological powers, ignoring that which is specific and exclusive to Homo Sapiens: his intellectual and volitional powers.

By his intellectual powers, Man is greater than the universe, because he can comprehend it, and he is not merely a product of the universe, because he possesses intellectual powers and faculties that transcend it. He also transcends it by works of that intellect in human civilization and culture.

The identification of human DNA with that of other life forms is The most obvious flaw in this book, even though it is a mighty and unprecedented examination of the evolutionary process, discovered by Charles Darwin and so masterfully examined in ""The Origin of Species"".

Evolution is not in question, but the evolution of the human species is. There is specific difference in human beings that is not explained by Nlinkage"" between human beings and ""lower"" animal species.

This book also fails to do it. Homo Sapiens still remains an uncharted continent.

Also - after this amazing lesson in Genomics, and the world of wonder and detail of the biological mechanisms of Natural Selection and Descent with Modification, not to recognize an intelligence behind this biological development indicates a paralysis of judgment that is almost barbaric. Sean Carroll has given in this book the best arguments for the existence of God, based on Science since St. Thomas Aquinas. Congratulations!!!

The Professor,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution,author was not careful with facts,"The book Making of the Fittest is mistitled. It should be titled the survival of the fittest. I looked in vain in this book for a viable mechanism that would supply the new genetic information that selection can select from. Duplicated genes is not new genetic information any more then a photocopy of a book is new information. Furthermore,duplication of genes often causes dosage problems and this is why one of the two X chromosomes in females has to be methylated, a process called dosage compensation. I know no case where clear evidence exists that a duplicated gene has resulted in a survival advantage and many cases where it has caused health problems just as triplet repeat expansion disorders often cause health problems. All claimed cases are in Gould's words just -so-stories.

The problem with Darwinism has always been, not the survival of the fittest, which is well documented, but the arrival of the fittest. Mutations and gene duplication have not been supported by the evidence as a significant source of new genetic information. The first example in the book was about putative loss mutations. Even here the author was not very careful with the facts. He shows that the ""remarkable"" cold water fish on Bouvet Island lack both hemoglobin and red blood cells in its blood, which is only one percent cells by volume (all white blood cells). This is fact.

The author then notes that these fish lack the genes for these structures, which I also assume is fact as this can be determined by sequencing the fish genome. Then the author jumps to the speculation, which may be correct but is not labeled as such, that it lost these genes. It is possible the these fish are a result of convergent evolution, as are many other animals. Convergent evolution is the process whereby organisms that are not closely related independently evolved very similar traits. We cannot assume that all vertebrates involve one single branch of the evolutionary tree.

The classic example of convergent evolution is many marsupials, such as the Thylacine and many placentals such as the Canids are strikingly similar, yet are widely believed to have evolved along very different paths from common ancestors that date back very early in evolution. Another concern is Carroll states that the antifreeze gene arose from part of another entirely unrelated gene. This is a just-so story. The conclusion that it arose from another unrelated gene is based solely on sequence comparisons. It may have arose from this gene but this is, at this point, speculation. One can take any gene and do a Blast search and find similarities with parts of other genes which proves only similarity, not decent with modification. Most journal articles are careful to note this fact, yet popular literature as this book was not.

I collect old science books and therein one finds frequent just-so stories that turned out to be wrong. Whole books have been written on the mistakes of science, some with tragic consequences. We need to stress what is known and what is speculation, otherwise we are misleading the public and will add to the reputation of the absent minded professor who knows everything about nothing, doing trivial research that nobody reads, to come up with foolish ideas.",36
Southern Jameson West,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rosalind Franklin and DNA,A Tragedy in Science,"Dear Readers

I really like this book for a number of reasons. But it is a story that makes me feel quite sorry and kind of sad or disappointed. I believe the facts as reported in the book are fairly accurate and that's not really the problem of course but what concerns me most is the nature of the tragedy this story describes . The disappointment here is that we didn't know the facts earlier.

And there's no way to go back and right the wrong or ""fix the thing"". I am probably a hopeless romantic. But that is how I feel about this case. This person Rosalind Franklin was as described in this book as someone who I would have liked to have known. I used to often chat with a female crystallographer when I was in undergraduate physics and quite often I shared with her my observations about people in physics and she often shared with me what it was like for her working as a Post Doc in crystallography.

She later moved away and some years after that I read the ""Double Helix""...I don't think I finished it at that time but I do remember ""Rosalind"" as she was portrayed in that book and I compared that portrayal to my friend who had been doing crystallography and I wondered what was going on. That was about 1977 or thereabouts. And I didn't really care about the whole affair or DNA at the time until much later when I was actually thrown into Biophysics quite by accident.

And then my own research in DNA took off. And as I began to learn more about DNA I began to take note of all the many different books which had been coming out talking about the discovery and talking about Rosalind Franklin.
Actually alot of the discoveries of these various books was done browsing Amazon.com. I began to get curious about what was going on or what had been going on with regard to the discovery of the structure of DNA. What was the difference between these ""official versions"" (Watson et al.) and now these ""unofficial versions"" of the story.

I wish that the circumstances had been different for Rosalind. We lost a beautiful person and a great crystallographer.....and I wish she could have had the recognition that she was certainly worthy of. (actually we've lost many great minds in science to cancer.....doesn't that strike you as odd?)

The way to resolve the apparent contadiction between this book and say Watson's accounts is to simply realize that the DNA work was under strict government control.
There was no ""intellectual freedom"" that Watson and his guys would like us to believe. Government control is not talked about in Anne Sayre's book. She is trying to look at it in a different way....that there are ""rules of conduct"" in science and that there is/should be some kind of honor system...I agree with her but that didn't apply to this DNA story....it was a government ""setup"" from the beginning.

Caroline Lim,4.0 out of 5 stars,Rosalind Franklin and DNA,What an amazing woman!,"OK, so it's probably a little biased because it's clear that the author was close friends with Ms Franklin, but nonetheless, it painted a very interesting picture of the woman who made many contributions to the scientific field, and who alas, received very little recognition for her work. Certainly James Watson who wrote [The Double Helix] appeared to discredit Ms Franklin almost every time he mentions her, even going so far as giving her a diminutive nickname of 'Rosy'.

This book attempts to not just describe Rosalind's drive in challenging herself and others around her, but delves also into her impressive family history, and through that, we start to see how Rosalind's character was shaped. Her confidence and penchant for discussions, even her enjoyment of dissenting opinions, was sometimes perceived by other less confident individuals as arrogance. She unfortunately, lived in a time when women were merely tolerated but hardly respected in her chosen fields in England. It was only during her years in Paris that she appeared to be at her happiest, where the environment of enthusiastic discussions and information sharing was, for her, simply ideal.

If her environment at King's College had been similar to what she experienced in Paris, it is thought she may have broken the DNA code much sooner. Instead, apart from a student, she worked in isolation. If not for the copious and detailed notes she took and which survived her, we would not have known how far she had come in her DNA research.

Once Crick and Watson had published their paper on DNA, Rosalind, not only wasn't bitter, but she wrote a supporting paper that displayed her delight in the beauty and perfection of the model.",4
Scamp Lumm,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rosalind Franklin and DNA,"""What she touched she adorned""-Aaron Klug","How did I make it through college and graduate level biology courses without knowing Rosalind Franklin's story? I only remember some small talk by some of my fellow classmates that Watson and Crick couldn't have solved the puzzle of DNA without her data. I knew she used x-ray crystallography, didn't know that she considered herself, first and foremost a physical chemist. I knew she was British, I didn't know she was a jewess and that her family had connections with some prominent zionist leaders.

Her story is amazing. All girls considering a career in science should read this book, talk about sexism. I love her personality and attitude. She was steady and focussed, she had no idea that Maurice Wilkins, her equal in the lab, took her pictures out of her desk and shared them with Watson and Crick. She had no inkling that there was a contest. This book is written by her friend who no doubt was hurt by some of the things that Watson wrote about her in his much acclaimed Double Helix.

Anne Sayre refutes Watson's claim, ""This is how science is done."" Their friend Aaron Klug's comment about Rosalind ""What she touched, she adorned,"" is the more noble way of doing science. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, learned about it from an Amazon friend's review. One cannot read The Double Helix without reading this side of the story. Rosalind died a decade before the nobel prize was awarded to Watson and Crick at the age of 37. I love Rosalind's character, what an example to young girls studying science.",3
Jeremy M. Harris,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rosalind Franklin and DNA,"What ""The Double Helix"" didn't tell you","Sayre's book is a biography with an agenda. It is also one of the rare instances where an author is sufficiently thoughtful and objective to keep the agenda from ruining the piece.
Rosalind Franklin was a chemist doing x-ray crystallography on DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in Maurice Wilkins' laboratory at King's College, London. Concurrently, James Watson and Francis Crick were trying to puzzle out DNA's molecular structure in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge. Technically the two institutions were not competitors, because the English scientific establishment had ""ceded"" the DNA problem to King's. The world knows that Watson and Crick were first to publish the correct structure of the substance which encodes and controls every detail of the configuration, development, maintenance and reproduction of living things.
Watson and Crick were the kind of bad boys we generally admire. From positions very low on the Cavendish totem pole, they tunneled under, around and through the decorous conventions of incremental science to snatch a Nobel-caliber breakthrough from the very hands of the people who were supposed (eventually) to produce it. They even had a plausible excuse for ethical shortcuts, because the American superstar-chemist Linus Pauling, unconstrained by British decorum, was known to be working on the DNA structure.
In 1968, Watson published ""The Double Helix"", an entertaining and irreverent personal account of the triumph he and Crick had achieved in 1953. On the positive side, the book gave many people (including myself) their first look at the fascinating scientific and human details of a brilliant achievement in the relatively new field of molecular biology. On the negative side, Watson's version of the story did not please everyone who had prior knowledge of the people and events involved. Among the least pleased, to put it mildly, were the family and friends of Rosalind Franklin (Ms. Franklin herself did not live to see the cruelly caricatured ""Rosy"" that Watson sketched for his largely naive and trusting audience.)
One of the friends, Anne Sayre, took on the task of providing a comprehensive portrait of Franklin, interwoven with a retelling of the DNA story centered on the tragic consequences flowing from the simple inability of two intelligent people (Franklin and Wilkins) to get along. But the book is much more than a psychological study. Sayre documents some unambiguous facts that establish what Franklin knew about DNA and when she knew it. Also revealed are the instances in which her work was used without her knowledge and, even more unfortunately, the degree to which misunderstanding of Franklin's conclusions about the B-form of DNA slowed everyone's progress and robbed her of due credit.
I found Sayre to be unfailingly perceptive and balanced while following a course of strong, even indignant, advocacy. This is no mean feat, and follows in part from her extensive interviews with all the principals, as well as fruitful discussions with her scientist husband. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in gaining perspective on the DNA story, and on science itself.",87

But when I picked it up I found myself drawn into a topic I know little about. Dr. Quackenbush's book makes mapping the human genome perfectly understandable. He writes of his early physics training: ""I soon learned that biology was undergoing a revolution as profound as that which had occurred in physics in the late 1800s and early 1900s when... new methods of investigation set the stage for people like Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrodinger, and Albert Einstein to dramatically alter our understanding of the universe."" So it is today. By combining biology, computer science, and information technology Dr. Q is able to map the human genome sequence--data that leads to ""major advances in understanding, diagnosing, and treating disease."" Dr. Quackenbush is a computational biologist at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. The new technologies might actually lead to more effective treatments and managements of disease.

Yet here, in clear and concise language, Dr. Quackenbush, as the title aptly describes, gives us the 'essential knowledge' to understand the kind of unbelievable changes the Human Genome Project will bring to us as a species.

We are bombarded with hyperbole, often about belief systems that have no basis whatsoever in science. When a book like this is written, it's hard to underestimate its importance. Ultimately the Genomic information that he describes has the power to cure thousands of diseases, and will bring revolutions in medicine, and all aspects of biology, including horticulture, crop production, and evolution itself.

Not only does Dr Quackenbush give us the basic history of the scientific discoveries that led to the continuing success of The Human Genome Project, he reviews the biological mechanics of heredity, growth, disease, and evolution of the human race.

In the Afterward, we get to appreciate the extraordinary set of intellectual and scholarly talents that Dr Quackenbush brings to this book. He is a man of superb intellect, impressive achievements and is a respected scientist in his field. His understanding of the recent medical and technological breakthroughs, and his ability to condense and synthesize them, is why this book is such a success. This is no small task, giving the complexity and the number of different fields that were directly involved in the HGP.

I really enjoyed how Quackenbush applied the work and discoveries of the HGP to real-life issues that we are all dealing with everyday. In particular, he covers the genetic foundations of cancer, something that I have recently had to deal with in my family.

The book is written for people with little to no knowledge about biology or genetics. Anyone who has taken college level biology, like myself, might find the book a mundane review, as I did.

Daniel Putman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA,Strong biography of a brilliant and complex scientist,"Rosalind Franklin has become a touchstone for debate in science. Franklin, fierce in her determination for accurate scientific data under very difficult social circumstances, died tragically of cancer at age 37. Whether her data was unfairly or unethically used by Watson and Crick in putting together the model for the double helix will be a contentious issue for a long time to come. Into this extremely difficult and emotionally loaded historical drama comes one of the better biographies of a scientist on the market today, Brenda Maddox’s biography of Rosalind Franklin.

After a somewhat slow start the book becomes one that is hard to put down. Maddox is meticulously fair in pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of Franklin’s personality and is equally precise about the sequence of events in the discovery of the DNA helix. She leaves much of the decision to the reader to judge whether or not Franklin’s amazing photograph of the “B” form of DNA and her other data were unethically appropriated by Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins. Maddox also gives a precise description of when and how Franklin herself came to the realization of both the helical form of DNA and the fact that it has two chains. She gives Watson’s picture of Franklin in The Double Helix the critique it deserves. But Maddox also points out throughout the book how the intense and deeply focused Franklin dealt with other scientists and how a laboratory's social environment and personnel affected Franklin's behavior.

I also read the shorter biography of Franklin by her close friend Anne Sayre. That book is much more personal and parts are clearly designed to counteract what is said about Franklin in The Double Helix. While Sayre’s book is a strong corrective to the portrayal of Franklin in Watson’s book, if you are looking for a better all-round picture of this remarkable scientist, I would recommend this book. It will leave you in more of a moral quandary but that is not a criticism of Maddox. The situation was complex with rules (unwritten but with powerful gender and class overtones) that may (or may not) have been broken. The last few chapters may move you deeply. Franklin’s scientific life after leaving King’s and her later life with cancer are an especially compelling portrait of this woman and the part of her life that rarely makes the popular headlines. This is an excellent biography that fills in well the complicated picture surrounding the discovery that changed human history.",1
John W. Stahl,3.0 out of 5 stars,Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA,Flawed but interesting and enjoyable,"Biographers always run the risk of falling in love with their subjects. I think Maddox is overly defensive of Franklin, to the point of gratuitously criticizing Franklin's ""competitors."" It smacked of sour grapes, and it was unnecesary. I doubt there's a student of cell biology today who doesn't revere Franklin as one of the very most influential and important contributors to the understanding of nucleic acids - Franklin is simply a giant in the field, and she needs no defense. Perhaps one must be a student of science, not a writer, to understand this.
The detailed research into Franklin's family dynamics was interesting, and the description of her vacations was enlightening. Considering her body of work, it's amazing that she took so many long vacations.
I found the electronic version poorly edited. There were multiple spelling errors, numerous typos (! instead of 1) and Schrodinger always had a space in it (Schro dinger.) The author deserved better.",4

Whatever views individuals may hold about the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), this book certainly contains plenty of information about this discovery which will cause some to modify their views and others to strengthen their existing opinions.

Brenda Maddox makes clear that many of the misunderstandings that arose later, were largely caused by J T. Randall's (Head of the biophysics laboratory at King's College, London) initial instructions to her which led her to believe `she would have the X-ray work to herself, p. 114'. However he gave a different impression of Rosalind's status to his deputy, Maurice Wilkins, who was in day to day contact with Rosalind. This blurring of issues eventually led to Rosalind and Maurice being permanently at loggerheads, whilst making life exceptionally difficult for the Ph. D student Raymond Gosling who was jointly supervised by Rosalind and Maurice.

Brenda Maddox develops her theme carefully and systematically, so that at some times the reader feels an intense sympathy for Rosalind whilst at other times one feels that she is the cause of her own misfortunes. The outcome is well-known; Rosalind took some amazingly good photographs of DNA which were taken without her consent and gave the researchers at Cambridge, James Watson and Francis Crick, the insight to build the double helix model of DNA. Later, after the early death of Rosalind Franklin in April, 1958, Crick, Watson and Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1962. In February, 1968, Watson published `The double helix' which presented the story of the discovery of DNA from his point of view, presenting a negative view of Rosalind Franklin.

One thought that I gained from this book, which presents many moral problems to the reader, is that the issues seem more important now than they did at the time. After leaving King's Rosalind set up important new research areas under J. D. Bernal at Birkbeck College, London and appears to have been unaware of how her earlier research had been used.

It is an excellent book that all interested in the progress of science should read.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA,A Revelation,"As a career scientist and woman I am stunned (and embarrassed) that I did not know the full story of Rosalind Franklin before reading this book. Brenda Maddox sensitively tells the tale of a brilliant Jewish girl in WWII England who struggles to make a career and her mark in science. That Rosalind became a world renowned crystallographer is a testament to her inner strength and surpassing intellectual gifts; the legacy of her scientific achievement makes hers an important history. But Rosalind's story is raised to Tragedy by 2 facts. The first is that she was betrayed by some of the most regaled scientists of modern biology - Watson, Crick and Wilkins - who, when rewarded with the Nobel, did not acknowledge that Rosalind's work was integral to their uncovering the structure of DNA's double helix. This scientific theft moves into the tragic realm with the second fact -the ""Dark Lady"" was stricken with ovarian cancer and died within several years of her discovery - allowing this personal betrayal to go without answer.

No, this book is not a feminist polemic. It is a story of grace under duress, a story of courage, and beauty and permanence. In sum, Rosalind's personal and scientific life is the story of a soul that burned laser bright. She is the person that I would most like to meet, were that possible, and I thank Brenda Maddox for introducing her to me.",7

And this is after high school that I heard about her. She truely is a remarkable women and unfortunately lives the shadows now. Not very many people know about her and what she accomplished.

K. M. Pollard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA,Franklin's real biography,"Brenda Maddox does a masterful job of laying out the life story of Rosalind Franklin, the supposed ""forgotten lady of DNA"". This biography is far superior to the personal vendetta waged against J D Watson on Franklin's behalf by Anne Sayre (see my comments on ""Rosalind Franklin and DNA"" by Anne Sayre).
Rosalind Franklin is the King's College scientist who obtained the x-ray photograph of the B form of DNA which was an important piece of information in the eventual description of a model of the structure of DNA that was described by J D Watson and FHC Crick in 1953, and for which they, along with Maurice Wilkins, won the Nobel Prize. Much has been written about whether Franklin was robbed of credit for her DNA contribution, whether she would have determined the structure by herself, and whether she would have shared in the Nobel. Whether these things are true or may have come to pass is difficult to say. Franklin died in 1958 and without her answers to some of these questions we are only left to speculate.
However Maddox leaves little speculation about who Rosalind Franklin was. This is a model biography of a true pioneer and an excellent role model for those seeking a career in the sciences. My own career was greatly influenced by Watson's personal account of the description of the model DNA structure he and Crick proposed. At that time (1971) I was more taken with the intuitive thinking displayed by the protagonists and their after hours antics than by the portrayal of ""Rosy"". In following years I have read Sayre and also Crick and others and have been somewhat bemused by the situation that surrounds Franklin and DNA, perhaps because it is almost all personal opinion and speculation. Maddox's picture is none of this. Her book is the description of a talented, strong-willed, opinioned female scientist and yes, a feminist. There is little doubt that Franklin made significant scientific contributions. There is also little doubt that she was emotionally immature and fragile. There is even less doubt that she died far, far, far too young but with great dignity and spirit. The first chapters on the pre-Rosalind history of the Franklin's is slow going but the reader is more than compensated by the final chapters that touchingly describe Franklin's last months. In her last few years we see a woman making her place in a man's world, and doing it very successfully. Her emotional life may even have been close to being fulfilled. But abdominal pains herald the beginning of repeated cancer treatments which culminate in her death before her work on viral structure was to be displayed in exhibition. Watson's book is fun, an easy read about how science is done (by some) but Rosalind's story is filled with overwhelming emotion about how a life was lived and cut short. She was robbed of the only real prize - life.",91
Donald J. Keck,2.0 out of 5 stars,Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA,Who Discoverd the Structure of DNA?,"Brenda Maddox' ROSALIND FRANKLIN: THE DARK LADY OF DNA and ROSALIND FRANKLIN AND DNA by Anne Sayre both imply that Rosalind Franklin was the true discoverer of DNA and that James Watson & Francis Crick, with the help of Maurice Wilkins, stole her discovery.

Rosalind Franklin was no doubt an excellent scientist, a molecular biologist, who, along with Linus Paulding in the US, sought to solve the puzzle of DNA. She was a painstaking researcher, who compiled much of the fundamental data on the subject (in the form of x-ray photos of DNA). Her work provided the crucial information that enabled Watson & Crick to make their breakthrough discovery of the structure of DNA.

But the fact remains that, while she had the information, she did not make the discovery. Watson & Crick did. Could she have arrived at their conclusion give more time and more research? Perhaps. But the question is irrelevant. She didn't. They did. Watson & Crick did not ""steal"" her discovery. They made it on their own - no doubt with the invaluable help of her data.

But that is the way scientific discoveries are made. The great breakthroughs are always based on previous inconclusive research and data compiled by other scientists. Such information is the common property of the scientific community, not the private property of individual researchers. Progress is made through the sharing of data, studies and findings. Science progresses not in secret, but through an open system of shared information.

The credit for any scientific discovery goes to those who reach the solution first, not to those who work toward the solution or provide the data on which the solution is ultimately based.

The fact is that such discoveries are often the result of a combination of painstaking research and illuminating insight. Rosalind Franklin was a painstaking researcher. But it was Watson & Crick who had the brilliant insight.

I believe that this episode is an example of Thomas Kuhn's theory of the function of paradigms - the framework of existing concepts that dominate any field of human endeavor. The effect of paradigms is to ""blind"" those who work within the existing conceptual framework to possibilities that become visible to those who work ""outside the box,"" - i.e. outside the paradigm. To work within an existing paradigm is to expect a certain solution and, inevitably, to look for that solution.

I believe that this is probably what happened with the discovery of DNA. While Rosalind Franklin was working within the framework of the existing molecular biological paradigm, Watson & Crick stepped outside the box and were able to view the data in a new and different way. This was because neither Watson (a zoologist & bacteriologist) nor Crick (a physicist turned chemist) were molecular biologists and were therefore not trapped in the existing paradigm of molecular biology. This enabled them to see what Franklin and Paulding didn't see. Therefore, it was Watson & Crick who became the discoverers of the structure of DNA and received the credit, and the Nobel Prize they fully deserved.

To give Rosalind Franklin credit for the research she did and the data she so painstakingly assembled (data which enabled Watson & Crick to make their breakthrough discovery) is a generous thing. But for these authors to imply that they ""stole"" her discovery is inaccurate. It has far less to do with the pursuit of scientific or historic truth than it does with the pursuit of a feminist agenda.",21

Abhishek Prasad,5.0 out of 5 stars,RNA: Life's Indispensable Molecule,"""Those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it"".","Well, in science, the ability to repeat things (reproducibility) is actually desirable, but you get my point... :)

As a scientist myself (whose work involves quite a bit of RNA biology), I've always been interested in the history behind the amazing discoveries in science. We tend to take for granted the seemingly simple truths we know today: e.g. DNA is the genetic material of inheritance (with the exception of some viruses of course), the genetic code, etc. But finding those truths was far from simple: men and women spent years, often times decades of their lives answering those questions. It is easy to forget sometimes that we didn't always know what we know.

This is a history book. It starts from the foundations of molecular biology...early investigations of proteins (which were long suspected to play the role that we now know DNA does), discovery of ""nuclein"" (DNA), etc. Dr. James Darnell, an accomplished RNA researcher himself, gives you the who, where, what, why, and how of the major discoveries in molecular biology, leading to the specialized field of RNA biology. We see how RNA went from being thought of as a rather uninteresting biomolecule to the multi-functional, extremely diverse class of molecules we know it is today. Reproductions of figures from key papers are presented to illustrate those discoveries. The book leads us to the current day work in small non-coding RNAs.

All in all, this is a wonderful book for the biology/molecular biology/biochemistry undergraduate, graduate, or professor. You likely will need some background knowledge in basic molecular biology/genetics, but if you have that foundation, this book will be a valuable read.",7
Neil Scott Mcnutt,5.0 out of 5 stars,RNA: Life's Indispensable Molecule,A hard but exciting road to greatness,"Our expert guide is Dr. James Darnell, a honored senior scientist at the Rockefeller University in New York City. Dr. Darnell spent many years at the laboratory bench. His early work on viruses includes investigation of poliovirus at a time when there was no immunization against it, true dedication! The first chapter in his book recounts the early days of protein chemistry and chemical analysis of chromosomes, which led to the assertion that DNA was the genetic material , by Avery, Macleod, and McCarty. With the Watson and Crick model of DNA, a whole new era began. In Chapter 2, Darnell emphasizes that precise genetic information is present in both DNA and RNA. Using extracts from plant viruses, Darnell proved that the plant viruses he studied had 3% RNA and no DNA. This indicated the importance of RNA. In the bacterial genome, studies led to the discovery of ""Messenger RNA"" as an important template for protein synthesis. Messenger RNA permitted the rapid starting and stopping of enzyme synthesis. The concept emerged of a comma-less triplet code that must be read from a fixed starting point three bases at a time (A Nobel Prize for Severo Ochoa). The discussion continues to include ""start and stop"" signals, nonsense codons and mis-sense mutants when the wrong amino acid was inserted. In careful experiments, Darnell and colleagues were able to characterize four nuclear RNA species. The later discovery, by David Baltimore, of reverse transcriptase made it possible to copy RNA into DNA. Throughout Dr. Darnell's book, he has placed many drawings about the exact way that these little proteins interact with each other. These diagrams make it possible to understand the fine aspects of the interactions of these proteins, making possible a great learning experience. A short, very readable, section at the end of the book has some interesting thoughts about the origins of life.",4

Mike Blaszczak,4.0 out of 5 stars,Algorithms on Trees and Graphs,Intersting Studies Hampered by LEDA and LP Dependencies,"I'm pleased with the text in this book; the descriptions are almost all clear, and reading through the book gives me insight into some more interesting problems in trees and graphs. The high points of the book are its treaments of tree and graph isomorphism, but I also found the discussions of non-traditional traversal algorithms on trees and graphs very interesting. The author discussions leaf-first, breadth-first, and depth-first traversals and provides algorithms for their implementation. Many of the algorithms include correctness proofs.
These topics alone made the book worth its to me. A deep academic book that costs less than $50 is nearly unheared-of.
Unfortunately, there are two flaws that make the book hard to use. In a nutshell, the author expects the reader to buy into a couple of pretty invasive and expensive propositions.
First, the author decided to use literate programming for all of his presented algorithms and code fragments. This isn't so bad, since literate programming is about documenting code. If you suppose that the author wrote the code, then documented it, then calld it a book, using a tool like literate programming seems like a natural choice.
But if you're not familiar with literate programming, it's a bit of a chore. The author's introduction to literate programming doesn't help with some of the questions even an experienced programmer might have wend reading the text. More practically, literate programming enforces operators that are different than most C/C++ developers are familiar with, and can cause confusion when reading the text. ^ is used, for example, to indicate a logical and, where C/C++ developers expect it to indicate a bitwise-exclusive or.
While it's esay to eventually overcome such tricks of memory, I've been finding it hard to scan literate programs to find definitions and declarations. The author doesn't include a CD (and at this cover price, that is hard to fault) but also doesn't make his code available for download. His website includes a LEDA-based program that interactively demonstrates some algorithms, but doesn't include code for the algorithm his own books develops and discusses.
The other decision made by the author, to the overwhelming inconvenience of this reader, is the reliance on the LEDA library for his samples and programs. The algorithms are understandable without the library, but a reader without access to LEDA doesn't benefit from any of the visualizations the author provides. , and several include
In fact, the author spends about 40 pages discussing LEDA and the characteristics of its implementation. Maybe researchers working on tree and graph algorithms all use LEDA and have ready access to it, but the literate programming code provided to for some of the algorithms isn't useful to readers who aren't familiar with LEDA, as researching the definitions and declarations themsleves becomes arduous.
The bibliography is very diverse, with more than 380 entries and is well-cited throughout the book. Unfortunately, the author sometimes relies on the bibliography too much. On page 392, the author brings up ""the so-called graph isopomorphism disease"" without defining it himself; he instead relies on his bibliography entries to give the user any definition or background on the ""disease"".

Unfortunately, the index received not nearly as much attention as the bibliography; neglecting whitespace, it's scarcely more than a single page long!
The book appears to be something more than a research paper, but is written much like a research apper would be. The book probably also serves well for a class that teaches this subject, and assumes LEDA and literate programming as prerequisites. But as a commercial developer who's interested in applying advanced graph and tree algorithms to the work I'm doing, I found the book has limited its value by relying on LEDA and applying literate programming.
All this said, I still feel it's appropriate to give the book four stars. The material covered is hard to find elsewhere, and with some effort I can overcome the LEDA and literate programming hurdles. Since I don't use LEDA or literate programming day-to-day, I'll have to overcome that unfamiliarity every time I pick up the book as a reference.",40
MedIT,4.0 out of 5 stars,Biomedical Informatics: Computer Applications in Health Care and Biomedicine (Health Informatics),Gold Standard w/ Limitations of Edited Volume,"This seems to be the gold standard in the field, and deservedly so. I've seen it selected as the book for almost every intro Informatics course I've been exposed to. I've read all but three chapters (13,15, and 21) of it and found that in general the chapters are quite strong. Because it is an edited volume the quality and style of the chapters are mixed. The chapters are, without exception, meticulously sourced making the references section a real gem. The questions at the end of the chapter wouldn't be close to adequate for a self study book (I'd say they are only slightly more than perfunctory).

I think this book has two limitations:
- Lacks any substantive cross chapter continuity (on the upside this means it can really be read in almost any order).
- The chapter length to depth ratio is unfavorable. At an average of 40ish pages the chapters should really be able to get into real technical depth; instead, it seems to gloss over the technical details with repetitions of ""gee whiz"" platitudes.

I think this book has one annoyance:
- A lot of the contents (particularly in the first few chapters of the book) have an ""in the future we'll all drive flying cars"" feel that makes them more dated than the publication date would suggest.

I understand it must be difficult to write an intro text that serves a wide audience, but two things:

1. A little verbose. I have read 3 chapters so far, and it seems like the book does not need to be quite so thick.

2. The diagrams in chapter 1 especially are an embarrassment to textbook writers, editors, and publishers, and an insult to anyone who purchased this book. If anyone is wondering what makes students so angry at spending $100 for a textbook, note the gem of a diagram on page 17. It's a mess of squiggly lines connecting boxes of text. What's that thick black line running through the center? Some sort of trend in a graph? No, it's the Internet, in what is presumably a network diagram. It really looks like it was drawn by someone in MS Paint, who was unable to discover the tool that draws a straight line.

Wendell S. Read,5.0 out of 5 stars,Genomic Control Process: Development and Evolution,A fascinating book,"I am a non-biologist, but I have often wondered how the information in the genome (the DNA) is used to 'build' a mature organism. In so far as it is currently known, this book provides the answer. My concern however was that since I only have a smattering of self-taught biological information, would I be able to make good use of the book.? The answer is a qualified 'yes'. The concepts presented are clear and understandable. They are however often followed by examples to illustrate the points being made which require specialized biological knowledge which I do not have. An example:

""The developmental context or cell type in which the histones around a particular gene will be modified thus depends on expression of both the recruiting transcription factor and the modification enzyme. From what we now know the genome encodes many fewer modification enzymes than it does transcription factors. Thus the same enzymes are recruited by different regulatory factors, depending on the cellular context. For example, the lysine methyltransferase G9a catalyzes H3K9 dimethylation, which is often associated with transcriptional repression. In liver cells, G9a is recruited by the transcription factor E4bp4 to the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and is required for the repression of this gene ( Tong et al., 2013 ).""

I have not yet finished the book, but I am enthusiastically pushing ahead. It is a truly fascinating description of our current understanding of the development of organisms, and the profound implication this information has on evolutionary processes.",4

But I worked about two decades later, of course. I knew this in 1980 when I started working in that room because there is a small bronze plaque on the wall just outside the door. Not much detail about Nirenberg’s life had been published, so when I saw this new book released I ordered it immediately because of this bit of a (remote) personal connection. I enjoyed the book and I recommend it, although it would have been nice to have a bit more illumination of the step by step technical detail. For example, Nirenberg might still have had available at the time of the interview some of his old laboratory notebooks, and it would have been historically fascinating to show multiple key notebook pages along with a running commentary from Nirenberg referring to those pages. That material could have been placed in an appendix. If Frank Portugal sees this review, he could look at an example of showing notebook pages within Gerald Geison's book, ""The Private Science of Louis Pasteur."" I tried something like that in my own autobiography even though I am just an ordinary clinician-scientist trying to do good work and who will never win a Nobel (I guess my autobiography could have been titled ""The Even Less Likely Man,"" but the title actually is ""Free To Decide: Building a Life in Science and Medicine"").

reviewer #1,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Least Likely Man: Marshall Nirenberg and the Discovery of the Genetic Code (MIT Press),biography at its worst: how to spoil an extremely interesting story by poor wriring,"I am an avid reader of history of science books, and was very excited to see this new book about marshall nirenberg. I bought it right away and started reading it as soon as it arrived. My disappointment couldn't be stronger. The writing in this book is simply terrible. I am just surprised that nobody in MIT press has bothered to read it, because there are flagrant flaws in this book that any minimally competent editor should have detected before sending this piece of garbage to print. The book is written by franklin portugal, who wrote a very authoritative book on the history of DNA before. However, this book appears to be written in a carelessly, unprofessional manner, to the point that it is really painful to read its meager 140 pages. For example, in every single page of the book there is a comment such ""..as this is what led marshall to the nobel prize.."", or ""..that was the missing piece that will get marshall her nobel prize.."". After a while, it just gets tiring.
The worst part is in the last chapter, when describing a party organized to commemorate the elucidation of the genetic code. That party took place in the cosmos club in D.C. Why does the author spend some 8 pages describing the cosmos club history, its architecture, the fact that women were not allowed as members, etc... Doesn't the author have anything more interesting to talk about than these irrelevant details about this club?

I only have two good things to say:
(1)because it was short(140 pages), you can read it in one sitting without wasting too much time on this piece of historical garbage.

(2) I am glad that marshall nirenberg passed away before this garbage was published. This is NOT the biography that a giant such as nirenberg deserved.",4
Kyle,1.0 out of 5 stars,Impact of Healthcare Informatics on Quality of Patient Care and Health Services,Typos on first page. Oh boy...,"This book seems to be written in the form of a research paper, not a college textbook. It's quite wordy, but really doesn't impart a lot of useful information. It is rather short, as well. I knew I was in for frustration when on the first page HIPAA is stated to be the ""Health Information Privacy and Accountability Act"", which is incorrect. Every mention of HIPAA makes this same mistake, including the index. It should instead be ""Health Information Portability and Accountability Act"".

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bioconductor Case Studies (Use R!),"Awful book, period!","I am loathe to write this review, but I feel compelled to. This is really an awful, awful book. There is no plan for the book in terms of trying to teach the reader the methods of analysis of Bioconductor in a structured way. All the chapters of the book seem like a patchwork which begin somewhere and end abruptly without any consistency. It is highly puzzling for me since the Bioconductor package seems to relatively well thought out overall. When it comes to writing books, all the authors associated with the Bioconductor seem to abruptly and inexplicably fail. This leads to conclude TWO things 1) The authors do not want the general reader to learn the analysis 2) They are just awful writers. I have used the other official ""Bioconductor"" books too and they are equally awful too. 0 out of 3 is not a good record. Rather than try to make money off gullible public by peddling incremental and useless books, please try to write a book which will truly educate someone. Please give it a try. I assure you, you will better about yourselves. The 2 stars are for the effort. That's all. I understand this is a scathing review.

Leonbergerlover,5.0 out of 5 stars,Epigenetics,EPIGENETICS,The textbook EPIGENETICS is an excellent text in this subjec.

Dr. Terrence McGarty,5.0 out of 5 stars,From Genes to Genomes: Concepts and Applications of DNA Technology,Fantastic Overview and Useful to All,"The book by Dale, Von Schantz and Platt, From Genes to Genomes, is almost perfect. It is a 350 or so page exceptionally well written book describing all the introductory materials one would need to become current with genomes and genomics efforts. As with many of the other books I had around I first looked at this and at a glance set it aside. Then came the moment when I wanted to re-understand something and I opened this book up and I was hooked. It in a clean and clear manner takes the reader from basic DNA principles and through all of the key techniques used in genomic studies today. It avoids getting to complex into any one area and it reads in a straightforward and consistent manner. It is a superb asset for “catching up” and I suspect for first learning the materials.

Chapter 1 is the basic introduction to genes and genomes. It is DNA 101 but it contains little tidbits of essential materials that are all well integrated. One thus starts with a clear understanding where the authors are taking the reader.

Chapter 2 is the material on basic gene cloning. It uses the plasmid approach with bacteriophage and does so without burdening the reader with too much overhead and history. This Chapter discusses technique and technology and the reader is given a logical approach to the basics of cloning. Restriction enzymes are introduced and the material is adequate to have enough depth to see how they can be applied. There are, of course, a lot of implementation questions that are left hanging but that is typical of this study. There is a section on ligation and I would like to have seen this carried over a bit when discussing gene knock-outs. We can understand how the genes ligate but the question is how well does this carry-over the later processes.

Chapter 3 discusses DNA libraries. This is a wonderful summary of the concept. The graphics supplement the text without over powering it. One example of what I call the cook book facts is demonstrated in p 95 when discussing hybridization. Here is the curve showing how as temperature increases the DNA starts to break apart. This is the denaturing of DNA, a concept again used with the PCR analysis. This is less a theoretical or structure issue but one of those cook-book facts that have been added to the tool chest of the Genome builder.

Chapter 4 is the PCR process. Simply it is the separating of DNA, then tagging one end and the other end and going through a temperature sensitive denaturing and rebuilding until what is left is millions of copies of a desired DNA segment. My only complaint here is that the graphic, good, albeit it could be made a bit better with color.

Chapter 5 discusses sequencing and it gives a superb discussion of the Sanger approach. Namely ddNTPs are used with segments and then measured in a gel electrophoresis. I assume that the reader may have had some understanding of the physical details but overall it is clear and exceptionally useful.

The text continues developing other elements used in current day genomics. Chapter 9 is an attempt to provide an overview of microarrays, SNP, and even GWAS and phylogenetics. My problem here is that they are trying to stretch it a bit too far. These are reasonable summaries but to do microarrays justice it may take a bit more detail, and yes color, and the phylogenetics is much too much just a high level summary.

Finally the Glossary is fantastic and worth every page.

The strengths and weakness of the book are simple. On the strength side it covers all the key issues superbly. On the negative side, and this may be perhaps me, I find that almost like Organic Chemistry, in Gene manipulation there still are many cookbook rules that are scattered between the facts and logical constructs. If somehow there could be a clarification of the cook book rule and the well understood logical steps that would be a help.

Overall I would highly recommend this book for almost anyone, from beginner to professional. My focus is clinical and theoretical modelling and analysis, and I have avoided bench work as much as possible. But by reading this book I can see again how much work has been done over the past few decades.",6
Susan K. S. Zawacky,5.0 out of 5 stars,From Genes to Genomes: Concepts and Applications of DNA Technology,A really helpful and clear introduction to genomics,"This book is really valuable for someone who wants to start learning about genomics. It begins with an introduction to molecular biology in terms of what DNA is in chapter 1, and it goes on from there through how to clone a gene in chapter 2, including short descriptions of important laboratory methods, through genomic libraries in chapter 3, and on to genomic analysis in chapter 8, analysis of genetic variation in chapter 9, and post-genomic analysis in chapter 10. The tone is clear and non-patronizing, and the order and organization of topics is very well-planned, so that earlier material does provide background to understand what comes later. The authors assume only a background equivalent to college freshman biology and chemistry--the reader needs to understand what covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds are, and why covalent bonds are much harder to break. The book includes lots of diagrams, a glossary, a bibliography (print and websites), and an index at the end. For a serious book on science this book is quite readable, but it is not a beach read. It is a user-friendly textbook, so that many readers will find it helpful to read some chapters more than once. The book is a valuable introduction to the extremely important field of genomics.

Here is a listing of chapter titles:
1. From Genes to Genomes
2. How to Clone a Gene
3. Genomic and cDNA Libraries
4. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
5. Sequencing a Cloned Gene
6. Analysis of Gene Expression
7. Products from Native and Manipulated Cloned Genes

Hyokun Yun,5.0 out of 5 stars,Probability for Statistics and Machine Learning: Fundamentals and Advanced Topics (Springer Texts in Statistics),Perfect companion for users of probability theory,"I strongly recommend this book as a reference book for those who apply probability theory in their work: computer scientists, applied statisticians, industrial engineers and so on. This book is very comprehensive: in every topic this book discusses, from very basic undergrad facts to modern probability theory results are all covered. What is remarkable, is that Prof. DasGupta has managed to explain all of these in very high level, avoiding messing up the intuitive message with mathematical jargons. In particular, he avoids the use of measure theory as much as possible, and it is amazing that such a comprehensive book on probability can be written with this much use of measure theory! Therefore, for non-probabilists this is an wonderful reference to extract useful results and intuition from probability theory, without investing too much time on struggling with mathematical techniques. For hard-core mathematics people, this is still a good book for both learn and reference, but for rigorous proofs you should follow the reference given in the book.",7
Adamg,1.0 out of 5 stars,Probability for Statistics and Machine Learning: Fundamentals and Advanced Topics (Springer Texts in Statistics),"Material is okay, very hard to read in kindle","Firstly, let me say that I gave the book one star, so it would average 3 stars. The only other review of this book, which is written by a Purdue professor, is by a Purdue graduate student. He gave the book 5 stars, which I think is overly enthusiastic. Why was he overly enthusiastic, you will have to draw your own conclusions.
Firstly, unless you are very happy with the kindle medium, this is not the book for you. It lacks a TOC, which is a huge drawback. There are a certain number of links to figures that work, but navigating through the book is hard. I've read a number of books on kindle, but I still prefer paper because of this issue of 'flipping through' to find something. Beware, this book is only for people who are very okay with the kindle medium. I found navigation particularly difficult.
I have only read the section on martingales so far. I have no issues with measure theory (I have a math phd and I actually learned analysis from Zygmund !), but I think the idea of keeping the measure theory out of the exposition is an excellent one. For all but the most serious students of analysis, the measure theory aspect of the subject is a formalism and it just adds confusion.

L. D. Rafey,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Art of Genes: How Organisms Make Themselves,The New Genetics,"As a High School student, I made many an inquiry into the very questions that this text (and other more recently published texts) seeks to answer or to explain. I was rebuffed by many a teacher then as well as in my later colligiate days as if I had asked something absurd like ""what is God made of?"" . Yet, just the street from my home as a youth, Kornberg was working on the elucidation of DNA Polymerase and across the pond, Watson and Crick were on the verge of deciphering the enigmatic DNA molecule. All this excitement and still, no real answers for nearly fifty years. This book by Coen is an absolutely wonderfully well composed and well written text that elucidates in great depth the real mystery that is the product of our genes. No longer concerned with the humdrum mechanics and mere architecture of DNA, it reveals the real magic and dynamics of the stuff that has for so long eluded such inquiring minds as my own. As a former research Microbiologist and avocational artist, I found E.Coen's analogy a genuinely perfect metaphor for representing the dynamics of the gene. I have reviewed many similar texts, each of which were excellent in their approach to this subject but I choose this text as a particularly marvelous text for both the professional and layperson alike to read for a comprehensive understanding of the true miracle of living matter.",3

Richard G. Colling,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,Super Summary of the Scientific Insights Establishing Humanity's Connectedness with all Life on Earth,"Finding a way to communicate the recent discoveries in Genetics that establish evolution as undeniable presents a substantial challenge. Simply put, Daniel Fairbanks does a truly outstanding job of laying out the evidence without getting bogged down in either scientific minutiae or cultural/religious dogma. Concise, clear, compelling, and carefully crafted to dispel what Fairbanks describes as a ""false dichotomy"" that pits evolution against religion and belief in God. The scientific/genetic concepts are complex, but Fairbanks does a masterful job of illustrating the concepts in language understandable to non-scientists who truly want to understand evolution.
I have not seen a better work on this topic anywhere. This is must-read (and understand) material for all religious leaders for whom evolution is a stumbling block - either for themselves or their parishioners. It provides a solid scientific foundation for evolution, and thus serves as an excellent beginning point for discussion of how Christianity, God, and religious faith in general might be raised to a new level interpretation and personal/corporate experience. Any Christian who believes that the reality of evolution can continue to disputed owes it to themselves to be cognizant of this material before they utter a single word to anyone. Knowledge is empowering! Fairbanks has done a great service to the Christian faith in revealing these new scientific/genetic insights in such clear fashion.",2
Michael Heath,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,Reaching reasonable certainty by way of overwhelming evidence,"Fairbanks' book takes off at a sprint, kicking off with the report on one of the most impressive discoveries in molecular biology, the history and recent validation of the fusion of our chromosome 2 with an additional chromosome we possessed that is nearly exactly the same as the additional chromosome of other great apes (as is our current chromosome 2 when compared to other great apes' chromosome 2A. Any one who has been guided through the past and current structure of these two chromosomes can not reasonably doubt their evolutionary history of once having been two chromosomes at one point identical to other great apes who shared a common ancestry with homo sapiens. That's because this one chromosome still has the attributes of an additional chromosome. Fairbanks doesn't merely provide the finding, he expertly explains the physical evidence, with the helpful use of diagrams that causes this form of physical evidence to be so convincing to anyone who authentically seeks understanding. Fairbanks also preempts any anticipated contradictory arguments by non-scientists creationists; not by mere rhetoric, but instead via a rational accounting of the physical evidence as it is understood not merely by him, but as it has been independently reviewed and accepted by his peers in the field of molecular biology.

While I was cognizant of this fairly recent discovery and expected its inclusion in the book, I wondered how Fairbanks could top that explosive find to keep the book compelling given its position early in the book. Compelling though it is, Fairbanks goes on to provide discovery after discovery that moves deep into the structure of DNA. One of the more fascinating tutorials was how the mutations that occur over time are utilized by species when their environment changes, where Fairbanks does an expert job of explaining how mutations are leveraged by natural selection. He follows this summary with an explanation, supported again by overwhelming evidence; on how populations evolve to the point they are now a different species. In fact his reportage in this area was the most impressive I've encountered in all my general science reading. This is especially important when making an argument for evolution in human DNA coupled to the reality that most non-scientists do not understand the mechanism that could cause a population to evolve to a point they are a new species.

Fairbanks also provides great insight into how science can methodically track back our current genome to its origins, even tracking into the DNA of common ancestral species by using the DNA available in modern day flora and fauna. Fairbanks describes how the DNA in all life provides the ""fossil"" evidence for our common ancestry along with the evidence needed to relate the closeness of our relationships and the rational inferences on when certain speciation events occurred. The fact this trail is independently confirmed by both the geologic record and the fossil record amply closes the door that ""intelligent design"" is at work, unless the designer was very unintelligent given the inefficiency of mostly extraneous material in DNA from a design perspective. The fact the actual fossil and geologic record are independently validated by this new evidence has firmly established the theory of evolution as one with overwhelming evidence with no imaginable alternative explanations. Don't believe it? Read this book and then reassess your position.

In terms of reading level, I think anyone who understands high school biology or can read at the college level will enjoy and learn from this book. You may not understand the properties and laws at play but the story will sufficiently emerge, be understood, and provide an enjoyable read. My one criticism of the book is that given Fairbanks provides no primer on molecular biology; the glossary's definitions should have been more expansive. I suggest reading the book near an on-line computer so you can look up the terms in a superior glossary.

There are several book formats available to the general reader to consider the strength of the theory of evolution. I've categorized a few while offering some recommendations that are very readable for the general reader. Other criteria considered was the integrity of the author and the fealty to reporting only peer-accepted work rather than creating arguments that lack peer-accepted evidence:

1) A general tutorial that exposes the reader to the physical evidence while also serving as either a tutorial or inferred case study on scientific methodology. These sorts of books often tie together the multitude of disciplines which have independently validated the evidence though also tending towards some bias in terms of focusing more on fossil evidence at the expense of DNA evidence - especially those published prior to several years ago. These books often ignore creationist arguments given those argument are not scientific. Carl Zimmer's Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Human Origins [SMITHSON INTIMATE GT HUMAN ORI] is an excellent example and worthy of any library especially given its photographs and illustrations. I have strong confidence that Zimmer's about to be released book The Tangled Bank: An Introduction to Evolution will also be a worthy edition to one's library given that I anticipate his new book will have far more DNA evidence than the Smithsonian book (he's stated as such in his blog).

2) A general tutorial similar to the above example while considering creationist arguments is Jerry Coyne's Why Evolution Is True. Its recent publication date allows Coyne to incorporate much of the more recent DNA evidence that corroborates the fossil evidence. Choices in this area and the former argue for new publications given the wealth of recent discoveries, especially in molecular and developmental biology as we continue to use new technologies to map and observe genomes of an increasing number of species, including our own. Coyne's selection of evidence is also biased towards evidence that falsifies any notions of a creator/designer, especially pseudogenes; genes that were once active in ancestors but have become inactivated.

3) A book that focuses primarily on the debate between science and creationism is Ken Miller's Only a Theory: Evolution and the Battle for America's Soul. Given Miller's status as a cell biologist who also teaches a introductory level biology course at Brown University, Miller is an excellent instructor that doesn't avoid molecular biology as much as previous general evolution books.

4) Profiles and memoirs of scientists engaged in evolution that also present evidence of evolution though focusing on a particular discovery or the personal experiences of the scientists themselves. These take on a more personal tone while often reporting on an aspect of the compelling evidence for evolution. Two masterpieces have been recently published, Neil Shubin's Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body (Vintage) and Sean B. Carroll's Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origin of Species. Shubin and Carroll present the romantic aspect of the journey and discovery that can make a scientific life so personal fulfilling while greatly advancing human knowledge. However, the amount of evidence, along with the breadth of these offerings' coverage is astonishing. I was most impressed and amazed at how broad a functional expert Shubin is, going well beyond the fame he's earned with his fieldwork right into the lab in terms of his discoveries in developmental biology.

5) A comprehensive review of a subset of the functions that contribute to our current set of findings and understanding. These made good follow-up books to the more general books like Coyne's aforementioned book. Examples in this category have authors focusing specifically on the fossil evidence, or the evidence in our DNA. Three books appear to have risen to the top in this area, all are very worthy reads. Fairbanks' offering reviewed here, Carroll's competing offering, The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution, and regarding the fossil and geologic evidence, Donald Prothero's Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters.",13
Randolph Eck,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,Incredible Evidence,"In the preface, Daniel Fairbanks mentioned that people often asked him to recommend a book that explained the molecular evidence for evolution. He couldn't recommend a book that covered the subject comprehensively. His solution: he wrote the book himself, and this is the book. I'm glad he decided to write it. This book shows the evidence of evolution in human DNA, and it is quite remarkable.

If I had any doubts of an evolutionary path of descent in the primate line, and were talking here about gibbons, old world monkeys, new world monkeys, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans, this book erased those doubts. Fairbanks discusses a variety of ways in which the genetic code shows evidence of evolution. To name a few, we have fusions, transposable elements (transposons, retroelements), pseudogenes (unitary, duplication, retropseudogene), fissions, deletions, and inversions. All of these are discussed at length and Fairbanks makes everything crystal clear with lucid explanations and excellent diagrams.

In chapter four, he discusses chloroplasts and mitochondria and their bacteriological origins. Chapter five delves into introns, exons and the topic of selectively neutral mutations. In chapter seven, the topic of genetic diversity is tackled. In chapter nine ""When Faith and Reason Clash,"" Fairbanks digresses into the controversial topic of creation-science and evolution.

The book concludes with three excellent appendixes. They elaborate in more detail some of the material discussed earlier in the book. Appendix 1 covers detailed information on the NANOG gene, and the comparison of this gene in humans, chimpanzees and the rhesus macaque. Appendix 2 dives into the nine inversions that distinguish human and chimpanzee chromosomes. Appendix 3 gives a brief history genomic science from Darwin, Mendel and Miescher to our present day - an interesting story.

It is impossible in a short review to make one appreciate the evidence presented in this book. I think you owe to yourself to read this book, and let the evidence speak for itself.",3
Gio,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,As Plain as the Nose on Your Face!,"Hey, that handsome nose on your face contains incontrovertible evidence aplenty of the FACT of evolution. Rhinoviruses evolve rapidly, incessantly, within a time frame that makes their evolution directly `observable' by humans. Next time you catch a cold, remember this: your own body contains such voluminous evidence of evolution that no supercomputer could process all of it. Scientist Daniel Fairbanks has selected a few tidbits of such evidence (yes, only a selection, but his choices are consistent with thousands of other bits he might have chosen) from his own field of knowledge and research, genetics. Specifically, he has reported discoveries of the Human Genome Project and of other comparative research into the structure and function of DNA, and he has focused chiefly on the comparison of human DNA with that of other primates, particularly chimpanzees. The first half of this book, Relics of Eden, explains current information about DNA -- incomplete knowledge, of course; all knowledge remains incomplete! -- with such elegant simplicity that any literate person can judge its reliability, even a person who couldn't tell a molecule of a protein from a crystal of quartz. Believe me, you don't need to understand the science to perceive the weight of the evidence! Even someone who can't sing a tune, play an instrument or read a note can respond emotionally and intelligently to a great piece of music. That's my analogy for the 'availability' of Professor Fairbanks's explanations. It's the generous simplicity of his explanations that earns my FIVE STAR rating of his book.

Let me say it again: evolution is a FACT. What Charles Darwin called ""descent with modification"" doesn't depend on fossils; it's been evident to clever people since the first farmers selected seeds and the first animal husbandmen bred sheep. Darwin drew heavily on examples from pigeon and dog breeding to illustrate ""descent with modification"". Darwin's leap from indisputable observed FACT to ""theory"" was his intuition that ""descent with modification"" over a sufficiently long period of time - deep time - could have been the process by which all life forms, including Humans, descended from a simple (single) ancestral organism. The recognition of 'deep time', of the vast antiquity of the planet, was already available in Darwin's lifetime, prominently in the works of the geologist Charles Lyell. Darwin theorized that the evolution of species was driven by two pressures: reproductive competition and successful adaptation to environmental constraints. But Darwin's speculations were merely the 'midge on the beak of the seagull sitting on the tip of the iceberg'. Current 'neo-Darwinian' theories of evolution represent the consensus of many thousands of scientists in diverse fields, not merely paleontology but also geology, biology, biochemistry, genetics, medicine, astrophysics, climatology, etc. I strongly suspect that even baseball statisticians are part of this consensus. I know that bassoonists are.

Fairbanks introduces the second half of his text with a quote from the great geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky, from an article of 1973: ""Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution."" That sentence does sum up matters rather elegantly, but it could be extended: nothing in any earth science makes sense except in the light of evolution. Nothing in human healtha and health care makes sense except in the light of evolution. Nothing in human psychology makes sense except in the light of evolution. ""Evolution"" is at the heart of the paradigm of contemporary understanding of everything.

However, the second half of ""Relics of Eden"" (excluding two appendices aimed at scientifically better-prepared readers, covering the same topics as the earlier chapters), Fairbanks departs from his `educational' agenda in order to address what he calls the ""dichotomy"" between religion and science -- ""when Faith and Reason clash"" -- which he deplores. A central argument, a familiar one, is that Science and Religion are separate spheres of insight; modern science, he says, can no more disprove the existence of ""God"" than pre-modern science could prove it. In fact, Science doesn't address that question, since it has no proper methodology for asking it. Thus those who believe in a transcendent power - a spiritual realm, a supernature - have no need to fear that their beliefs are incompatible with Science. Religion and Science can coexist, says Fairbanks, as shown by the fact that not all committed evolutionary scientists are atheists.

Now Prof. Fairbanks and this reader must part company. Oh, I'm willing enough to accept the platitude that Science and Religion are separate spheres of perception, and therefore not intrinsically incompatible. But frankly I find that conclusion utterly disingenuous and shallow. The sort of ""God"" being salvaged by this sophistry isn't the ""God"" in whom `WE' trust. Fairbanks exposes his own naivete by quoting a passage from Phillip Johnson, a prominent founder of the `Intelligent Design' movement:
""""The story of salvation by the cross makes no sense against a background of evolutionary naturalism. The evolutionary story is a story of humanity's climb from animal beginnings to rationality, not a story of a fall from perfection.... It is a story about learning to rely entirely on human intelligence, not a story of the helplessness of that intelligence in the face of the inescapable fact of sin."""" Whoa, Trigger! Despite Mr. Johnson's profound misstatement of the theory of evolution, which is NOT all about human progress to rationality (Ha!), he is absolutely correct in declaring that the fundamental Christian doctrines of original sin, Christ's sacrifice and resurrection, redemption, forgiveness, and a Last Judgment are all incompatible with Evolution, and not only Evolution but also astronomy, astrophysics, history, and anthropology. In other words, most ""fundamentalists' -- Christian, Muslim, and Jewish -- are correct: Science is incompatible with THEIR religions! Rather few of them would be comforted by the notion that Science is ready to tolerate a diffuse belief of some wispy, unprovable Spiritual Entity, if only they are willing to abandon their Faith in a Merciful Father, a Personal Saviour, an eschatological comprehension of all history and the universe, and a Life After Death complete with rewards and eternal punishment.

Fairbanks also proposes that the fervid efforts to obstruct scientific education in America, and to `disinform' the general population about science in general and evolutionary science in particular, are political in origin and are supported by a small number of misguided ideologues. I have a feeling that he doesn't spend much time delving in the `roots' of American conservatism; he certainly hasn't discussed `religion and science' with my aunts and cousins in rural Minnesota.

But then, Fairbanks does a brilliant job of demolishing the idiotic arguments against Evolution, on the grounds of ""irreducible complexity"", of Michael Behe, and that's fun! That's worth the price of the book and the time needed to read it.",3
David T.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,The DNA Evidence,"I've been on an evolution book kick lately, but out of the three books I've read so far none have addressed my biggest question. If we share a common ancestor with apes why do we have 23 chromosomes while all other apes have 24. Knowing this is a huge issue Fairbanks addresses the fusion of two ape chromosomes into one right away in the first chapter. This book goes into detail on DNA evidence for evolution, I can kind of see why its not as often mentioned in the other books, its a little harder to understand and isn't quite as interesting or obvious as something like the fossil record. In any case though the evidence is also there and this makes a great companion book to another introduction to evolution. Also expect a couple of chapters on Religion and Evolution (the author is a Mormon), it has a similar feel as Finding Darwin's God (but not as in depth). On an interesting side note Whales share 96% of their DNA with Hippos which makes you appreciate just how much change can happen in minor differences.",3
N. D. Schey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,Evidence of Evolution via Genetics,"'Relics of Eden' presents a very nice summary of how current investigations in molecular biology are providing evidence for evolution. With the advent of the modern synthesis, the incorporation of genetics with Darwinian evolution, the theory of evolution is gaining additional support. Much of this new evidence comes from what Daniel Fairbanks refers to as the relics of Eden, the pseudogenes or that part of our DNA not currently being used for coding purposes. A short history describing the development of the modern synthesis is included as an appendix. Today, genetics is the major player in evolution and this book explains how this work is proceeding.

The book focuses on human evolution and the similarities and differences in our genes compared to those of chimpanzees. Not only the similarity in genes between closely, or even distantly, related species, but their differences show how modern species developed and how they are related. Although we have more than 98 percent of our DNA in common with chimpanzees, the differences are also important in showing the link and in making us who we are.

This book is a good companion book to Donald Prothero's `Evolution', which describes biological diversity in terms of the fossil record. `Relics of Eden' is well written, easy for the lay person to read and is recommended for the beginner interested in learning how we got here. A well-chosen glossary at the back of the book provides a quick reference to the definition of common terms used in the book, something I would like to see in other scientific books aimed at the lay person.",13
Sam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,Reader-Friendly,"This is a quick read. It's very interesting to anyone who is interested in this area of science, and it's so reader friendly that even after many years since studying this subject, I still understood what the author was talking about. He explains it all in a simple way that still encompasses the fascinating conclusions drawn from these techniques, but he doesn't simplify so much that it feels like condescension. It's a great pick-up-and-read.",1
Adam D. Shomsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,Excellent companion to Why Evolution is True,"Relics of Eden is a great companion to Jerry Coyne's Why Evolution is True. Whereas Jerry Coyne sampled evidence from many different disciplines and didn't dig very deep into the DNA evidence, Fairbanks fills in the blanks with a book-length summary of the evidence in understandable terms for the uninitiated. This book gets into more technical details of DNA than other books on evolution I have read, but that makes sense because I've never read a book whose topic is exclusively DNA. But Fairbanks always defines his terms and explains them to the reader - often with helpful diagrams - so that you can get a handle on the meaning even if you know nothing about DNA.

The remainder of this review constitutes a summary of selected pieces of the book:

The vast majority of DNA is mostly functionless; it doesn't code proteins and doesn't have any direct effect on embryology. But within this wasteland is a world of information, such as remnants of mutated genes that no longer function. For instance, the GULO gene allows other animals to make vitamin C, but humans and primates have a mutated version of the gene that no longer functions (called a pseudogene). Presumably, our ancient ancestors consumed plenty of vitamin C and had little need for this gene - so when an offspring was born with a mutated (and disabled) GULO gene, there was no decrease in fitness, allowing the mutated gene to be passed on to future generations. It was ""selectively neutral."" Any further mutations to the gene were also selectively neutral - they had no impact on the fitness of the individual carrying the mutation. Regardless of why we ended up with a mutated GULO gene, Fairbanks writes ""the fragment that's left is loaded with mutations; about 20 percent of the DNA sequence is mutated."" ""Although this pseudogene is highly mutated and utterly useless, humans and chimpanzees have almost identical copies of it. The chimpanzee genome contains the same GULO pseudogene, in the same place in the DNA, and the chimpanzee and human versions are 98 percent identical. The same can be said for almost every other pseudogene in the human genome. With a few notable exceptions, chimpanzees and humans have the same pseudogenes in the same places, and they are, on average, about 98 percent similar.""

So even though humans cannot make vitamin C, our ancestors once could, and there is a trace of this ancient capacity left in our DNA. The human genome actually contains more pseudogenes - about 20,000 - than real genes, providing volumes of information about our evolutionary past. As Fairbanks noted above, the fact that chimpanzees share the vast majority of our nonfunctional pseudogenes, including almost all of the same mutations to them, speaks volumes about our common ancestry. Why would an intelligent designer put thousands of useless, mutated versions of genes in our DNA, then put almost identical copies in chimpanzee DNA, and slightly less similar copies in gorillas, and slightly less similar copies in orangutans, etc?

A retrovirus, such as the AIDS virus and the flu, makes a copy of its genetic code and inserts it into the host's DNA. In rare cases, ""a retrovirus inserted itself into the DNA of an immature reproductive cell that gave rise to sperm or egg cells."" The virus is now part of the offspring's DNA and can be copied to any future progeny. When a retrovirus becomes mutated and cannot infect new cells, it is called a retroelement. ""Retroelements make up a whopping 42.8 percent of the human genome."" There are millions of copies of retroelements in human DNA, relics of ancient infections. How ancient? ""In case after case, transposable elements [a retroelement is one kind of transposable element] in human DNA were present at exactly the same positions in chimpanzee DNA, and to a lesser degree in other apes and monkeys."" The obvious explanation is that the infections occurred in the common ancestors of those species who share them. Why would an intelligent designer scatter millions of virus-like retroelements throughout our DNA and put nearly identical copies in chimp DNA, in all the same locations? And why is the degree of similarity of retroelements in different species related to the degree of similarity in pseudogenes, the degree of physiological similarity of the species, and the fossil record?

Of course the hypothetical designer could have inscrutable motives that we could never understand, but the patterns observed in DNA fit perfectly with a wealth of other independent evidence (outside the scope of this book) such as the fossil record, comparative anatomy, vestigial organs, comparative embryology, etc, etc. All the evidence points to one obvious conclusion, one simple explanation: common descent with modification. To quote Jerry Coyne ""if a designer did have discernible motives when creating species, one of them must surely have been to fool biologists by making organisms look as though they evolved.""

Chapters 9 and 10, entitled ""when faith and reason clash"" and ""abandoning the dichotomy"" are aimed at reconciling the overwhelming evidence of common descent with religious faith. Fairbanks writes ""I hold deep religious convictions,"" but it seems that he has kept his religious convictions separate from his scientific work. In any case where his religion makes falsifiable empirical claims and those claims have been falsified beyond a reasonable doubt, he seems to have chosen reason over faith, relegating faith to those matters which are unfalsifiable. If one insists upon faith in anything, this is the most reasonable position in my opinion. However, if those falsifiable claims made by your religion have been falsified, then what does that tell you about the reliability of the unfalsifiable ones? I, for one, am not inspired with confidence. But these chapters are rather aside from the main thrust of the book, which is no worse off for the author's religious convictions.",8
The Spinozanator,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,There's No Controversy,"I've been expecting a book on this subject and Fairbanks does a superb job.

Tracking fossil evidence in DNA means following the histories of mutations in non-coding DNA segments. There are several different kinds of mutations - some of them more unique than a birthmark. When mutations occur in active coding genes (>2% of the genome), an impaired embryo usually results and neither the new life-form nor the new mutation survives. The mutations that occur in most non-coding segments of DNA have no effect on the embryo, so the life-form is normal, and any mutations accumulate harmlessly in that life-form and its descendants. The earlier on the ""tree of life"" the mutation occurs, the more species will carry it. Our DNA is full of these gene-prints left by our ancestors.

Here's the simple version of how it works: Orangutans, gorillas, chimps, and humans all had a common ancestor. Then orangutans forked off, leaving gorillas, chimps and humans. Then gorillas forked off, leaving chimps and humans. If a mutation is not in gorillas, chimps, or humans but is in orangutans; you know the mutation happened after orangutans forked off from the common ancestor to all four. If a given mutation is in gorillas but not in the chimps, you can expect it won't be in humans, either.

With a boost from the human genome project, hundreds of species' genomes have been published in the last few years. Studying DNA sequences in species thought to be closely related shows exactly when one species branched off in relation to the other. Since you can use this method for all living things, including living species that haven't changed in 400 million years, molecular biologists are having a field day. A few species have been relocated but by and large, the tree of life painstakingly put together from fossil and geological evidence by paleontologists has been confirmed.

If you just want one good example of how to use DNA ""fossil"" evidence, read chapter one. Fairbanks explains with words and pictures how the 24 chromosomes of the chimp became 23 chromosomes in the human. Briefly, chimp chromosome two and three fused. The very specific chromosomal and molecular details as to what happened are there for you. Importantly, data like that is only the tip of the iceberg. With such incontrovertible documentation throughout the tree of life as recorded in DNA, I have to ask myself how any reasonable person who honestly studies this subject could doubt evolution.

In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences issued this statement, written before common usage of genome comparison: ""It is no longer possible to sustain scientifically the view that living things did not evolve from earlier forms or that the human species was not produced by the same evolutionary mechanisms that apply to the rest of the living world."" Now large scale experiments based on DNA analysis have spectacularly confirmed what we already knew.

Fairbanks doesn't overwhelm the reader with details of molecular biology, but those without a bit of an appropriate background might have their hands full. Even so, technical parts can be skipped without missing the point. Anyone thinking there's a controversy about evolution should read this book. As Theodosius Dobzhansky said, ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.""

Benaiah Edwards,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,Easier to read than you think,"This book is very easy to read. When I started it, I thought all the talk about DNA and such would be hard for someone to grasp without background knowledge in the field. But it turns out Fairbanks does an excellent job of getting right to his point, showing the overwhelming evidence of evolutionary history to be found in DNA. He goes on to address the dichotomy presented by those who discount evolution. Kenneth Miller put it best in his book, Finding Darwin's God: ""In order to defend God against the challenge from evolution, they [the creationists] have had to make him into a schemer...[who] has negated science by rigging the universe with fiction and deception. To embrace that God we must reject science and worship deception itself.""",5
Mike Blyth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,Just a note on the Kindle version,"I agree with the numerous positive reviews already found here. I have studied a little genetics and molecular biology, but that was nearly 30 years ago, so I wanted an update on what has been learned and especially how it applies to evolution. I was quite pleased with the presentation, only wishing that it had been even longer. If you read the book, do not neglect the quite readable appendices.

As far as the Kindle version in particular, it is very good (a very few of the usual problems such as broken words) but the detailed diagrams are difficult to make out even when zoomed. The salient points of the diagrams are explained in the text anyway, so it should not be a significant barrier if you want to get the Kindle version, but if it's a toss-up, you may want the hard copy.",3
99th BG,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,You must read this book,"This book and the work it represents should end the debate about common descent. The evidence of common descent is clearly shown in your chromosomes. No interpretation of fossils or other subjective or expert-dependent analysis is necessary.

You can argue about Darwin and evolution all you want to, but any one with a reasonable mind and who knows what is in our chromosomes cannot deny that the tree of life exists.

The book is well written and technically accurate.
A pleasure to read.",4
D Boy Flex,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,"Simple, consice, amazin",I took a class from the author and came across this book a few years after and was immediately taken to it.

I would recommend this book to anybody looking for a book about evidence of evolution in our DNA. Great read.,9
Maria Isabel Albert,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA,Understanding DNA and relation to evolution,This is the best book I have read. It really explains the relationship of the human DNA with our ancestors and other life forms on earth. Fairbanks easily explains the DNA and answers so many questions like how do they know we originated in Africa? How are we related to chimpanzees? It is an amazing book and very well written.

Rodrigo Savage,4.0 out of 5 stars,Algorithms in Bioinformatics: A Practical Introduction (Chapman & Hall/CRC Mathematical and Computational Biology),"The book is new, just arrive one month later","the book is very nice and good, it just arrive one month after I order it,
but it was international shipping, it's understandable
the book starts with molecular biology background and then explains the importance of the algorithms, and how to implement them",2
"Eric ""Siggy"" Scott",5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Bioinformatics,"Excellent introduction, but a bit light","Lesk's introduction is an excellent guide for the newcomer to the world of large-scale genomic data. It is my opinion that you can end your search here for an entry point to the modern field of bioinformatics. It's organized around tools of the trade rather than grandiose theory (systems biology discussions left off till the last chapter), and will serve better as a introduction for undergraduates or researchers new to the field than a reference book for experts. It's biggest perk is the lucidness of discussion and readability.

As best I can tell, the target audience is undergraduate biology students who have basic familiarity with computer programming. Virtually no mathematical sophistication is required -- there is not a proof in sight, and complex mathematical topics like Hidden Markov Models and Monte Carlo algorithms are explained in an unintimidating, intuitive manner. Computer science knowledge such as graph theory, dynamic programming, and computational complexity are introduced minimally and only when they are needed.

Biological concepts are also sufficiently explained, except for perhaps a term here and there, and as a computer scientist I found the book a cinch to read.

Lesk's writing style is lucid and motivated. You know not only what you're learning, but why you're learning it and what you can do with it. Therefore, the book is self-contained and is excellent for self-study.

The first half of the book (Chapter 1-4) are a high-level overview, and a practical summary of existing databases of genetic and proteomic data. This serves an excellent guide for those who A) need to become familiar with the websites that ""everybody"" in the field knows about, or B) are eager to get their paws on sequence data and start playing! Chapter 3 even gives a (very) brief introduction to data mining and natural language processing for extracting information from the literature.

Chapters 5-7 are the meat of the matter. Sequence alignment (chapter 5) is ""THE basic tool of bioinformatics"" (p. 243), and is what much of the technical material is organized around. Dotplots, single and multiple sequence alignment, profiling, BLAST, PSI-BLAST, Hidden Markov Models, and phylogenetic trees are all discussed and situated so that the read knows the advantages and disadvantages of each tool, and their limitations used to motivated future chapters on protein structure.

Chapter 6 covers protein folding, structure prediction, classification, and function prediction, as well as applications to drug discovery.

Chapter 7 ends the book with a more theoretical, big-picture discussion of systems biology, information theory, and regulatory networks.

Overall, I think this book is great. It will give you a solid, if low-resolution understanding of the field, and the writing style ensures that you have a genuine understanding of the tools' relationship to scientific questions. The book is full of practical tips like ""Visual examination of multiple sequence alignment tables is one of the most profitable activities that a molecular biologist can undertake away from the lab bench. Don't even THINK about not displaying them with different colors for amino acids of different physiochemical type"" (p. 271). He also is careful to emphasize difficulties in, for instance, inferring homology from sequence similarity, and in making assumptions about mutation rate. And if you are a biologist who doesn't need more than a basic understanding of the most effective tools, maybe this is sufficient.

Perhaps best of all, you can actually *read* a book like this from cover to cover! And you will actually *remember* what you read!

That said, as a computer scientist with a math degree under my belt, I did miss the presence of rigorous mathematics. The academic field of bioinformatics is much more technical than this introduction-for-mathophobes would imply, as other books like Waterman's (now outdated) Introduction to Computational Biology: Maps, Sequences and Genomes (Chapman & Hall/CRC Interdisciplinary Statistics) makes painfully clear. Then again, that's probably why I didn't ever finish reading Waterman!

That said, I should point out that I was never bored with Lesk's description of algorithms.",12
John Faughnan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Principles of Health Interoperability HL7 and SNOMED (Health Informatics),A good introduction to a very tough subject,"This is a revised review. I reviewed this book shortly after it came out and give it four stars. That was, however, a bit of a grumpy review. Since then I've made this book the mainstay of the health informatics lectures I do for the U of Minnesota. I would now give it four stars without reservation. In this domain there's no rival to this text.

Overall it is a book aimed at an informatics student, written in a telegraphic style that is a good fit for a rather dry but terribly important topic. Only a portion of the book is about HL7 and SNOMED however. Of the 225 pages I found

- 74 on modeling and markup topics better addressed in other books
- 12 pages on SDOs
- 81 pages on HL7 and CDA/CCR/CCD
- 26 on SNOMED
- 8 pages on using HL7 and SNOMED together

Although I would prefer much less coverage of modeling and markup and more on HL7/SNOMED integration, there's still more than enough material to occupy a typical first class in health informatics. This is a better book for my purposes that the informatics textbooks I've used to date.

I hope there will be a 2nd edition. I know I'd buy it!",22
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Principles of Health Interoperability HL7 and SNOMED (Health Informatics),Required Reading For Anyone Involved in Health IT,"Health Interoperability is a very timely topic in the USA in large part because of the HITECH act and the huge amount of tax dollars that are going for Electronic Health Records and Information exchanges. Interoperability is impossible without sophisticated standards for both a grammar and vocabulary for health care that can be semantically interpreted by machines. HL7 V3 RIM is the grammar, and SNOMED-CT is the vocabulary that are needed accomplish the goal of semantic interoperability.

Before this book, a newcomer would have to read thousands of pages of white papers from HL7, IHE, and IHTSDO (International Standards Development Organizations), and attend meetings for years before seeing how these non trivial standards work together.

I'm involved in projects at Kaiser Permanente that rely on SNOMED-CT and HL7. Most of our project managers, or even physician leaders in the organization are not experts in UML, XML, HL7, CDA, or SNOMED. They do not have the opportunity to spend hours reading separate books, attending tutorials or otherwise obtaining the knowledge in this book in an efficient way.

Of course if you really want to know UML, or XML or any of these subjects in great depth, there are ""better books"" available. But this is the only book that put's it all together. I find it an advantage that it is under 300 pages. An interested person can read this book in just a few days, and will then know what otherwise would have been an epic effort to learn. I have given separate talks on many of these subjects, but in any single talk you could not hope to cover all of the material in this book.

End User,5.0 out of 5 stars,Principles of Health Interoperability HL7 and SNOMED (Health Informatics),Great book!,"Does a great job of easing into the details of why EHR is such a big deal, and how HL7 and SNOMED play an integral part in a successful EHR strategy. Honestly, I thought this book was going to be torturously dry and boring, but I actually enjoyed the read.

As an aside, I had this book on my desk today at work, and one of the ladies picked it up, read the back cover, told me I must be really smart, smiled, and turned and swished away. If I end up getting lucky because of this book, I'll be sure to come back and post an update.",2

Very well written and clear in the explanations, it is obvious how knowledgeable that Mr. Benson is in the topics covered. The only ""complaints"" at all that I have regarding this book are these:
1) The paperback cover is not very durable and does not hold up well for such a heavily used reference (I preferred the prior version's hardback cover)
2) Many more pages should be dedicated to this book, to give the proper expanded coverage the topics deserve.

Raymond Simkus,5.0 out of 5 stars,Principles of Health Interoperability HL7 and SNOMED (Health Informatics),Basis for interoperability of healthcare records,This is an excellent book that provides some interesting historical details and the reasons that make interoperability important. There are some interesting and perhaps tongue in cheek comments on ways that health care has not taken up some technology that was developed 500 years ago. Terminology and information exchange are parts of the foundation that needs to be in place before there can be meaningful use of computerized patient records. This book provides a nice introduction to these topics.,2
Elliot Kleiman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Blast,Very Practical & Useful Users Guide,"From a users-perspective this book serves its purpose well - it explains what it is that BLAST is doing ""under-the-hood"" so that one may better customize Blast's search behavior. All I know is that I really learned a lot of basic fundamental core concepts here that I previously just took for granted.

The book discusses the biology, statistics, algorithms, and computer science issues involved in explaining blast. I liked this approach because it does not head super far into any one core area but rather sticks to a strong fundamental overview of each topic. The other strong aspect of this book is that the author thoroughly compares NCBI and WU Blast throughout, characterizing instances where one may choose one over the other and/or how to tweak the parameters for both in those situations.

I orginally bought the book b/c I wanted an overview on PAM and BLOSUM matrices and to understand how Blast Statistics work. It really served as an informative contextual tutorial that has definitely raised my overall understanding on not only Blast, but to better grasp the very interdisciplinary nature concerning sequence alignment for in-silico biological research.",2
KD,3.0 out of 5 stars,Essential Bioinformatics,Very simple,I used this book for a bioinformatics class and I also worked as a biotechnology programmer for around 8 years. It is a simple well written introduction to some topics in bioinformatics. But it not high level enough to use a reference for my work; but a introduction is probably what the author intended.,1
Megarat,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bioinformatics for Vaccinology,"Weird and not exactly cohesive, but I like it","I work in this very field (bioinformatics and vaccinology), so I expect that I am right in the middle of this book's target audience. My impressions overall have been mixed, and I regard it as half-baked, but at the end of the day I think this book is very useful. The copy I had read came from a colleague, but I like it enough that I bought a copy for myself.

This book is all over the place in ways that are good (even great) and bad. My initial reaction to this book was surprise: the first 50 pages was about the history of vaccination, followed by another 20 pages about the contemporary use of vaccines. So right there, 25% of the book is a historical and contemporary background -- a perspective neither technical nor heavily biological, as the title would otherwise imply.

At this point -- even though I was enjoying the material -- I felt that the title was misleading. And yet it still took another 40 pages of immunological background before Flower really kicks into the meat of the text. Here, however, is where the book turns into a terrific overview. I learned heaps -- about databases and analytical methods that I didn't even know existed. I was able to apply topics from the book immediately into my work, and I'm sure I'll reference it again in the future. It's like a terrific survey course. It won't teach you how to program, or model databases, or analyze data, or how to use any of the tools/methods that are discussed, but it gives you a nice scenic tour of all the important landmarks you should know about.

I mentioned that my reaction was mixed, and indeed this book has some downsides worth mentioning. The largest is that the author never properly settled on who the audience should be. It seems to me that the book is mostly geared toward graduate students or professional practitioners in molecular biology who want to learn about how developments in bioinformatics can expand their research horizons. (I.e., those people who are heavy on the bio-, light on the -informatics.) This is because the book itself is technically light. Still, the book features a bizarre, inconsistent mix of pedagogical background and assumed knowledge.

I mentioned previously that there are 40 pages of background about how vaccines and the immune system works, written at a good depth for the biologically-naive. Yet much of the successive content is seriously biobabble-rich, perfectly suited for any molbio Ph.D. candidate. For example (to pick a sentence at random): ""The molecule may exist as a canonical ensemble of tautomers, thus necessitating the the explicit construction of all tautomeric forms."" If you don't know what tautomers are, or why this statement might be important, don't look for an explanation in this book. And this was a frequent occurrence with me: I would come across some content that was out of my biological depth, then glaze over it and move on. This happened at least once per page, and on a few occasions entire pages-long sections were skipped.

(From the other perspective, there are methods and tools described in the text that strict biologists would probably regard as out of their depth if they were to try to implement them, although I suspect that they would find the descriptions easier reading, as this book wasn't as infused with technobabble or mathbabble.)

And here's a personal gripe: some references aren't fully cited, which is a shame for an overview like this. For example, the table of z-scales on page 195 only covers 18 of the 20 biogenic amino acids, so I tried to find the table via the original source. The text only references ""Svante Wold and coworkers"" and doesn't cite an actual paper. And unfortunately, due to the long and many-storied history of Wold's z-scales, it took a while for me to track down the specific paper that contained the most-recent version of the table. So I find it ironic: the purpose of the book is to provide a sampler of methods and tools to use in the field of computational vaccinology, but here I was, trying to implement one of the described methods, and there was a surprisingly large barrier in accomplishing it due to an inadequate amount of information.

All of this leaves me with the impression that this book is half-baked, and I believe the root cause of this is that much of the book's material was (I accidentally discovered) literally duplicated (as in, copy-and-paste) from some of Flowers' scientific papers. Talk about saving time ... literally, there are pages-long passages that can be matched, word-for-word, with some of his publication history. No (or little) massaging was done to make it cohesive with the rest of the book, and voila, you end up with this curious pastiche of scientific topics. This book would make more sense if it were set up as a collection of previously published papers, but then it would also be difficult to justify its $90 price tag.

Still, in spite of its weaknesses, I like this book a lot, for what it is: a broad overview for people who are already fairly entrenched in the field. You'll probably find the information more consistently enriching if you have at least some graduate-level exposure to biology, although if you work more on the computational side, just snooze through the biobabble and you should find some great nuggets in this book as well.",1

wiredweird,5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics (Statistics for Biology and Health),Great all-around review of probability,"The book's title says 'Statistical Methods', but all of statistics is derived from probability theory. That's really where Ewens and Grant start, with the best high-density review of probability I know.

The first two chapters cover probabilities of one and many variables, respectively. This includes several topics that other authors equently skip, including conditional and marginal probabilities, probability- and moment-generating functions, a little about entropy, distributions of sums, and extreme value statistics. All that takes about 100 pages. Two later chapters cover statistical inference (parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian techniques), two more cover stochastic processes including Markov models, a short chapter includes hidden Markov models and their training, and another chapter covers sampling techniques: bootstraps, permutation tests and such.

If the book contained only that material, it would still be a valuable review and summary of basic probability. It's way too dense to be a beginner's text. That's OK, those chapters were really intended as a review and as a statement of the terms and notation used in the book's real objectives: models of biological systems.

The chapters on biological applications are interspersed with chapters on basics, so that each application is presented as soon as its elements are covered. Those chapters describe statistical properties of a single DNA or protein string, relationships between two strings, BLAST and its scoring models, mutation modeling, and construction of phylogenetic trees. Coverage of each topic is brief but very dense. A surprising amount of information is packed into each brief chapter, and it's surprisingly readable. Still, these are big topics. Ewens and Grant don't and don't try to present any topic to its full depth. Instead, they give enough discussion that a determined reader can learn the basics, and can understand more advanced discussions of specific topics.

The book does require a determined reader with some background in probability - this shouldn't be anyone's first book, unless you have a very skilled teacher. The prepared and careful reader will be very well rewarded, however. Despite the book's title about statistics and bioinformatics, this is a reference you may use for probability models in any field. It's certainly one that I keep coming back to.

DoctorAndy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics (Statistics for Biology and Health),Disappointing overview,"This book is a tremendous disappointment, given other Amazon reviews and the impressive Table of Contents. I picked several topics about which I know something: Likelihoods, P-values, bootstraps. I would have had NO idea about either of these subjects based on the poor delivery in this book. Topics are not well introduced, there are virtually no examples, and the introduction/discussion of most topics is wordy and not informative.
A topic such as the two-sample t-statistic is scattered throughout the book, with the main part not even cited in the index!
Unfortunately there are not a lot of books in the field of Statistics in Bioinformatics. However, I would recommend ""The Elements of Statistical Learning"" (Hastie et al.) for classifiers etc (Duda and Hart's classic is also good). I would recommend ""Biostatistical Analysis"" by Zar for a general coverage, and Terry Speed's ""stat Labs: Mathematical Statistics ..."" which is not comprehensive but has good lab examples with associated statistical analysis.",17
aloctavodia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Python For Bioinformatics (Series in Biomedical Informatics),Python for FUTURE bioinformatics,"The Author assumes a minimal background in bioinformatics, at least you must know what the field is about, a little of biology and have some ideas of programming (even better if you know Python). You only need to know little high school calculus and some algebra.

The idea of the book is to teach algorithms that are useful for real bioinformatic applications, with the hope that you will be creating you own algorithms or applications in the future. Is not a book to learn BioPython (the preface clearly states that and explains why the skills learned in this book an BioPython could be used in a complementary fashion).

The book uses Python 2, not Python 3. This is not a drawback as some people want to think, Python 2 is going to be the ""standard"" python for at least few year more and many (but not all) of the features of Python 3 are already present in Python 2.7. Even more important the book relies heavily in the NumPy library (as almost all scientific python programming) and NumPy is not, yet, compatible with Python 3, hence using Python 3 in a book like this will be, at least, non-sense.

The only problem is that sometimes with some topics the author does not take too much time to explain the applications of some ideas, for example in the chapter on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) the Author just explain how to program different HMM implementations. Probably this is a mismatch between my background and the author's (I am closer to the a structural-biologist/biophysics) and some concepts are not used in the exactly same way in different scientific branchs, nothing that not can be solved by reading a Wikipedia entry.

You should buy this book if you want to learn to develop bioinformatics solutions.",2
Keith P.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Python For Bioinformatics (Series in Biomedical Informatics),Could be better,"To be honest, I bought this book before I realized that what was out there for bioinformatics. I started a new job, and I knew Python, but I didn't know much about bioinformatics. I was a little disappointed that this book merely references biopython, and doesn't utilize it or show people how to use it. Why not use the tools that are available? In a classroom setting, I guess I can understand why you would want students to learn from the ground up, but this book is essentially teaching people Python in a bioinformatics way. For example, why does the book show how to parse fasta files in Chapter 6. This is merely a lesson in file parsing - something you should know if you understand Python, and why show it if biopython already does this for you.

If you don't know much about Python or Bioinformatics, then this book is probably for you. If you have previous Python experience, I would skip this book.",12

The best thing to me is that it tells each story from a theoretical way, but not a superficial way. It really helps you understand these machine learning methods from a deep perspective. Reading this book did let me think more thoroughly.
Of course the good thing can be a bad thing in that, if you do not have enough background in statistics and math, this book can be very difficult to read. The famous Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman's book is a good one and someone may complain that that book is not easy to read unless you have solid background in math. However Clarke's book, to me, is even harder.
If you really want to learn the details in data mining, this book would be an ideal resource.",11
wiredweird,2.0 out of 5 stars,Microarray Bioinformatics,Microarrays Lite,"It just doesn't have the detail I wanted.
There's a lot to like here. Stekel covers everything, starting with selecting the probes and printing the arrays. Next comes raw array analysis - scanning, image processing, and measuring the effects of the array itself on the results. That covers the first six chapters. The next three go over analysis of the result, one more chapter covers experimential design, and the last chapter discusses storing, labelling, and sharing the data. Some of those topics, like experiment design, address issues that most other authors neglect.
Still, I came away feeling that I had read only half of each chapter. Going back, it turned out that I hadn't missed anything that really was there. I missed a lot, though. For example, probe selection includes a discussion of self-hybridization - good stuff. It stopped short of giving me any clear idea how much self-complementarity is too much. It mentioned DNA melting points, but without enough information for me to understand what is really melting, or how or why to choose one melting point over another. Handling of raw array data discussed Loess regression as a way to cancel out process differences across a single array. Again, it's good stuff, but what exactly is a Loess regression? Expression analysis mentions Spearman correlation as an alternative to Pearson correlation - it give Pearson's formulas, but not Spearman's. Later, when the author does give a ""formula"" for selecting sample sizes, it turns out to be some macro reference for some stat package. Throughout the book, I felt the same lack: I learned the names of many things, but not what they really are.
Maybe this book is OK for a first introduction. If you've had that introduction and want to take the second steps, this book probably won't meet your needs.",13

B. Mayes,4.0 out of 5 stars,Computational Genome Analysis: An Introduction (Statistics for Biology & Health S),"Very nice book, but not really for beginners","This textbook is used as the main text for one of my graduate courses. It is a well written book and contains a plethora of information. The problem is that I find myself constantly re-reading sections and walking through examples to thoroughly understand them. Nothing seems to click the first time I read through the information (or sometimes even second, third, etc.).

This is my first time taking any coursework in the bioinformatics field so perhaps it is simply because this material is new to me, but I found this book fairly difficult to read. I had to supplement it with other books, wikipedia entries, etc. to be able to understand many of the terms (which this book fails to define).

If you're willing to put forth the effort of filling in the gaps, then this is a great book. If you already have a strong background in computer science and biology then this is likely an excellent book for reference material, or to expand you knowledge in an already familiar area.

Also note that there is a large amount of discussion of probability in this area of study. You may wish to brush up on your skills in probability prior to reading this.",6

However, if you already have a BS in biology or related field you might be better off looking for something more advanced.",5
wiredweird,5.0 out of 5 stars,Immunological Bioinformatics (Computational Molecular Biology),Bioinformatics at work,"The huge majority of bioinformatics (BI) books seem to treat the topic as an end in itself. I have to admit, there is a lot to enjoy in the algorithms people have developed and in clever implementations. Often, though, the calculations appear to be fine art, to enjoy in abstract, or for creating point solutions to isolated problems.

This book breaks the mold. It addresses every aspect of immunology, using BI as the tool and as the unifying language for discussing immunology's many aspects. The content gets off to a slow start, starting with two chapters describing the topic and its importance. The next three chapters summarize a few of the basic algorithms: alignment and multiple alignment, motif-finding, Gibbs sampling, clustering, and neural networks. The discussion is competent, and the authors' handling of neural nets stands out from the crowd of BI books. Still, the pace is too brisk and the range of topics is too narrow to recommend this book as a general BI text.

It's not one, and never meant to be. That section just reminds the knowledgable reader of the mathematical tools and BI terms to be used in the remaining nine chapters. Here's where an immunology background will help a lot. I know, because I lack one. Still, the discussion holds to a level that a determined reader with a general bio and BI background can follow. Even at my barely-following level, it's exciting stuff.

At this writing, the 2005 H5N1 bird flu is all over the front pages, so medical response to emerging viruses is on people's minds. This book explores the whole range of issues in immunological response to the threat: identifying specific viral features that stand out as vaccine targets, understanding the immunological mechanisms that need to be engaged, evolution of the pathogens to emerging human resistance, and the ways that human variation affects the decisions in medicine and public policy.

That last surprised me, but makes perfect sense. Different human populations have slightly different sets of alleles for immunological response. It's one of the reasons that humanity does so well in a world of ever-changing antigenic threats. As a species, we have so many possible responses to any challenge that someone somewhere is bound to be able to survive almost any pathogen around. The range of immune-response alleles, their different sensitivities and combinations, and their distributions in different gene pools helps decide how a vaccine must be crafted. If the vaccine antigen generally triggers a good response in African Americans but not East Asians, it answers only part of the question.

This is the first text I know that really shows BI at work in clinically important ways. It's a guided tour of the world of immunological attacks and responses, measured using BI tools - not just pathogens, but allergens, autoimmune triggers, and even possible cancer treatment. Beginners will have a rough time following the discussion, but this is a book for people deep in their specialty. It gave me a good idea of what questions are asked, and why, and how BI answers them. I look forward to seeing an immunological researcher's review of this text - from the pure BI stand point, it's narrow, but shows the versatility of the tools it chooses.

Channelguy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Genes and DNA: A Beginner's Guide to Genetics and Its Applications,Excellent Genetics for Beginnners book,"My dad has always been kind of an amateur naturalist, and he has recently been reading several of the various books by Richard Dawkins. As a biochemist working in the biotech industry, I have always encouraged him to read a little bit about molecular biology and genetics, field which I believe are important to learn about in order to gain a more complete understanding of how life really works. Recently, he asked me if I could recomend a good book on the subject of genetics. I found this quest not particularly easy. There are many excellent textbooks on genetics out there, but these are not really what I would call ""armchair reading."" Of course any college general biology textbook will have an excellent discussion of genetics and molecular biology - but again, too hard-core. One excellent book on genetics is the ""Cartoon Guide to Genetics"" by Larry Gonick and Mark Wheelis, but this book was written in 1991 and is now hopelessly out of date for this rapidly advancing field. Then there is ""Genetics for Dummies,"" but I thought the title of this book would be a bit insulting potentially.

Anyway - I came across this book by Charlotte Omoto and Paul F. Lurquin. I would encourage anyone interesting in biology and genetics to pick up a copy of this extremely well-written little book. I think this book is absolutely perfect. It starts out with a short introduction on the history of the discovery of DNA, then goes into an introduction to basic genetics concepts, such as the use of the Punnett square predict genetic outcomes, recessive vs. dominant traits, sex-linked traits, etc. It gives lots of very nice examples of Mendalian traits in humans. In chapter 4, there is a very nice discussion of the molecular biology of genetics - which is such a beautiful theory that it is a shame that most people don't know much about it. Chapter 5 goes into the use of bacteria to make human proteins - an extremely important part of modern molecular biology research. Chapter 6 has a discussion about genetically modified foods. Chapters 7,8, and 9 discuss chromosomal abnormalities, mutations, and recombination - which is all very important for an understanding of human (and non-human) genetics. Chapter 10 is my favorite - it gives a very well written description of the Hardy-Weinberg theory of how genes propogate in a population. This is all tied in with the theory of evolution in chapter 11. Chapters 12 and 13 then go into newsworthy topics such as nature-vs-nurture and human cloning.

All in all, it is a very well written book which everyone should read. My only criticism is that the figures are not as good as they could be. The authors need to hire a good artist to help them with the next edition! I think they're clear enough, but they could have been made a lot nicer. Still - I give the book a five star rating.

She persevered our of sheer curiosity and passion no matter what the obstacles were - and always some unusual teacher or helpful scholarship committee spotted her as gifted and managed to find a way for her to bloom.

Most books about women scientists treat them as walking dogs - but this one avoids political postering about feminism and explains Blackburn development as a result of her passion for lab work and finding answers. As an undergraduate, she sees herself as a Lab Rat not an exceptional student. Admirably, there is no emphasis on her challenges as a female until she finishes her undergraduate degree in England and goes to Yale University, where she first encounters blatent gender discrimination. Even then, she takes great pains never to complain about being treated differently from male researches, wary of being labeled a trouble-maker - and simply seeks venues where she can do her work. First and foremost, she is an avid scientist, never a wronged woman (despite the fact that she knew she was being discriminated against in pay, grants, and lab space - especially at UC Berkeley).

Realizing that she could not longer get the funds of support for further research at UC Berkeley she accepted a generous offer at the newly emerging biogenetic research campus of the University of California at San Francisco at Mission Bay. At last, she finally had the funds and lab space to complete her remarkable discoveries about telomers and telomerase - the secret to aging, fighting cancer - and understand how DNA eventually unravels in all species. In a unique cooperation with a psychologist, she documents how DNA break down in proportion to specific physical and emotional problems including aging, stress, lack of exercise, and other demonstrable factors. In particular, she documents how care givers of people with chronic illness, die younger than a control group without such responsibilies.

The book also describes her generosity as a researcher in giving her grad students and assistants credit for their work in support of her research. When she received the Nobel prize for medicine in 2010, after the book had been written a few years before, she shared it with her former student.

I'm an amateur science buff and read a lot of popular science. I found the biography superior to any other I've read about male or female scientists in explaining how Elizabeth Blackburn became a stellar scientist. I ordered the book after hearing Dr. Blackburn speak at Mission Bay. I was so impressed by her discoveries and charmed by her warmth that I wanted to learn more about her - before she received the Nobel. I told friends with me at the presentation that I thought she should receive a Nobel - and two years later was thrilled when she did.

Many people to whom I've given the book have been frustrated by the technical explanations of how DNA works. I'm an architect who studied some science as an undergraduate. I found the explanations clear and exciting. Readers who cannot understand the science in this book would do well to read Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle, and a good biography of James Watson, the discoverer of DNA. It is sad that the level of scientific knowledge, even among otherwise very well educated Americans, is appallingly limited.",13

SHK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Handbook of Analytic Philosophy of Medicine (Philosophy and Medicine),Analytic Philosophy of Medicine at the very front row,"This excellent book is really a landmark one. Nobody else has ever written such a comprehensive and detailed explanation
of the complex issue of Philosophy of Medicine. Sure, it is taken from the perspective of Analytic Philosophy and probably somebody else will write another such a great book from the perspective of Continental Philosophy. On top of the many well written chapters on the subjec-matter of logic within the several medical categories, it is for every doctor very good to know that epistemologically, in essence, medicine is a deontic discipline, this being clearly stated in the book.There are many other pearls
to be found in the book. And finally a great surprise is the incorporation and elaboration of fuzzy, for some, deviant logic in the
domain of medicine. An innovative approach, it will open up a new scientific terrain and with it much food for thought.
Really great, fascinating and very, very instructive ! Enjoy reading !

A. Menon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Life from an RNA World: The Ancestor Within,Interesting account of RNA and its potentials,"Im not sure what prompted me to buy this, I think it was a recommendation for having bought Wetware. This book is about RNA and some of its complexity and properties. In this exploration, or overview perhaps, it is argued that RNA if properly considered can potentially fill in many of our gaps in understanding about the origin of life. In reading this book, I got a perspective on not only RNA but what pioneering biologists work on to build a framework for understanding the origin of life. There are a lot of computational biology ideas that seem embedded in the experiments done and ideas used. For example the book starts out with defining the differences between organisms RNA as a metric on genetic difference. In addition there are some real life genetic programming experiments that are done with putting in various combinations of nucleotides and then letting the mixtures self select the best solutions. I am a bit mixed on the book as a whole as it is supposedly written for a general audience, but there is a substantial amount of the book that requires a lot of understanding of cell biology (which I dont have) and logic chains are used with a need for very specific knowledge that the audience of this book is really not what is claimed.

The first 2/3 of the book I was able to follow more thoroughly, it is presented in short chapters about specific topics. Some of these are very understandable by a wide audience, they talk about intelligent design, plausibility of RNA's place in evolution, how to define life etc... The chapters end with specific references which allow the interested reader to explore further the topics considered. However, as one gets further through the book, the ability to follow becomes harder and harder for the non-expert. The reference become 100% journal articles which to be honest, are obviously not for general audience, and the arguments used for and agaisnt are very specific, needing a solid backgrouond in what I think is deeper than an undergraduate experience in biology.

All in all, if one is interested in cell biology and evolution and some of the complexity and properties of biologicial phenomenon, this gives a lot of food for thought. But this book is definitely mainly written for people who already know the topics the author is discussing, not for a person with casual interests in the subject. This book argues I think quite convincingly about the plausibility of RNA as the origin of selp replicating organic matter, but after reading this without a strong background, one is not in a position to truly appreciate the arguments properly.",28
Marcello Malpighi,3.0 out of 5 stars,Life from an RNA World: The Ancestor Within,Interesting but was expecting more,"I bought it based on a review in Science. And also because I am a ""beginning of life"" nut: I own a good chunk of Stanley Miller's personal library. There were some interesting tidbits and I did learn quite a bit. However, the writer sometimes seems to forget his target audience: some chapters are so elementary that they seem written for a middle schooler, others are so technical that only a specialist can grasp them. When you use a new term: define it! The lexicon at the end is somewhat useful but not fully adequate. Also, a couple of chapters read a bit too much like an infomercial for SELEX. I am sure it is powerful, but it can't so wonderful that no mistakes are ever made and results can be taken at face value without independent corroboration. Overall, a good intro to the RNA world, but comes up short.",9

Deng-Ke Niu,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Short Guide to the Human Genome,The beginning of data manuals in biology,"The beginning of data manuals in biology.

As a theoretical biologist, I sometime complain that we have almost no handbooks on common vlaues of biological characters. By contrast, it is very easy to find such a book, like ""Tables of Physical and Chemical Constants"". To construct a hypothesis, often, you may need to know the sizes of introns and exons, the number of SINE in a genome, the weight of mouse liver. Before, we have to Search the values in dozens of papers, or study them by ourselves. The passion on an idea may be passed after a long-time lay-aside.

In reality, there are very few biological constants, the body weight of mice may vary several times. However, for most biologists, we do not need the exact value, but a relative size , or a range and median/mean value is OK.

Now, I see a handbook, to me, the book of Stewart Scherer, A Short Guide to the Human Genome, is the first useful one. Maybe, it marks a begining of a new era for theoretical biology. We welcome the author to expand the book to included all the values of common model organisms such as fission and budding yeast, C. elegan, fly, mice, etc.",1

Molly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Race in a Bottle: The Story of BiDil and Racialized Medicine in a Post-Genomic Age,Insightful book on race and public policy; must-read for health professionals,"This is a fascinating book on race and public policy that deserves a wide readership, especially among health professionals, professionals-in-training, and biomedical researchers. Kahn is a law professor who previously had an N.I.H. grant to examine racial classifications used in the U.S. census, so he has expertise in the area where biomedicine, law, and politics collide. Kahn's ground-breaking detective work uncovered the real story behind BiDil, a combination medicine famous as the first drug marketed specifically to African Americans. Far from being race-specific, BiDil began as a ploy to extend the life-time of a patent and evolved into a niche marketing strategy. ""Race in a Bottle"" is an inside story: Kahn testified at the FDA hearing that approved BiDil (he recommended approval but for everyone, not as a race-specific medicine). In the end, BiDil was a flop, and its story is only the entry point for Kahn's analysis. The trend in genome-based research is to attribute racial health disparities to genetic causes, with the ""fix"" being race-tailored medicines. With wit, insight, and exceptional clarity Kahn demolishes claims for race as biology and reveals the confusion between social/political definitions of race (which are very real) and biogeographical ones (which are generally unscientific). The confusion is maintained because, on the one hand, it's profitable for the pharmaceutical industry (and required for NIH-funded research), and on the other, it distracts from the real causes of health disparities rooted in structural racism and the market economy. Kahn's many examples are drawn from medicine and pharmacology. For instance, there's a longstanding belief among physicians that race is an important determinant of warfarin (anti-coagulant) dosing, and this is reflected in the algorithm used to figure the correct starting dosage. What actually determines warfarin response are genetic variants (SNPs or single base variants) present in all populations, and these can be identified by genotyping. With that information there is no need for ""race"" as a proxy based on population allele frequencies; in fact it is medically dangerous to assume that an individual will have a genotype based on ""race."" and it is pointless to include it in the algorithm. This book is vital because BiDil is not a fluke; other ""race-specific"" medicines are in the wings. Research on the cause of health disparities is crucial, but as Kahn shows, nearly all of these are due to the social consequences of racism, many of which affect health. Kahn urges ""care of the data"" by which he means choosing a definition of ""race"" appropriate for a study and explicitly described. He ends the book with helpful recommendations for changes in policy and research practices.",4

Brian M. Napoletano,4.0 out of 5 stars,Introductory Statistics with R (Statistics and Computing),Excellent for users new to R,"I purchased this book after wading through the R help files for what seemed like hours. I was looking for a simple and straightforward guide that I could refer to for the basic operations of R. I am currently teaching myself C++ and learning how to interact with the Unix environment, but have very little experience with statistical programming. Therefore, I was looking for an accessible reference to help me become more comfortable with the R environment. *Introductory Statistics with R* provides concise answers to the ""new user"" questions that inevitably arise when programming in a new environment. In addition to its role as a programming resource, Dalgaard provides very useful information about the statistical methods he describes. I find this feature very useful as well, as I can rarely recall all the details of various statistical procedures from memory. My only caution is that this is an *introductory* guide to R. You will not find instructions for most (if any) of the additional libraries available to R. That said, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning how to use R for statistical analyses.",17
David B. Thompson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introductory Statistics with R (Statistics and Computing),Excellent resource,"I bought this book a little over a year ago when a friend and colleague insisted I learn the R system for our collaborative work. I am not a professional statistician, but an engineer and researcher who needs and uses statistics in the course of my professional work.

I found this book approachable and informative from the non-professional perspective. (That is, from the viewpoint of a non-statistician.) I found enough examples to guide me through the process of bringing my datasets into the R environment, and then enough guidance to get me through the initial analyses necessary to make meaningful use of the statistical computations contained within the R system.

There are many other texts that treat the kinds of advanced statistics capability in the R system. Those are also necessary references for the non-statistician. There are also other texts on using the graphics subsystem present in R (which is substantial). Those references are also useful for preparation of reports and other written material.

But, this text is most useful as a primer for the system and is a first source on my shelf when I need to know the ""how-to"" of the basics. Then, if my needs are more substantial than those addressed by Dalgaard, I'll turn to other references.",3

If you understand basic statistics and know something about programming then this is an excellent introduction to how to use R to perform basic statistical analysis. It is not an R manual, as was stated in the preface. Nor is it an introductory statistics book by itself. It describes the analysis technique in high level, walks through the analysis step by step, and shows you how to use R to do the analysis. The chapter on linear models, specifically where he designs the matrices and dummy variables was a bit confusing. That was the only issue I had with the book.",6
Isaac S. Kohane,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introductory Statistics with R (Statistics and Computing),Twofold win: great introduction to useful statistics and R programming,"Despite the web, there are learning curves sufficiently steep that a well-organized book is the most effective introduction. However, too many of these introductions, particularly in programming and/or statistics are written with low content and high redundancy or with impenetrably high-density content. So, it is a rare sign of pedagogical mastery combined with the genuine confidence of the experienced practioner when an introductory book manages to achieve a balance that is just right.

As I become more familiar with R, I still carry around this book in my briefcase for the occasional reread during which I uncover a nugget I had missed. When I have told this to my colleagues in computer science or bioinformatics, they immediately reveal that they share my enthusiasm for Dalgaard's work.

Let's be clear: this is a book that walks you through introductory and highly useful statistics while introducing you to the most effective ways to use R to perform these biostatistical analyses. It is not a programming book, nor is that its intent.",47

The book is not for people interested in molecular aspects of DNA methylation, but it does not need to be, since such text would not be for a wide audience. My only critique would be that the author should add few more figures, that could make the text bigger pleasure to read and browse. If there are about 10 more drawings in the text I would give it full five stars. I have no doubt that with rapid development of epigenetics, this book will come in newer editions.

After reading and a couple days reflection, I ordered the book from Amazon. Oscar Wilde once said that a book not worth reading twice is probably not worth reading once. I strongly feel this book passes the OW test with flying colors.

I did not understand everything I read but, so what? I understood the general idea and since I have followed the so-called Human Genome revolution, it has certainly modified and vastly improved my understanding of life, all life. It should also be remembered that science is moving very fast in recent decades and, there will, no doubt, be better and more more knowledge via the bio revolution in the years to come. Do not depend on the media and TV to keep you abreast of these developments. TV hype and limited time cannot even scratch the surface if you want even a basic understanding of this and other, complex subjects.

Francis Crick boasted of having discovered the ""Secret of Life"" when he, a physicist, discovered the shape of the DNA molecule. It was a great discovery, but thinking that it, and it alone was the Secret of Life is an exaggeration. Followed, of course by similar claims when the human genome was fully mapped. A note of caution based on such claims might be that, we should not, think, that epigenetics is the final answer to our struggle to understand LIFE, per se, in its totality. We may never get to that point but efforts should never cease and we are lucky indeed to have such writers as Nessa Carey to give us a ring side seat into watching these developments unfold.

I read this book and also took a Coursera online course in epigenetics, but I still have no clear idea about the relationship between genetics and epigenetics as applied to inheritance patterns.

While it is an easy style, it is not an easy read. It becomes very technical in some parts. Her writing is seasoned with occasional light-hearted quips and plenty of interesting narratives. Maybe her book could have been made more user-friendly for the layman if she had put the very technical material in appendices and kept the warm, friendly chats in the main text. Such a tactic might help the less-technically-minded reader peruse her book if her intent was to capture a wide audience.

Is it possible that acquired characteristics can be inherited to the third, or even the fourth generation? Carey thinks so. She quotes Exodus 20:5, ""For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sins of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me Exodus,"" as a segue for chapter 6, ""The Sins of the Fathers."" She assures the reader that acquired characteristic can be passed on to several generations of offspring. In a narrowly defined sense, Lamarck was correct. Biology professors taught me that Lamarck was wrong, that acquired characteristics were not passed from parents to offspring, and that all inherited traits were based strictly and squarely on DNA.

Nessa Carey insists ""that for some very specific situations Lamarckian inheritance is taking place, and we have a handle on the molecular mechanism behind it."" (p. 110) The mechanism of epigenetics involves the methylation of DNA or histones. Methylation involves the attachment of a methyl group (-CH3) to the target molecule. There is also acetylation, phosphorylation, and other chemical modifications of DNA or histones that moderate the activity of genes.

On her website, Carey explains epigenetics this way:

""Every time we see two things which are genetically identical, but which aren't the same, we're seeing epigenetics in action. This affects huge amounts of life on earth and has a big impact on human health. The science is weird, heretical and fascinating.""

You have probably heard, ""You are what you eat."" In the case of honeybees, this is undoubtedly true. Carey explains how queen bees become queens and how worker bees (also female) become workers. She says that a virgin queen mates with several male bees (drones) before settling down to produce a hive of new bees. The drones usually come from other hives and very seldom from the same hive as the virgin queen. Nevertheless, a hive contains thousands of genetically identical bees. (p. 283) Of course, there are thousands of others that are genetically different from the group that is identical. Nevertheless, how does a larval bee become a queen rather than a worker?

Dr. Carey explains that young worker bees (nurse bees) feed all honeybee larvae royal jelly for the first three days after hatching. After that time, nurse bees feed royal jelly to only the larvae that are to become queens. She says that no one understands why the nurse bees continue to feed royal jelly to only a few of the larvae. Who decides which larvae should become queens? Maybe there is some genetic or epigenetic tag that clues the worker bees. Carey doesn't suggest this.The pattern of early feeding completely deter¬mines whether a larva will develop into a worker or into a queen.

This scenario ""just SHRIEKS epigenetics,"" remarks Carey [emphasis added].

I thought her discussion about rat babies who received much maternal care vs. the babies of mother rats who were lackadaisical at licking and grooming was very interesting. The well-nurtured babies became well-adjusted, calmer adults, while the less-nurtured babies became stressed-out adults. Carey describes several experiments that rule out purely genetic and psychological outcomes of maternal care. One might suppose that giving a juvenile rat a nurturing environment might improve the laid-back response to stress, but Carey leaves no doubt that good nurturing during the first week of a rat's life causes epigenetic changes. She said that ""being licked and groomed by the mother set off a chain of events that led to epigenetic changes in the cortisol receptor gene."" (p. 241)

She explains how experimenters determined this. For instance, baby rats that had nurturing mothers were switched to lackadaisical mothers after the first week of life. These babies still displayed the calmer, laid-back traits when subjected to stress as adults. Babies of lackadaisical mothers were switched to nurturing mothers, and they became stressed-out adults.

Dr. Carey examined the relationship between various diseases and epigenetic events. Is it possible that cancers could be cured if the right promoter regions of genes were methylated or demethylated? She explains that trying to prevent cancer via epigenetic modification could create worse problems for the patient. Even using epigenetics to promote longevity might actually cause cancer and early death.

The relationships in genetics and epigenetics are finely tuned, and as a creationist, I see the interdependent relationships as indicators of God's handiwork. Carey sees the same things as products of a long process of evolution.

Carey, like most evolutionists, believes that evolution produced the epigenetic systems. Presumably, because her book is about epigenetics and not evolution, she doesn't back up her occasional claims that epigenomes evolved. On the other hand, Thomas Woodward and James Gills claim the epigenome was designed in their book The Mysterious Epigenome: What Lies Beyond DNA.",7

What is surprising is that genetic changes carry over for many generations... so what we do today will affect our children.

Sometimes what happens to us is out of our control... but a lot of what happens is due to our choices.

The book only considers historical examples where things outside our control happen... but opens the door to a lot more.

Maybe Lamarke's ideas will get a new lease on life due to epigenetics?

Ross Chandler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Epigenetics Revolution: How Modern Biology Is Rewriting Our Understanding of Genetics, Disease and Inheritance",We'll be hearing a lot more about this,"I recommend this fascinating book. It describes how life form development is not always as simple a matter as a basic description of genetics might lead one to believe.

e.g. the big B little b explanation for blue eye inheritance.

Carrying out or ""expressing"" the instructions in the DNA code at the center of chromosomes is regulated by epigenetic markers on the surrounding molecular packaging. These markers can be changed to varying degrees during development and the effects can be expressed later in the development cycle.

For example the book describes how most of these markers are reset when a sperm fertilises an egg but some are not, allowing inheritance of acquired traits based on the environment which have not been encoded at the base DNA level. This explains why the off-spring of clones can be healthy while their cloned parents are not as their epigenetic markers were not reset by the cloning process.",10
Paul R. Fleischman M.D. author of Wonder: When and Why the World Appears Radiant.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Epigenetics Revolution: How Modern Biology Is Rewriting Our Understanding of Genetics, Disease and Inheritance","Carefully documented, stereotype-busting writing","This book is interesting and notably competent science writing. The proper audience for this book is someone with specific interests in genetics, and biology.
The word, “epigenetics” refers to all those ways in which influences are imposed on the genetic codes in DNA in our cells. Unfortunately, as Nessa Carey reminds us on page, 101, the word has been used in many different ways, and therefore a book on epigenetics ends up resembling a book called, “Many Topics About Genetics and Biology.” One of the strong points of this book is the author’s determination to provide the reader with a text that is thorough and up-to-date, and one of the problems with this book is the shotgun, or smorgasbord effect of trying to cover many topics related by an abstract concept, but not necessarily very similar to each other.
This book consists of sixteen chapters, each one of which deals with a particular cellular phenomenon in which the genetics of DNA is superceded or modified by some other effect. For example, in Chapter Two, the author discusses cell differentiation, why the cells in our body all contain the same DNA but make different tissue types. In Chapter Five, the author discusses, “Why Aren’t Identical Twins Actually Identical.” She points out that identical twins, who have exactly the same DNA sequences in their chromosomes, are not necessarily concordant for genetic diseases such as schizophrenia. She reminds us that the DNA occurs in a kind of “dampening field,” something like a dimmer switch or a volume dial, which determines whether and how the DNA code gets expressed. In Chapter Six, called, “The Sins of the Fathers,” Carey describes how in some exceptional circumstances, environmental influences can be passed across the generations as if our genes could learn, the kind of thing that Lamarck promoted, and that has generally been disproven by modern genetics, but which occasionally pertains, for example the way starvation during warfare can influence subsequent multiple generations.
In Chapter Eight, “The Battle of the Sexes,” Carey takes us through the remarkably complex stages by which our father’s and our mother’s chromosomes can be coordinated when they form a single new entity. In Chapter Nine, the author discusses the complexity involved with the fact that males have only one X chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes, one of which is a duplicate that therefore needs to be shut off. The silencing of one X chromosome in every cell in every woman, and the asymmetry of chromosomes in every male (who have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome instead of a pair of chromosomes) and the possibility for errors in these mechanisms, opens a pathway to interesting speculation about important social issues, such as the biology of gender, or sexuality, issues which the author chooses to refrain from considering in this cautiously scientific book.
My favorite chapter was Chapter Ten, “The Message is not the Medium,” in which the author does an outstanding job of authoritatively dismissing the widespread, misguided idea that DNA codes for protein, and that DNA which does not code for protein is therefore “junk.” She shocks the reader with the dramatic statement that the complexity of living organisms correlates better with the percentage of the genome that does not code for protein than the percent that does. Organisms become more complex, evolving from bacteria, through mice, through humans, not by creating more proteins, but by regulating proteins with greater complexity. At a certain evolutionary point, proteins have become refined, and mutually fitted to the extent that few modifications to them can become adaptive. At this junction, most protein modifications create errors and problems; therefore, from this evolutionary point onward, for organisms to adapt and evolve, few future changes in protein structure can be made, and instead, the way in which proteins can be regulated becomes a new avenue of selection and adaptation.
Carey guides us through detailed descriptions about how the genome is regulated through various methods, such as methylation, acetylation, histone changes, and most remarkably, the way that DNA codes non-coding RNA, which in turn regulates DNA. DNA itself creates RNA molecules that act like dial-turners or button pushers, augmenting or reducing DNA expression. Only two percent of the human genome codes for the manufacture of protein. “The fact that ninety-eight percent of the human genome does not code for protein suggests that there has been a huge evolutionary investment in the development of complicated non-coding RNA-mediated regulatory processes…Complicated networks of molecules influence how, when and to what degree proteins are expressed.”
Another example of Nessa Carey’s carefully documented, stereotype-busting writing, is her emphasis that, “Cancer is not a one-off event. Cancer is a multi-step process.” She points out that women who inherit a mutated BRCA1 gene, are at high risk for breast cancer, but do not necessarily get cancer because other defects have to accumulate as well. We are reminded that cancer is not an entity, but a compounding of replication errors, environmental assaults, viral parasites in nucleic acid, and unbalanced patterns within our inbuilt flexibility systems that are intended to give varying permissions to stem cells’ full potentials. Much of our life is not driven, but poised, and its regulators are multiple.
The thing I enjoyed most about The Epigenetics Revolution was Nessa Carey’s uncompromising attitude towards the complexity, multiplicity, and unexpectedness within the mechanisms that regulate genes. What I enjoyed least about this book is the attempt to cover too many topics, some of them only tangentially related to others. This book has useful charts, illustrations, and meaningful cartoons. Another excellent feature of the author’s style is the emphasis on science as a living and personal process. The book recounts many experiments and counter-experiments and familiarizes us with the human side of scientific dialogue and argument.
This book is more interesting than pleasant, more arduous than easy, and it is not for the average reader, but I constantly felt like cheering for the excellence of Nessa Carey who is so determined to bring to our attention the wonder of genetic inventiveness within our life.

Review by Paul R. Fleischman author or Wonder: When and Why the World Appears Radiant",4
Michael Charlton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Epigenetics Revolution: How Modern Biology Is Rewriting Our Understanding of Genetics, Disease and Inheritance",A welcomed readable book for a complicated yet important subject,"It's difficult to explain why epigenetics is such an important subject and even harder to make sense of it when you, like me, have no science background. Fewer subjects however, have greater implications for our future health than the amazing discoveries in the field of epigenetics. A short example: The author discusses a laboratory experiment where lab rats are ""altered"" so as to act as if they had mental retardation; they are then ""cured"". Sounds impossible? sure. Was it done? you betcha. A possible cure for people with MR? yeah, possibly and people with drug addictions and people with cancer,etc. etc.

This is not to say that these ""cures"" are right around the corner and even with the developments in this field of epigenetics, we probably won't see these cures in my life time but it's a very exciting field.

Briefly, Dr. Carey describes how this phenomenon was even discovered. Mapping the human genome in the 1990's was expected to yield a ""map"" of over 300,000 genes but less than a third of that was actually discovered and ""mapped."" so how do we explain how identical twins, with identical DNA, produce one child with extraordinary gifts and another with learning disabilities. Enter the world of epigenetics. If you are at all interested in public health, or criminal justice or any field where you have to explain the human condition or its future, this book is a must read. Buy it, steal it, do whatever you have to do but please read it.",5

The author writes in a relentlessly clear style. Mercifully free of hype and fluff, neither dumbed down nor obscurely technical, she delivers just the right amount of molecular details illustrated with plenty of examples.

She gives ample praise and credit to the scientists pioneering the field, making me long for a world in which such people received adulation from a public in large part more interested in what the Kardashians are up to than the work of people changing the world. Sigh.

J. Myers,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Epigenetics Revolution: How Modern Biology Is Rewriting Our Understanding of Genetics, Disease and Inheritance",I've been looking for an introduction to Epigenetics and this book is a great place to start.,"I liked that it gives capsule introductions to researchers and takes us into their labs, Most ot the time when I started to lose my grip on a description Ms. Carey would present one of her examples (which some other reviewers found too elementary) and I would get that ""click"" that would make sense of it. I'll bet Ms. Carey is an excellent teacher.

The book is only somewhat comprehensive and linear. That is not a criticism, as you will see below. I appreciated the author's strategy of following discoveries through labs and linking the bits together with discoveries by other researchers. I'm sure the presentation in the book is much, much more orderly and progressive than the process felt to those in the middle of it, but I got a little bit of the feeling of scientists transported to an unexpected world (unlike those searching for the expected Higgs Boson, which I'm sure has an excitement all its own) .

I said above that this book is not comprehensive or linear. I said that as a way of comparing this book to Developmental Plasticity and Evolution (by Mary Jane West-Eberhard), which opened the door to this mind-blowing world for me. That book is exceptionally clearly written but I had to really work at it because the language is at an advanced level of specialization in the field. Just to encourage you to read it, the summary of that 600-page book is ""genetics follows evolution."" Don't use the Kindle edition becasue you need to look at the illustrations together with the text, and even the best of Kindle will not be able to get what you need on the screen at the same time.

DeKay's Opinion,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Epigenetics Revolution: How Modern Biology Is Rewriting Our Understanding of Genetics, Disease and Inheritance",A really great place to start,"Most people know a little about DNA, genes and even molecular biology. The question becomes where to go from there. Nessa Carey's Epigenetics Revolution is an excellent place to go. This is one of those books, written for the non-specialist, that shows you how much you didn't know. The style is friendly for the average reader which makes sure the book will be read! There are certain areas of this book that are outstanding:

1. choice of subject and material with a natural development. The chapters flow nicely.
2. the level of detail. A little biochemistry that gives the feeling that you can understand what is really happening.
3. explanations built on Waddington's epigenetic landscape (very intuitive), clear simple figures and yes redundancy which can be useful.

I think Dr. Carey benefited from being a teacher and she seems to understand just where the reader can use reminders (redundancy that may irritate the more advanced reader). Dr. Carey seems to understand the areas that are important in this field and is generous in her praise of original researchers. This is actually a good way to highlight what is important in their work. the accuracy of her judgment is supported by her remark that the work of Gurdon and Yamanaka are worthy of a Nobel Prize, which they won shortly after this book was published.

""Honest Jim"" puts any such misgivings on the part of the reader to complete rest by giving a brutally candid and perhaps even one-sided recounting of the events that led to the fateful 1953 discovery.

This 226 page book, first published in 1968, has gained much notoriety and rightly so for some of the statements made by the author would seem bold, innopportune and outright outrageous.

There are a lot of personalities involved and like another reviewer I'll list the most important ones and their situation in 1951

1. James Watson - A 23 year old recently-graduated molecular biologist and geneticist from Indiana University who goes to Copenhagen University as a postdoctoral fellow in 1950 at the behest of his supervisor Salvador Luria and collaborator Max Delbruck in order to learn nucleic-acid chemistry necessary for tackling DNA's structure. A year later, after hearing about X ray crystallography (XRC) from Maurice Wilkins of King's College, London, he switches to Cavendish Lab at Cambridge University to work in Max Perutz's lab with the hope of getting to learn XRC.

2. Maurice Wilkins - Of King's College, London. A Physicist turned Biologist who uses XRC to generate photographs of DNA.

3. Francis Crick - A 35 year old, loud mouthed PhD student of Max Perutz at Cavendish lab who becomes Watson's close colleague and collaborator. He makes his ambitious wish clearly known to all - to discover DNA's structure and beat the American chemist Linus Pauling at his own game. The only problem preventing him from pursuing this along with his dissertation work is that it's unethical to hijack someone else's project within England - in this case, Maurice Wilkins's in nearby King's College. Once he teams up with J.D. Watson, all concerns for ethics go down the drain.

4. Linus Pauling - The famous Caltech, Pasadena based Chemist who is fresh out of his triumph of deciphering correctly the alpha-helix structure of proteins and is on an all out mission to decode the structure of the DNA. He is more hands-on and prefers to deduce molecular structure by building trial-and-error toy models of biomolecules that satisfy experimentally measured data instead of resorting to purely XRC based approach.

5. William Lawrence Bragg - The son in the father-son duo of W.H.Bragg-W.L.Bragg who developed the technique of X-ray crystallography for probing crystal structures and after whom the Bragg's law is named. He is the director of Cavendish lab and is particularly interested in having the DNA structure figured out at Cambridge before any outsider beats them to it.

6. Rosalind Franklin - The most tragic character in this tale of intrigue. She's been hired to assist Maurice Wilkins on the DNA project and XRC is her specialization. Believes in systematically deducing DNA's structure purely from XRC instead of playing with toy models. Has a sour working relationship with Maurice Wilkins and prefers to carry out her task independently. Maurice frequently complains about her to Watson and Crick who on their part try to pump him for XRC photographs generated by Rosalind.

The whole book is a very quick read with some pages containing photographs of the people mentioned and some of the handwritten technical letters that JDW wrote back to Max Delbruck. The 2012 special annotated edition of this book has a lot more illustrations. Even though this book is aimed at a general audience there are a lot of terminologies (such as sugar-phosphate backbone, nucleotides, tautomers, etc) which are not clearly explained and may require the reader to frequently look up Wikipedia.

As for my views on how the events unfolded, I consider it a tragic irony that the structure of the DNA was ultimately decoded not by the experienced and righteous Linus Pauling but instead by two youthful, relatively unknown braggarts at Cavendish Lab that were trying to imitate Pauling's model-building tactics. Also JDW's occasional gibes at Rosalind Franklin (or ""Rosy"" as he called her mockingly) seem annoying and though he does try to patch up his professional relationship with her by giving her full credit for generating the excellent XRC photographs, it feels half-hearted and too late. The what-if question remains that she might have perhaps beaten them all to the solution only if she and Maurice had been aware that JDW and FC were closing in on the answer. But then again she might have also suffered the same fate as Lise Meitner and Jocelyn Bell did. Perhaps her own memoir on the events that transpired might have thrown light on what was happening at that time. All this is left for the reader to speculate upon.

My only complaint about this book is that it ends in a very anti-climactic fashion. After leading the reader through the neck and neck race that went on, JDW finishes the memoir in a mundane fashion. All along he makes it very clear that glory is all he cares about. To each his/her own, I suppose. After all not everyone can be like Grigori Perelman. What JDW manages to successfully capture in this book and convey to the readers are - the sense of urgency that prevailed at that time among DNA researchers, the styles and techniques adopted to infer molecular structure and the ultimate thrill of discovery. For this sake alone, this book deserves to be read. (And also because it features on Library of Congress' ""Books that Shaped America"" list)

Lastly, here are some excerpts that will demonstrate why this book is considered scandalous
1. The opening line of Chapter 1 begins memorably as such - ""I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood."" One can only imagine what FC's first reaction could have been when he read that line.

2. On the sticky ""Why-only-me?"" situation that Maurice Wilkins found himself in - ""All this was most unsettling to Maurice. He had not escaped into biology only to find it personally as objectionable as physics, with its atomic consequences. The combination of both Linus and Francis breathing down his neck often made it very difficult to sleep. But at least Pauling was 6000 miles away and even Francis was separated by a 2 hour rail journey. The real problem, then, was Rosy. The thought could not be avoided that the best home for a feminist was in another person's lab.""

3. On W.L.Bragg - ""For too long he had lived under the shadow of his famous father, with most people falsely thinking that his father, not he, was responsible for the sharp insight behind Bragg's law."" This is awkward considering that the foreword to this book was written by W.L.Bragg and on his part W.L.Bragg states gracefully ""Those who figure in this book must read it in a very forgiving spirit.""",5
laurenjayne,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA,A Great Book!,"The Double Helix, A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA, is a great book, which I would highly recommend. Written by James D. Watson, it is a novel about the adventures and struggles James Watson and Francis Crick went through to finally discover the double helix structure. The book is very well written and you can never put the book down. The subject is so informative and interesting that you can't help but keep flipping through the pages. This was such an amazing discovery, which makes the book that much better to read. Watson is great at thoroughly explaining the challenges they went through. They fail many times, like all scientists sometimes do, but it all paid off in the end. He tells the story very well, and explains the different encounters he had with many different scientists. He talks about his times working with Crick in the Cavendish laboratory, and what they went through to finally discover DNA. Watson writes a lot about the scientific part of his discovery, but also writes about the adventures and vacations he went on, which make the story that much more interesting. The novel also has pictures in it, which I love. They help me follow the plot of the story, and help me form an image in my head of what he is talking about. Some of the images are also diagrams that are labeled to help you understand the scientific part of the book. I would recommend this novel to anyone, even if you are not interested in science or DNA very much. The book is well written and gives a great story of how one of the best discoveries of all time was made.",1

Watson""","""The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of The Structure of DNA"", James D. Watson, Simon & Shuster, NY 1968/2001. ISBN-13: 978-0-7432-1630-2, PB 226 pages, 20 B/W Photos & 11 Diagrams, plus 3 pg. Foreword by Sir L. Bragg & 4 pg. Intro. by S. Nasar. 8 1/2"" x 5 1/2"".

Written by Dr. James D. Watson in 1968, reprinted several times, this is one of the most intriguing, personal stories of scientific endeavors written to unravel the molecular basis of heredity and the genetic code of life itself, the DNA molecule - deservingly referenced as the Holy Grail of scientific inqiry. With an explanatory apology, Watson describes his maturation from an initial lazy undergraduate at Univ. of Chicago having primary interest in ornithology and avoiding chemistry and physics courses,to doing post-doctoral research abroad, first in Copenhagen and subsequently in Cambridge where he began serious research with Francis Crick that culminated in elucidating the molecular structure of the double helix DNA molecule with base-pairing of A-T and G-C, allowing a model construct possessing correspondence to its X-ray crystalline lattice structure. Much of the time it appeared to a 'Mission Impossible'. Success came in 1953, Watson was then 25 years old.

The author's prose and pace of relating this story reveals the passion of his quest to establish his mark in science - and he relates intimate anecdotes of his cohorts, teachers and the scientific cult of divisions enjoyed by the scholarly, erudite academicians in England and elsewhere. In the end, he shared along with his associate Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins, the Nobel Prize in 1962. The future of medicine was forever changed. The book is a compelling, refrehing read for anyone with a modicum of curiosity - a science background is not essential.",5

Out of all the required reading that I have had to do in the sciences, this was by far my favorite. Watson is quick, funny, and tells a compelling story. Watson is somewhat biased (aren't we all) but he tells a fairly objective story from HIS point of view. I loved the way the book kept me on the edge of my seat and thus I read it very quickly. For those of you who are not science people, this book will not ""go over your head"". This book describes a critical discovery that influences us all today. Read it!",1
shel99,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA,Fascinating,"This firsthand account of the discovery of DNA dispels a lot of the notions that ousiders have about how science really works. Watson's descriptions of the competition, politics, dead ends, personality clashes, mistakes, and eventually inspiration reveal that discovery is not as clear-cut a process as it sometimes might seem.
Watson is honest in his introduction that his account is just that, the story told through his own point of view, complete with possible faulty memories and personal prejudices. I was intrigued by the portrayals of the personalities of so many famous figures that I've been learning about for years in my biology and genetics classes - Francis Crick, of course, along with Maurice Wilikins, Rosalind Franklin, Linus Pauling, and many more. I was touched by Watson's admission at the end of the book that his unfavorable impressions of Rosalind Franklin stemmed from the fact that she was a woman trying to make a name for herself in the male-dominated world of scientific research in the 1950s.
There is quite a bit of biological jargon in this book, and though it could probably be read by someone without any knowledge of genetics, it will be appreciated more by readers with some background. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in genetics and science.",1
Ralph D. Hermansen,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA,The Double Helix,"I recommend this book to anyone with a curiosity about DNA or an inside view of the world of science. It is a book about personalities, egos, and following one's dreams. There is only enough technical stuff in the book for the story to make sense. The author, himself, avoided chemistry except when it became vital to learn. Yet, he and Francis Crick beat the greatest chemist of our times (i.e., Linus Pauling) in a race to determine the structure of DNA. Personally, I found this book to be a suprisingly delightful read.

Lauren Magnussen,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA,C+,"Honest yet condescending and superficial. These adjectives would be the best way of describing not only the tone of this memoir, but also the personality of its author, the famed James D. Watson who, with the help of others, discovered the structure of DNA. The slight tome gives a unique, inside-look at the inner workings and egos of the scientific community, especially in regards to winning fame and renown. In fact, that seems to be the only goal - there isn't much regard to the fact that their biological work with DNA and helices could actually benefit society. The quest for the Nobel Prize is the dominant theme of the book, and the author is very alienating in this regard. The ending is abrupt and frankly anticlimactic, although, as previously stated, the honesty was rather refreshing. However, the memoir was filled with suspense and intriguing in its descriptions of bickering and competition between scientists. It would have been nice to see some analysis or reflection, but there is little imagery or imagination. The Double Helix is literal and informative, and distinguishes itself only by being the first of its kind. It's more personal than a thesis but less inspiring than a textbook.",3

J. Rosenbaugh,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA,I Must Not Be the Target Audience,"** The Double Helix was read as the December selection for our book club. **

I marginally enjoyed reading The Double Helix simply because I never would have read it had it not been a selection by my book club. I enjoyed the perspective, and did find the final chapters engaging as the final pieces of the DNA puzzle were discovered. The book as a whole, however, was quite difficult to get through with feigned interest. Watson recounts the experience by pulling from personal letters and his journal, and it is quite obvious to the reader throughout. The writing style and quality is subpar, and he certainly focuses on aspects of the experience that I doubt many readers care about.

The book itself is not horrible, and this first hand account certainly carries value, but it isn't something I would recommend to anyone other than those with a very keen desire to understand the discovery of the structure of DNA.",1

M. Spencer,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA,Horribly Written,"In my 5th attempt to read this book (err rather start it) as required reading for a class, I immediately noticed typos as well as the author's inability to refer to all of the ""characters"" by one name; instead going back and forth between their first names or last - after a while making it very confusing with all of the Watson's, Wilkins, etc....as to who was who. Now I'll have to assemble a character sheet because this otherwise brilliant man completely missed that we as the reader are not going to have an easy time remembering the names of EVERYONE he mentions, let alone properly pairing their first & last correctly. Ps - as a woman in science his references to ""Rosy"" are typical, sexist, debasing, etc...She was a feminist who's fellow colleagues thought she'd be better off if she'd doll it up and be less opinionated. Right, because we should just all be - quiet and pretty. If it weren't required, I wouldn't have bothered reading this man's ""interpretation"" of the events as they transpired.

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lateral DNA Transfer: Mechanisms and Consequences,Excellent,"The fact that lateral (or ""horizontal"") gene transfer can occur between living organisms is not only an established fact in modern genetics, it is also used by those who are against the practice of genetic engineering. The argument is usually set in the context of using transgenic strategies to transfer genes from two unrelated species. If performed in edible crops for example, this might induce, via lateral gene transfer, dangerous bacterial strains that evolve rapidly from the natural ones inside the human digestive system. Since the use of genetic engineering in agriculture is becoming more and more prevalent today, it is imperative by all concerned to find out in detail just what the fuss is all about concerning lateral gene transfer. The author has written a fine overview of this topic, and can serve both the student of genetics as well as those who are not experts in genetics but who have a need to understand it. The author reviews some of the molecular biology needed in the beginning chapters of the book.
The author introduces lateral DNA transfer as a phenomenon that can occur ""surprisingly often"" and can become stably incorporated in the recipient. His first example of it concerns the transfer of marine bacteriophages in the oceans. Each milliliter contains on the order of ten million viruses, most of these being bacteriophages, which infect bateria. When these phages grow, some of them pick up the genes of the host cell and transfer them via infection to a new cell. The transferred sequence then can become stable, and from experiments this happens one out of 100,000,000 times. This translates into 2 million billion times per second! The author also cites evidence for lateral DNA transfer from the sequencing of genomes.
Three chapters of the book are devoted to the occurrence of lateral DNA transfer in prokaryotes, one of the most important ones being antibiotic resistance in microbes. In addition, special blocks of genes called ""pathogenicity islands"" can be transferred by bacteriophages using transduction. He also overviews the genome sequencing evidence for lateral transfer in prokaryotes. Some of the more interesting topics discussed in these chapters include: 1. The 'transposons', some of which can direct lateral transfer, with the simplest (the simple insertion elements) now numbering in the thousands. To a reader with some knowledge of physics, it would be interesting to quantify what the ""mobility"" of a transposon is. In addition, transposons can mobilize pathogenicity islands. 2. The 'integrons', which are mobile gene arrays that also promote dispersal of antibiotic resistance genes. The author gives the reader a few research questions regarding integrons. 3. The discussion on the possibility that all genes present in certain DNA phages may be accessible to any phage, via intermediate hosts. 4. For newcomers to microbiology and genetics (like myself), the observation by the author that disease bacteria are only slightly different genetically from normal ones. 5. The ability of some bacteria to hide from the host immune system via a network of sugar chains. 6. The occurrence of 'gene transfer agents', which bring about spontaneous transfer of genetic markers between strains of bacteria. 7. The fact that most of the E.coli genome is a result of lateral transfer. 8. The ""Selfish Operon Hypothesis"". 9. The discussion of gene transfer between bacteria on the environment. The author reviews the research, and concludes that it certainly does occur naturally. Engineered genes will thus no doubt do the same, but would be a ""small drop in the ocean of global DNA exchange"", according to the author.
The next 5 chapters cover lateral transfer in eukaryotes, with retroviruses being the first important mechanism. The nuclear membrane must be traversed for eukaryotes, making lateral transfer more difficult. An entire chapter is devoted to the discussion of the role of lateral transfer in the AIDS epidemic. Mobile elements, called 'retrotransposons"" also play a role in lateral transfer in eukaryotes, via the use of RNA. So also to 'DNA transposons' via the DNA-mediated pathways. Some interesting discussions in these chapters include: 1. Transfer via transient exposure of genomes to chromosomes containing transposons. 2. The process called ""homing"", by which transposition of mobile introns takes place. 3. The discussion of DNA transposons in maize. 4. The argument that lateral transfer must take place in animals in order to avoid extinction. 5. The question as to whether there are LTR retrotransposons, as well as mariner or hAT transposons in the human genome. 6. The role of lateral transfer in the evolution of the vertebrate immune system.
The last 3 chapters of the book discuss the occurrence of lateral transfer between species, the regulation of DNA transfer, the role of lateral transfer in the origin of sex, and some speculations by the author. Interesting discussions here include: 1. DNA transfer from bacteria to plants via crowngalls. 2. The T-DNA transfer system. 3. The possibility of gene transfer into mammalian tissues by eating DNA in food. The author concludes that further studies are needed to prove this possibility. 4. The different strategies employed by eukaryotes for supressing the efficiency of DNA transfer systems, the most interesting of these being RNA interference and cosuppression, the study of the latter originating in horticultural experiments. The author also lists several open questions in the study of RNA interference. 5. The antagonism between the immune system and lateral transfer in vertebrates. 6. The 'interferon' system and its ability to suppress virus replication. 7. The relation between genome size and lateral transfer. What is most surprising in this discussion is the sizes of some genomes relative to the human genome, some (lily plants for example) considerably larger. 8. The strategies that the immune system and pathogens employ to fight each other. Salmonella for example, employs a particularly clever strategy called ""phase variation"", which inverts a segment of the genome containing a transcription initiation sequence.
In the last paragraphs of the book, the author encourages the continued study of lateral gene transfer, not only for its impact in genetic engineering, but also for acquiring a understanding of how all lifeforms are connected to each other.",10

Ron Braithwaite,4.0 out of 5 stars,DNA Repair and Mutagenesis,"Simplify, Simplify, Simplify","This tome, while a reasonably complete expose of current science regarding DNA repair, is, perhaps, less than a comprehensive, easily understood discussion of the subject. It is OK as a reference source but certainly not for light bedtime reading.

I'll explain. I believe that part of a good teacher's excellence is his ability to make a complex subject comprehensible to his students. Certainly, a reader can criticize my criticism in claiming that this subject is sooooo complex as to defy simplification. I completely disagree and aim to prove it. I believe that a tome of this sort can be reduced to two forms of information and data: 1. to put theory and data into a comprehensive form. 2. to place complex data into a more detailed form.

I think the authors attempted this by placing a summary at the end of each chapter. This is commendable and routine but, in my opinion, inadequate. It is science for the initiated but, as a reasonably well-read pathologist, I really think I should be able to follow the discussion without excessive difficulty. Naively, perhaps, I regard this as more the authors' problem than my problem.

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,3.0 out of 5 stars,Evolutionary Computation in Bioinformatics (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Artificial Intelligence),A good literature survey,"The subject of this book would seem a natural one, given the evolutionary paradigm in biology. Genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming have now found use in many different fields such as physics, financial engineering, network modeling, and computational radiology, to name a few. This use will no doubt continue as computer processing power increases in the future. Although genetic/evolutionary approaches are still much more effective from a computational point of view than strict combinatorial ones, they are still very time intensive, and for many problems have yet to compete with ordinary Monte Carlo techniques. This book gives a brief overview of how evolutionary algorithms are used in bioinformatics, with emphasis on genetic sequence alignment and protein folding. The book does not offer in-depth discussion on these algorithms, but does give references where more information can be obtained. Therefore the book could be described as a literature survey, at least for the chapters that I read, which did not include those on protein folding.
The book is written for the computer scientist who wants to move into bioinformatics, and the biologist, who needs more background in these types of algorithms. Therefore, the editors of the book include two introductory chapters, one introducing bioinformatics for computer scientists, the other an introduction to evolutionary computation for biologists. The latter is more detailed, and the authors introduce the biologist to some of the elementary aspects of evolutionary computation. One interesting, but too short discussion is on the ""No Free Lunch Theorem"", which implies that evolutionary programs are not in any sense ""universal"", in that the choice of such a program will depend on the problem at hand, and in fact there may be many such programs for the problem, each with their own performance properties. The theorem is not proved in this book, but references to the proof are given. However, the proof involves a level of mathematics that a biologist would probably not have knowledge of, and so this reference would not be accessible to such a reader. In addition, the theorem has generated a lot of controversy, but the authors do point this out. The authors also discuss effectively the difference between the analytical and heuristic approaches to sequence alignment, setting the stage for later chapters in the book. The problem of local search algorithms getting ""trapped"" in local minima is also given a very intuitive and understandable treatment by the authors.
The book also includes a discussion on the ""DNA sequence reconstruction problem"". Algorithms for dealing with this problem are recommended and the the problem is presented as one in integer programming. The authors present a hybrid evolutionary algorithm for dealing with this problem. They characterize this algorithm as being hybrid since it does make use of ""crossover"" operators and a heuristic ""greedy-improvement"" method. The discussion of this algorithm is only brief, but references are given. However the main reference is not yet available as it is very recent and in press, and, although the authors do include a fairly lengthy discussion of computational experiments, without a detailed description of the algorithm or source code, their results cannot be checked or validated.
The contrast between optimization theory and evolutionary algorithms is a common theme in the book, with emphasis on the use of evolutionary algorithms to design scoring schemes for sequence alignment where optimization issues can be ignored. The difference between the optimal alignment obtained by various mathematical techniques and the correct (biological) alignment is carefully pointed out. Thus one must be able to tell whether an objective function is relevant from a biological standpoint. In chapter 5 of the book for example, the author introduces an alignment algorithm based on a combination of simulated annealing (SA), and genetic algorithms (GA), called appropriately SAGA. This chapter is the most helpful one in the book, for the author gives pseudocode for this algorithm, with Web links given for obtaining the source code. This allows the interested reader to study the efficacy of the SAGA algorithm in doing muliple sequence alignment.
The use of simulated evolution to find optimal neural networks for identifying coding regions is discussed in chapter 9 of the book. The use of genetic algorithms to assign the weights in a neural network is well-known. The authors point out a further advantage in their use, namely that evolutionary neural networks can adapt to unexpected inputs on their own, and thus do not require any intervention on the part of the user. References are given that elaborate on the power of this approach. Readers who have worked with neural networks will understand fully the need for improvements over back-propagation and the need for automatic topology selection. The authors do not show however that the function-approximation ability of neural networks, so important from both a mathematical and applications standpoint, is improved by their approach.",14
M. Werner,4.0 out of 5 stars,DNA: The Secret of Life,Watson Provides an Excellent Summary with his characteristic wit and sometimes polarizing approach,"I assigned this book to the students of an honors class I recently taught at Lake Superior State University, entitled ""DNA: The Secret of Life"". Not only was the name of this course the same as the book, but I closely matched the order of topics presented in the class to those found in the book. Because there are only 13 short chapters, this allowed for reading assignments of approximately one chapter per week to fill out a 14 week semester. The book not only covers some of the early history that led to the discovery of DNA as the genetic material, but it also examines the complex issues brought about by having an increased knowledge of the hereditary molecule. In addition to reading the book, our class also watched several episodes of the companion PBS documentary of the same name, thus enhancing the reading experience.

I found Watson's writing style easily approachable and targeted to the advanced high school or college educated reader. The interjection of personal stories and encounters that Watson had with various researchers provided insights that only one of the discoverers of the structure of this molecule could provide. Watson has often been viewed as a polarizing figure, and his writing pulls no punches on certain topics such as the ethical nature of genetic testing, evolution of humans, the race to describe the human genome, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). While making clear his own views on these topics, he provides enough information that the critical reader is left with a feeling that many of the dilemmas presented by the DNA molecule are complex and have no ""right"" answer.",1
Ralph D. Hermansen,5.0 out of 5 stars,DNA: The Secret of Life,DNA The secret of Life,"If you want to know something about the role of DNA in the 21st century, who could be a better source of information than the man, who discovered its structure and pioneered its technology. That man is James Watson, the author of ""DNA The Secret of Life"".

Watson and Crick beat Chemistry's superstar, Linius Pauling, in the race to decipher DNA's chemical structure in 1953. Since then, science has made amazing progress in broading and applying that knowledge. Watson tells that story in this book. He, himself, played very important roles in pushing the scientific envelope, including his leadership of the Human Genome Project.

In the last second, our bodies each produced millions of new cells. Watson explains how this process works, starting with the reading of the DNA code and the activities of messenger and transfer RNA in assembling a protein. We humans, were not content to merely understand this process. We audaciously put those tiny factories to work for us. We learned how to splice DNA at a point if our choosing. We learned how to insert a gene of our choosing into a bacteria's DNA. We put the cell's factories to work for us making medical products. If we only had a minute sample of DNA, we learned how to make millions of copies of it. In short, we created the biotechnology industry.

Watson tells how Amgen and Genentech raced to be first to produce human insulin by recombinant DNA processing. It was another race against time.

He tells about the Human Genome Project (HGP), which was perhaps more ambitious than putting a man on the moon. Consider that our DNA is billions of letters long. Enormous breakthrough were made in the chemical analysis techniques. The sequencing rate was made faster and faster by brilliant breakthroughs. The HGP, once thought to be impossible, was finished ahead of schedule.

DNA technology will replace many of today's medical techniques in the years ahead. It allows us to understand the enemy and to attack it in a precise manner. The cure of cancers and AIDS will come from DNA technology. Heart disease too. Watson explains the hows and whys of future medical advances.

Gene therapy is in its infancy. Imagine having all the cells in your body made more perfect.

Tracing human origins, finding the ancestral paths of living things, fingerprinting with DNA, forecasting the health of a human embryo, and other topics are also covered in this book.

James Watson: He be the man!!

AG Bell,3.0 out of 5 stars,DNA: The Secret of Life,"Recommended, with the caveat that it is now out of date scientifically","This book provides a well rounded approach to DNA from a historical, scientific, and social perspective. It covers the history of the discovery of the double helix structure and then follows with subsequent major breakthroughs, the social fallout from genetically engineered crops, the rise of big-money bio-tech firms and the race to patent gene sequences. I felt that the book dragged on as it delved into the public debates on the role of genetic engineering in society, but to each his own.

My sole reason for writing this review is to alert the reader trying to decide whether to read this book that it is out of date - this book needs a new chapter since it has become clear that the so-called central dogma is not exactly right(i.e., the notion that one gene encodes, via mRNA, one protein) - if you are reading this book as a primer on how DNA works you'll be getting an incomplete and incorrect perspective. For that you'll need to follow the book with some articles that will bring you more up to date: Mattick, John S., The Hidden Genetic Program of Complex Organisms (Scientific American 2004) and Ast, Gil, The Alternative Genome (Scientific American 2005). I'm sure there are others more recent, but that's as far as I've gotten.

That's right I don't like it.
The first one "" The Double Helix"" I didn't like either but I was trying to be a nice guy.
But I don't care this time. The book?......why should I like it?
Because this guy got a Nobel Prize?......no sorry can't go with that reasoning.

First off, Physicists, like this guy puts it on page XX of his introduction, ""can only deal with small numbers of interactive particles because according to this guy if the number of these particles gets too big then physicists just walk away from the problem because ""they think"" as he says that they think biological problems are ""too big"".........

sorry that's not a fact....it's just the opposite.....in fact.

oh really?...how about 10 to the power of 23....???

Ever heard the term ""Statisitcal Mechanics""????

Then he says that ""Life is Chemistry""....because DNA is chemistry or ...okay....but what is Chemistry anyway???.....like maybe Physics????
He keeps saying that he and Crick "" solved the problem of Life""....okay so where's Crick right now?....where are a lot of those Nobel Laureates right now?
Nobel prize what????

Also he ( or his ghost writer) misqotes Schrodinger on p.35....where he says""..He even speculated that understanding life.....might take us beyond the laws of physics as we understood them.""
right but in my copy of ""What is Life"" on p.47...under the heading...""Explicable by Quantum Theory""...Schrodinger writes...""the mechanism of heredity is closely related to, nay, founded on the very basis of Quantum Theory.""....now what's going on?.....

then we get a lesson in ""Eugenics""....and even we get the name ""Hitler"".....is that even scholarship?...to mention Hitler?....as if this Hitler was a significant benchmark is science?....in Political Science yes I can understand.....in Pschyopathology......yes an even better topic....but do I want to associate genetics with a name like that???

Bertrand Russell hated Dewey....at least not personally but hated his thinking.
Dewey would say that the truth is ""what we all agree on""....that is if we agree on some issue then that is the truth....well this book to me reminds me of just that.

What is the truth about DNA?

You won't find it in this book....I looked. ( well there's a few facts but...not the cure)

This is just like the Roman Catholic Church in the time of Galileo.....it's all about authority....whose authority???...well the status quo....et al.....not about science........science is testing....not opinion....

The Church didn't want to look bad....so they ""did it"" to Galileo.
And the establishment has been ""doing it"" to scientists ever since.
Like for example the ""MIB""....( Men In Black )....don't really look for Aliens like in the movie.....they ""hunt"" ""heads""...genius's, computer hackers, virus builders, Nuclear Device people..you name it....perhaps some of it is justified...okay...but they'll tail you 24/7 nevertheless if they think you've got something big.

Allan M. Lees,4.0 out of 5 stars,In the Beginning Was the Worm:  Finding the Secrets of Life in a Tiny Hermaphrodite,Genetics from Small Beginnings,"Why do we grow old and die? Amazingly, after more than forty years of research, we still don't know the answers. This book charts the history of one branch of investigation into this thorny problem and does it with verve, style, and wit. In addition it is written with an admirable clarity that will enable non-specialists to grasp not only what was going on during the 30 years people have been studying c. elegans but also why it matters.

The main omission of the book concerns the fact that unlike complex eukaryotes such as reptiles and mammals our small wormy friend does not undergo cell division. Therefore cell-division-related loss-of-information theories about senescence clearly cannot explain why c. elegans lasts less than a month even under ideal conditions. In principle the fact that this non-dividing cellular system actually does grow old and die should teach us something very important about the mechanisms of aging, but alas we are little closer to understanding why these tiny creatures age than we were when the whole enterprise started with Brenner's initial investigations. It would presumably be very illuminating to contrast the all-too-mortal worm with immortal cancer cell lines; somewhere in there are surely the clues we need to get a better understanding of what it means to age.

But this book is a nice primer on the basic issues involved in the study of aging and as such is a welcome addition to the bookshelf.",2
Zac,3.0 out of 5 stars,Protein Bioinformatics: An Algorithmic Approach to Sequence and Structure Analysis,Good introduction for undergraduates or as reference.,"The book 'Protein Bioinformatics' tries to cover all aspects of proteins, from sequence to structure. This is of course a very wide field and the difficulty of the algorithms involved in this analysis increases from sequence to structure investigations. From the preface of the book one can read, that this is still not enough for the authors because additionally they are trying to write this book for a broad audience, for researchers and students.

After reading this book I think it could be used by undergraduate students in Bioinformatics or related fields or as reference. It does not give deep and clear explanations but rather provides short summaries of articles. The good thing is after reading this book you know of the existence of these articles and can consult them to understand the working mechanism of the algorithms in detail.

There is certainly a lack in good books about proteins and especially about protein structure analysis which can partly filled by this book.",2
wiredweird,4.0 out of 5 stars,Protein Bioinformatics: An Algorithmic Approach to Sequence and Structure Analysis,"Good intro, but light presentation","This book gives good, basic coverage of the concepts important in understanding protein sequence and structure.

There are three major sections in this book: sequence, structure, and the relatinship between the two. The sequence section covers all the basics: dynamic programming for string matching, scoring matrices, trees and classification, and profiles of various sorts. The sequence discussion is a bit shorter, but goes over substructures, similarity searching and scoring, and kinds of structures and domains. The third section is even shorter and unites the two areas: predicting structure from sequence, with a good introduction to threading.

The book's strength is its breadth. It sacrifices depth to get that breadth, though. A few analytic techniques are sketched in the text or presented in psuedocode. Most often, however, a programmer will have a hard time gleaning enough detail from this to implement any of the algorithms described.

The authors aim at readers who already understand the significance of protein structure and who are comfortable with ideas like hydrogen bonding. Lots of programmers will have a hard time understanding why problems are important or what the driving phenomena are. Biologists won't be put off by an excessively mathematical treatment, but won't get a detailed understanding of the algorithms or mathematical foundations either. This book comes close to under-serving both kinds of reader.

This book is good for conceptual understanding of the algorithms, where implementable details don't matter, and gives good coverage to protein-specific issues. It's decidedly for someone who wants more than just the how-to of running BLAST or strucuture analysis tools. I think this book will help most if you want more understanding of what goes on inside the tools, or if you want an easy start to a deep and complex topic. Advanced readers may not like it, though - detail and real understanding just aren't there. I give this one four stars, but I had to round up to four.

Tim Yates,3.0 out of 5 stars,BioInformatics: A Computing Perspective,"Decent introduction, but needs work","Overall, this book serves as a decent springboard into further exploration of topics in bioinformatics. It gives a broad sampling of the terms and basic techniques in the field, making the reader conversant enough to research the details elsewhere. This level of involvement is probably the best approach for an emerging field like bioinformatics, where the rules of the game are hardly written down before they change again.

On the other hand, I had several issues with this book. For one, it seemed like a rough draft in many places. In addition to some copyediting issues and stylistic inconsistencies, a few of the illustrations were poorly constructed and unclear.

The book aims (according to the back cover) to be a ""standalone text"" focusing on the computing side of bioinformatics, but with relevant background in biology and mathematics. Though it handled computing, math, and statistics fairly well, I felt that the biology side of the material was lacking, and sometimes even off the mark. The authors have a tendency to make analogies to computing whenever they try to explain a biological process. This is not necessarily a bad idea, but they often spend too much time on the analogies rather than the actual explanation, confusing the issue by bogging down the reader in the parts that did not correspond. My recommendation: more (and better) illustrations, and fewer analogies.

Even the computing part had some problems. The exercises were all over the place. Some were trivial and had tenuous relevance (""decode this Morse code message using a table""), while others were large programming projects with latent, difficult graph theory problems. Meanwhile, a few code listings demonstrated horrible programming practices (a state machine implemented with recursive function calls, anyone?). Moreover, they were all written in Java, which is fine in itself--choose a language and stick with it--but the text sometimes referred to Java idiosyncrasies that made discussions inapplicable to other languages.

I do not want to make this book sound worthless. It had many good qualities, and it was certainly valuable as a starting point. Still, I think the authors and the publisher need to consider some major revisions to many of its sections. I hope that there will be further editions that address some of these issues: the book has lots of potential that is mired by its rough edges.",4
George Fink,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Genome Generation,The Genome Generation (or Revolution),"Elizabeth Finkel's personal account of the decoding of the human genome and its impact on Man and society is as gripping and exciting as the story on which it is based. Even the grizzled, gruff sceptic ""skilled in the art"" will find the work a page-turner. Written in clear flowing narrative peppered with anecdotes and vignettes, the book will be enjoyed by scientists and laypersons alike. Highlights include the clear explanation of junk DNA, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their relevance for between-individual variation and disease, haplotypes, HIV and AIDS, and the ""Green Revolution"" that has challenged the Malthusian hypothesis that humans will out-populate their food resources. ""The Genome Generation"" gains piquancy from the fact that Finkel has interviewed many of the key players...and is not shy in admitting their personal attractiveness. Thus, she refers to the attractive Eurasian features of Paul de Bakker...and re her first interview with Green Revolution leader Norman Borlaug states ""Borlaug fixed a pair of keen, blue eyes on me"". Notwithstanding the excitement of the genetic and genomic revolution, Elizabeth Finkel's account is balanced and where appropriate reserved. Thus, for example, while dealing at length with the relevance of epigenetics for the possible reinstatement of Lamarckian evolution...she applies the brakes on full acceptance of Lamarck, at least for now. Attractive though Lamarck's hypothesis is for the transgenerational transmission of acquired characteristics, more data are required.

The first chapter gives a whirl-wind tour of genetics and sets the scene. Finkel takes a number of new and sometimes contentious theories, such as junk DNA and 'Lamarkism' (epigenetics), and shows how they might help to solve real world problems, such as AIDS and global food security.

You only need to know little high school calculus and some algebra.

The idea of the book is to teach algorithms that are useful for real bioinformatic applications, with the hope that you will be creating you own algorithms or applications in the future. Is not a book to learn BioPython (the preface clearly states that and explains why the skills learned in this book an BioPython could be used in a complementary fashion).

The book uses Python 2, not Python 3. This is not a drawback as some people want to think, Python 2 is going to be the ""standard"" python for at least few year more and many (but not all) of the features of Python 3 are already present in Python 2.7. Even more important the book relies heavily in the NumPy library (as almost all scientific python programming) and NumPy is not, yet, compatible with Python 3, hence using Python 3 in a book like this will be, at least, non-sense.

The only problem is that sometimes with some topics the author does not take too much time to explain the applications of some ideas, for example in the chapter on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) the Author just explain how to program different HMM implementations. Probably this is a mismatch between my background and the author's (I am closer to the a structural-biologist/biophysics) and some concepts are not used in the exactly same way in different scientific branchs, nothing that not can be solved by reading a Wikipedia entry.

I was a little disappointed that this book merely references biopython, and doesn't utilize it or show people how to use it. Why not use the tools that are available? In a classroom setting, I guess I can understand why you would want students to learn from the ground up, but this book is essentially teaching people Python in a bioinformatics way. For example, why does the book show how to parse fasta files in Chapter 6. This is merely a lesson in file parsing - something you should know if you understand Python, and why show it if biopython already does this for you.

Using genetic data, he raises questions about the extent to which intelligent design or non-intelligent design reigns. He notes the messiness of the genome and the many defects associated with it. He attempts to demonstrate how natural selection can readily explain the genome.

A reasoned argument, and it is made reasonably. Unlike Dawkins, he does not spend a great deal of time criticizing religion. And that is to the good, in my view. Still, proponents of Intelligent Design are unlikely to change their views as they read this book. But it is accessible to nonscientific readers and will prove a useful resource to understand the genome.",1
John H. Terrell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Inside the Human Genome: A Case for Non-Intelligent Design,"Avise's ""The Iliad and Theodicy""","Avise, a Distinguished Professor of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at UC Davis, holds a PhD in Genetics, has written 20 books, and has authored/coauthored more than 300 scientific articles in his field.

He wastes no time and minces no words. From the very first paragraphs of his Preface, he challenges the basic premise of Intelligent Design. He says: ""...explaining biological systems that are complex and function well is easy, at a cursory level."" [but] ""The greater conceptual challenge--for scientists and ID proponents alike--is to explain complex biological traits that show profound structural or functional flaws."" [and] ""Flawed biotic features nonetheless abound in species, including humans."" Avise posits that while the original design may have been intelligent, subsequent flaws reflect implementations that are far from intelligent and are accordingly more reasonably attributed to evolution's non-sentient design.

ID rejects macro-evolution, thus requires special creations, which brings the issue of theodicy to the fore, placing on God the entire responsibility for all the suffering caused by design and implementation flaws. But by attributing genetic flaws to evolution's less than perfect implementations, God is placed at least one remove from responsibility for them.

In Chapter 1 Avise fleshes out his thesis that an error-riddled genome, as implemented, does not reflect intelligent design: implementation by evolution does, and evolution lessens the burden of theodicy.

In Chapters 2-4, Avise supports his contention that flawed biotic features abound. He notes the many inborn errors of metabolism that take countless lives, gratuitous genomic complexities that routinely compromise human health, byzantine mechanisms of gene regulation, and much more - and all these imperfections are consistent with evolutionary expectations, not intelligent design. While he describes only a few representative genomic flaws, he does provides numerous tables categorizing and enumerating many more, and cites other documents that describe yet more, such as the ""Human Genome Mutation Database"", which as of 2010 describes more than 100,000 mutations!

In Chapter 5 Avise details his argument from imperfection. Since his argument is based on microbiological data, he chooses, appropriately, to challenge Behe: ""I will use Behe's 1996 treatise [Darwin's Black Box] as a touchstone for discussion because it remains the preeminent book-length endorsement of Intelligent Design from a professional molecular biologist.""

Point by point, Avise shows evolution's non-sentient design is far superior to ID's special creations in explaining the diversity of life on earth. Behe was aware that there are ""apparent"" molecular imperfections, but tried to deflect an argument from imperfection on the basis that we can't know the mind of the designer and whether he would consider them imperfections. Avise notes: `Ironically, Behe's dismissal of the argument from imperfection in effect demolishes Intelligent Design as a testable scientific hypothesis...""

Regarding special-creations Avise says: ""When fine details of molecular errors appear in phylogenetically related species, special-creation explanations for such errors are thus effectively eliminated (unless we suppose that a bumbling Creator made the same molecular mistakes time and again when directly forging different species).""

Avise finishes with a brief epilogue - essentially an apologetic for science.

In summary, the preceding is just a taste: Avise delivers much, much more. He provides a passionate defense of science in general and evolution theory in particular. In the process, he demonstrates that ID is without scientific merit and is of questionable religious merit, being unsupportive of religion relative to theodicy.",6

Darwin Researcher,3.0 out of 5 stars,Inside the Human Genome: A Case for Non-Intelligent Design,"An excellent, very readable easy to follow review of the genome..","Inside the Human Genome: A Case for Non-Intelligent Design by professor John C. Avise is an excellent, very readable and easy to follow review of the complex design of the human genome. The author argues that among the reasons that exist to support the view that the human genome was not designed is because it is enormously complex. This is a problem, he writes, because, the more complex something is, the more likely it is that something will go wrong. He argues that, if the genome was designed, it would be much simpler and thus it would be less likely that things could to go wrong. The Krebs cycle, which every graduate biochemistry student is very familiar with, is only one example of the 2,766 documented metabolites and 3,311 metabolic and transport reactions in human cells, and many more no doubt exist. He lists a few of the many diseases that result from genetic errors (pp. 62-63) to illustrate his premise. Another argument he used is the fact that, as far as we know, all genes in eukaryotes contain introns, gene sequences that are spliced out before the gene is used as a template to produce protein. All total, of the protein specifying genes, 97 percent of the base pairs consists of introns. The diseases caused by errors of splicing the introns out to produce the mRNA transcript genes are processed include ALS and many others (p. 76-77). He then lists the various evolutionary theories for their origin, all of which are problematic. As research has progressed we now realize that these introns serve a variety of functions, including regulation and the advantage of isoforms because certain introns may or may not be spliced out, allowing one gene transcript to produce many different proteins. Actually, as he notes, 75 percent of the protein-coding genes express alternatively spliced variants. He claims that it would be simpler to just have 200,000 genes that to use isoforms. The problem with this is the fact that we are just beginning to understand the genome and how it functions. The reason for the splicing system is regulation which could net be achieved by a lot more genes because genes function as sets, and the existing system allows this very effectively. He also ignores the fact that most mutations are caused by mutagens, not flawed design. Evidence of this included the fact that cancer rates varies enormously according to the environment. Some of the arguments Avise uses have already been proven wrong, such as the claim that 97 or some similar number of base pairs is junk, a view the ENCODE project has largely laid to rest. The many illustrations also are very helpful.",1
Saganite,3.0 out of 5 stars,Inside the Human Genome: A Case for Non-Intelligent Design,Much-needed book; appreciated brevity; but very difficult for non-specialists.,"Some material is irreducibly complex. I mean in genetics. There is only so far that an author can go in simplifying the material for a non-scientist like me before she ends up not even saying things that are accurate any more. So I sympathize with Avise's challenge in writing a book like this, but...I found some of his efforts to be more ""popular"" in his tone sort of amusing. I mean, he says that he is trying to produce a work for a ""broad audience."" Effort noted and appreciated, but then the next couple of chapters had between them perhaps four or five paragraphs that I could follow fully. And sometime's Avise helpfully provides a definition for a term that might not be familiar to the reader (ironically, it was more often than not these terms that I WAS familiar with...so perhaps one of his guiding principles was only to define the terms that were essential to an understanding of the overall subject matter even if in the context of other less-well-understood terms), followed by an onslaught of three or four paragraphs in a row of genetic arcana that I find it very hard to believe anyone without a solid grounding in genetics could follow.

Having said all that, I still think the book is valuable and I think it's compelling...even kind of fun in its way, because the genome and its workings are such a freak show. The chapters where Avise comes up for air and makes pronouncements on what we've just read are lucid and cogent. Avise plays painfully fair with theism, but I do wish he could have followed Jerry Coyne's example in ""Why Evolution is True"" and just not addressed much of the theistic stuff at all. It's not necessary to make some sort of atheistic rant or to try to make up some soothing excuses for theism either one. The science speaks for itself, quite loudly, and any dispassionate examination of the evidence can only lead one to conclude that an all-powerful, all-good being cannot be behind the human genome. As Avise says in the section on mitochondria, not only is the design of it suboptimal, it is ludicrous. 'Nuff said, frankly. Efforts at reconciliation with religion seem necessarily hollow once the truth of that sinks in.

There are other books that walk a similar path and are much easier to read. I'm thinking especially of Survival of the Sickest: A Medical Maverick Discovers Why We Need Disease, which has an interesting take on, for example, malaria. But for sophisticated, scientifically credible material one could use to counter the work of, for example, some recent books that try to make the claim that Intelligent Design is evident in DNA, ""Inside"" is invaluable. Not light reading, mind you, but invaluable.",17
Wayne Robinson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Inside the Human Genome: A Case for Non-Intelligent Design,A timely reminder that Evolution still rules supreme.,"Published on February 12, 2010, presumably in celebration of the 201st anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin, ""Inside the Human Genome: A Case for Non-Intelligent Design"" is yet another book convincingly pointing out that the ""modern"" Creationist theory of Intelligent Design has no explanatory or predictive power, and therefore fails.

I don't recommend the Kindle edition though. The formatting of the tables and illustrations is very poor, and almost completely unreadable, and after a while I gave up on them. The text is very clear though. It would have been better if it had been formatted for the larger screen of the Kindle DX or the Kindle computer version.

Instead of examining biological structures that work very well and are very beautiful, John Avise examines plain ugly and barely functional elements of ID's latest poster child, DNA. He shows that DNA looks exactly the way it should, after a long process of evolution and tinkering, and not the masterwork of a loving and caring Intelligent Designer.

It's often forgotten, that for all its design faults, the vertebrate eye still works extremely well. Both Intelligent Design and Evolution have little trouble in explaining perfection or almost perfection.

John Avise, in less than 240 pages (in the Kindle version, the main text finishes 72% through the book before the ""Notes and References""), discusses exhaustively the many design faults of the human genome. I'm not certain for whom this book is written. Certainly not the common run-of-the mill ID proponent who waxes enthusiastically over Stephen Meyer's 600+ page ""Signature in the Cell"". The information is presented in a very dense form, fact after fact, almost without respite.

To give two examples John Avise uses. In malarial areas, sickle cell trait provides increased resistance to malaria. Individuals are heterozygous for Haemoglobin S, a variant form of Haemoglobin A, and have a survival advantage. Individuals with sickle cell anaemia, homozygous for HbS, have a nasty and short life. They pay the price for the increased survival of heterozygotes, and the die is cast at conception. Hardly the deed of a loving and caring Intelligent Designer. So, the malarial parasite is intelligently designed, and the stop-gap measure of sickle cell trait is also intelligently designed, or at least according to ID.

He also discusses my favourite example of bad design, the mitochondrial genome. Mitochondria were originally symbiotic bacteria, and as such had a complete bacterial genome. Most of the mitochondrial genes have been moved out of harm's way to the nucleus, but the mitochondria still retains a circular bacterial chromosome, with a small number of genes, including 13 genes for components of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. In mitochondria, exposed to free radicals of oxygen, they mutate at 5 to 10 times the rate of nuclear genes, so the end result is steadily decreasing energy production with ageing, and ""brownouts"" followed by ""blackouts"", and death.

The human genome contains 3 billion base pairs. Most of it is definitely ""junk"", without function. ID proponents have faith that all of it will eventually be found to have a function, but they are certain to be disappointed. Almost all genes consist of alternating exons (which code for the protein product) and introns (which don't). The trouble is, is that the the non-coding introns are 30 times as long as the coding exons. So the cell has to take a lot of effort transcribing a much larger mRNA molecule than necessary, and then has to expend a lot more effort splicing the non-coding RNA out to get a functional mRNA molecule. Not very efficient, and very wasteful. Bacteria have a much more efficient genome (actually, I wonder, does the Intelligent Designer love bacteria more than us?)

Towards the end, the author points out that Darwin liberated both science and theology with ""Origin of the Species"". No longer do religious people have to try to explain the theodicy of genetic defects, as the action of a loving and caring Creator.

The author finishes, with a re-writing of Darwin's famous conclusion to ""Origin""; ""... There is grandeur in this view of the genome, with its several powers, having perhaps been originally breathed by the Creator into one or a few primordial molecular forms; and ... from so simple a beginning most beautiful, sometimes most awful, but always wondrous genomic features have been, and are being evolved"".

I think I still prefer the original, which still excites me whenever I hear it.",30

This is a very honourable goal. Unfortunatelly, it fails. An indicator for this can already be seen in the low number of pages. This book has less than 140 pages (I exclude the last chapter and the appendix). It is clear, that it is impossible to discuss in detail this topic in this limited number of pages. Hence, during reading the chapters one gets the feeling, that one reads short essays which are stringed together. At no point the authors go into detail but give only a short idea and references.

I see no reason, why I should recommend this book to anyone. It is in its current form just immature. My prediction: There will be no second edition because even its basic substance is very weak.

Some words to the last chapter (systems biology). This is indeed the most interesting and best chapter of the book (35 pages) without going into details as the rest of the book.

If you do not know any biology at all you probably should also get a basic text on genetics/molecular biology (or read thema at the NCBI web site books section for free). You don't need anything in depth to read the dummies book, just at the level of an introductory biology book. Hint: DNA to RNA, RNA to Protein. And you want to know why proteins are similar because proteins with similar amino acid sequences often have similar chemical properties and therefore similar functions, so if you know what one protein does you can guess what a protein like it probably does.

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hidden Markov Models for Bioinformatics (Computational Biology),Primarily for bio-mathematicians,"The field of computational biology has expanded greatly in the last decade, mainly due to the increasing role of bioinformatics in the genome sequencing projects. This book outlines a particular set of algorithms called hidden Markov models, that are used frequently in genetic sequence search routines. The book is primarily for mathematicians who want to move into bioinformatics, but it could be read by a biologist who has a strong mathematical background. The book is detailed at some places, sparse in others, and reads like a literature survey at times, but many references are given, and there are very interesting exercises at the end of each chapter section. In fact it is really imperative that the reader work some of these exercises, as the author proves some of the results in the main body of the text via the exercises.
Some of the highlights of the book include: 1. An overview of the probability theory to be used in the book. The material is fairly standard, including a review of continuous and discrete random variables, from the measure-theoretic point of view, i.e the author introduces them via a probability space which is set with its sigma field, and a probability measure on this field. The weight matrix or ""profile"" as it is sometimes called, is defined, this having many applications in bioinformatics. Bayesian learning is also discussed, and the author introduces what he calls the ""missing information principle"", and is fundamental to the probabilistic modeling of biological sequences. Applications of probability theory to DNA analysis are discussed, including shotgun assembly and the distribution of fragment lengths from restriction digests. A collection of interesting exercises is included at the end of the chapter, particularly the one on the null model for pairwise alignments. 2. An introduction to information theory and the relative entropy or ""Kullback distance"", the latter of which is used to learn sequence models from data. The author defines the mutual information between two probability distributions and the entropy, and calculates the latter for random DNA. He also proves some of the Shannon source coding theorems, one being the convergence to the entropy for independent, identically distributed random variables. The Kullback distance is then defined, as a distance between probability distributions, with the caution that it is not a metric because of lack of symmetry. 3. The overview of probabilistic learning theory, where 'learning from data' is defined as the process of inferring a general principle from observations of instances. 4. The very detailed treatment of the EM algorithm, including the discussion of a model for fragments with motifs. 5. The discussion of alignment and scoring, especially that of global similarity. Local alignment is treated in the exercises. 6. The discussion of the learning of Markov chains via Bayesian modeling applied to a training sequence via a family of Markov models. Frame dependent Markov chains are discussed in the context of Markovian models for DNA sequences. 7. The discussion of influence diagrams and nonstandard hidden Markov models, in particular the excellent diagrams drawn to illustrate the main properties, and excellent discussion is given of an ""HMM with duration"" in the context of the functional units of a eukaryotic gene. This is important in the GeneMark:hmm software available. 8. The treatment of motif-based HMM, in particular the discussion of the approximate common substring problem. 9. The discussion of the ""quasi-stationary"" property of some chains and the connection with the ""Yaglom limit"". 10. The treatment of Derin's formula for the smoothing posterior probability of a standard HMM. The author shows in detail that the probability of a finite length emitted sequence conditioned on a state sequence of the HMM depends only on a subsequence of the state sequence. 11. The treatment of the lumping of Markov chains, i.e. the question as to whether a function of a Markov chain is another Markov chain. 12. The very detailed treatment of the Forward-Backward algorithm and the Viterbi algorithm. 13. The discussion of the learning problem via the quasi-log likelihood function for HMM. 14. The discussion of the limit points for the Baum-Welch algorithm. Since the Baum-Welch algorithm deals with iterations of a map, its convergence can be proved by finding the fixed points of this map. These fixed points are in fact the stationary points of the likelihood function and can be related to the convergence of the algorithm via the Zangwill theory of algorithms. Unfortunately the author does not give the details of the Zangwill theory, but instead delegates it to the references (via an exercise). The Zangwill theory can be discussed in the context of nonlinear programming, with generalizations of it occurring in the field of nonlinear functional analysis. It might be interesting to investigate whether the properties of hidden Markov models, especially their rigorous statistical properties, can all be discussed in the context of nonlinear functional analysis.",8

""Biological Information: New Perspectives"" is one of the books that I have purchased in order to get my questions answered and to discover the truth about biology and the controversies associated with it.

This is another book that I can add to my defense arsenal to protect me against the vicious attacks of the Atheistic Darwinists.

Add the book ""Genetic Entropy"" by John C. Sanford into the mix, and you will have a good start towards discovering what cutting-edge Biological Research is all about! Or, you can continue to read Richard Dawkins' books which are based completely upon the Biological Sciences that we had 40 years ago! Richard Dawkins hasn't done any scientific research for over 40 years. Richard Dawkins is at least half a century behind the times when it comes to his scientific knowledge. In my humble opinion, you want the PhDs doing the cutting-edge scientific research here and now as your teachers and your guides, and NOT Richard Dawkins' fifty-year-old regurgitated tripe.

Answering Questions:

I was mocked for suggesting that almost everything that you see around you is a LIVING FOSSIL (20 of the 23 major phyla that exist today and that you can see around you were planted fully formed with NO evolutionary precursors during the Cambrian Explosion) -- the person called me an idiot and told me that there were no bunnies in the Cambrian Explosion.

My Response:

It can actually be a very fun and interesting exercise to determine which of the phyla were here BEFORE the Cambrian Explosion (2 or so), which of the phyla came during the Cambrian Explosion and eventually went extinct (at least 16 and certainly more), which phyla came during the Cambrian Explosion and have remained unchanged ever since and are currently LIVING FOSSILS (at least 20 and certainly more), and which phyla came AFTER the Cambrian Explosion in the Devonian Explosion (2 phyla) and other explosions that took place when the Gods planted additional phyla onto this earth.

The mammals are one of the last phyla that the Gods planted onto this earth, so no Virginia, you will not find any cute bunnies during the Cambrian Explosion. The Gods were busy preparing this earth for man, their offspring, during the Cambrian and Devonian Explosions.

When it comes to this subject, you have to choose to use your brains and not let your ignorance blind you.

Each phylum (or major animal group) comes onto the scene instantaneously with NO evolutionary precursors, fully developed and fully formed, and it remains basically the same with only minor speciation for millions of years until it finally goes extinct. That's what the fossil record tells us.

When we have all gone extinct, the Gods will have to come and plant the place once again, if they want to. The WHOLE THING is moving towards extinction thanks to Evolution and Random Mutations! There is NO forward evolution taking place -- no forward evolution caused by Natural Selection and Random Mutations. That is the message of the Cambrian and the Devonian Explosions! Natural Selection and Random Mutations CANNOT produce forward evolution. Random Mutations can only accelerate our extinction.

You want to use your brains when it comes to this subject.

The Official Motto of the Evolutionists and Atheists: Kill the messenger to hide your ignorance.

A person asked something to this effect: ""If all of the evolutionists are liars, then where does Meyer, Sanford, Rana, Wells, Sarfati, and the hundreds of other honest PhDs and scientists get their data?""

My Response:

They get their scientific data and scientific evidence from the former Atheists, Evolutionists, and Darwinists who are NOT liars and cheats.

Actually, Biology Scientists and Biology PhDs like John C. Sanford, Fazale Rana, Jonathan Wells, and Michael Denton get their scientific data from doing actual scientific research of their own! Stephen Meyer tends to get his scientific data from them.

I still think that Michael Denton IS an atheist -- but he was a research biologist in micro-biology when he wrote his first book exposing the flaws in the theory of evolution. Michael Denton was just an honest atheist and an honest scientist. John C. Sanford started as an atheist and an evolutionist, but decades of actual scientific research taught him that the Theory of Evolution is fundamentally flawed. John Sanford created the gene gun and genetic engineering, and John Sanford retired off the funds he got when he sold his two biotech companies. Johathan Wells was an evolutionist and a Darwinist until his PhD graduate program in Embryology, when he discovered that the Evolutionists have been lying to us for the past 150 years. His teaching professors admitted that they knew about the lies, but still used the lies in their classrooms to preach Evolution. Jonathan Wells had a choice -- to either join with them or to expose the truth. He chose to expose the truth. Fazale Rana was and is a biology researcher doing real actual science in the field.

What Meyer does is to hire Biology Scientists and then instructs them to find the truth. That's where Meyer gets his data from.

It's not magic. It's common sense.

Once you divorce your emotions from your religion, The Theory of Evolution, you will suddenly see that it is so.

That's what happened to me. I used to be an atheist until I saw the light and the truth.

The Official Motto of the Evolutionists and Atheists: Kill the messenger to hide your ignorance.

Some of the Atheists and Evolutionists that I encountered online were doing brutal mockery, libel, slander, and denigration of John C. Sanford, Michael Denton, Stephen Meyer, Jonathan Wells, Gerald Shroeder, Hugh Ross, Fazale Rana, Jonathan Sarfati, and many other scientists and PhDs.

The Atheists and Evolutionists can’t kill the Intelligent Design message and can’t debunk the Intelligent Design message, so they have to try to kill and destroy the messenger, which they attempt to do over and over again until it gets extremely pointless and old. The Atheists and Evolutionists and Darwinists engage in smear campaigns against their opponents in an attempt to hide their own ignorance. It’s deflection of the most petty and worthless kind. It’s infantile and puerile. But, it’s what they do. They really have no choice, because the scientific evidence itself has turned against them! The Evolutionists and Atheists can’t win on the merits of the case, so they have to kill the messengers to hide their ignorance and to try to hide the fact that they have already lost.

The Atheists and Evolutionists and Darwinists engage in smear campaigns because they have something that they are trying to hide from the rest of us. They have been deliberately and knowingly lying to us for the past 150 years. That definitely gives them something to hide!

It’s no mystery that I have lost respect for them.

The other day, I had an atheistic youngster trying to use some Atheism 101 on me -- name-calling, splitting hairs, deception, sleight-of-hand, bigotry, and selective amnesia. The Atheists and Darwinists try to get you staring at gnats in the hope that you will somehow swallow the camel whole -- the ""camel"" being the falsehoods associated with the Theory of Evolution.

This atheistic youngster thought that he had found the smoking gun when he discovered that Jonathan Wells was a theologian BEFORE Jonathan Wells discovered the falsehoods associated with the Theory of Evolution, as if being a theologian magically makes a person incapable of seeing and understanding the truths and falsehoods within Science. The Atheists and Darwinists believe in a lot of magic and mythology with a blind faith that rivals and at times exceeds the blind faith of Religious Fanatics. Extremism of any kind, whether it's Radical Fundamentalism or Militant Atheism, is dangerous and harmful to society.

This atheistic youngster got a few of his facts wrong and exposed his ignorance once again while doing so.

The greatest Scientists I know are theologians, and many of them became theologians AFTER their Scientific Research started pointing them to God. But, in Jonathan Wells' case, as discussed in his autobiography at the start of his book, ""Icons of Evolution"", he was a theologian BEFORE he discovered that the Darwinists have been lying to us for the past 150 years. So, what's wrong with that? Nothing!

So, sit back and let this old man tell you how things used to be back in the day.

Thirty-five years ago, BEFORE the microbiologists doing cutting-edge scientific research proved the Theory of Evolution false, we ALL were evolutionists, or at least had to pretend to be if we wanted to pass our college exams. Back in 1980, I asked my Biology Professor, a Christian, about the Theory of Evolution. He told me that it was true and that I had to believe in it, because there was no other explanation for the scientific evidence. And, back in 1980, he was right. The microbiologists, such as Michael Denton, didn't start to prove the Theory of Evolution false until the mid-1980's. I was ten years too early with my questions. Back then, we ALL were evolutionists and Darwinists. We had no choice. Yes, some of the people around me were Theistic Evolutionists or Evolutionistic Theologians, but they were still evolutionists! We had to be, because there wasn't anything better at the time.

A Theistic Evolutionist believes that GOD used evolution, through natural selection and random mutations, to create the life forms on this planet.

Now, if my atheistic youngster friend will read Jonathan Wells' biography a bit more carefully, he will notice that Jonathan Wells was a Theistic Evolutionist, a theologian AND a believer in Darwinism and evolution, BEFORE his Phd program in Embryology where he discovered that the Atheistic Darwinists have been lying to us for the past 150 years.

It doesn't really matter whether Jonathan Wells was, or was not, a theologian before he discovered the falsehoods of the Theory of Evolution. All that really matters is that he finally discovered the truth!

In my case, and in the case of Lee Strobel, Antony Flew, Edward Feser, John C. Sanford, and hundreds of other scientists, WE were atheists before we discovered that the Darwinists and Atheists have been lying to us for the past 150 years. We were Atheistic Evolutionists, which is the exact same thing as being a Theistic Evolutionist, because every Evolutionist has been successfully tricked and deceived by the Darwinists into believing that the Theory of Evolution is true.

This same atheistic youngster asked me to show him one deception or lie that the Atheistic Darwinists perpetrated against us. I pointed him to ""Icons of Evolution"" by Jonathan Wells, because it contains at least a dozen.

The study of Science is a learning process, or at least it should be.

I have discovered dozens of different books in which the lies of the Atheistic Darwinists and Atheistic Materialists are successfully exposed for all the world to see.

""The Unofficial Guide to Cosmos: Fact and Fiction in Neil deGrasse Tyson's Landmark Science Series"" by David Klinghoffer is one such book.

""Debating Darwin's Doubt: A Scientific Controversy That Can No Longer Be Denied"" by David Klinghoffer is another.

""Total Truth (Study Guide Edition - Trade Paperback): Liberating Christianity from Its Cultural Captivity"" by Nancy Pearcey exposes the lies of Evolution while revealing the truth to you.

""Biological Information: New Perspectives"" IS a massive science book containing peer-reviewed science articles from 29 PhD scientists, which expose the lies and inadequacies found in the Theory of Evolution.

""Genetic Entropy"" by John C. Sanford is an excellent book that explains very clearly and in simple terms how Natural Selection and Random Mutations are totally inadequate when it comes time to produce NEW biologial information, new genes, new biological designs, new genomes, and new life forms. Science itself has proven that Natural Selection and Random Mutations are not sufficient to the task of creating whole new life forms, not even from the existing life forms that God has already created for us. It requires an Intelligent Genetic Engineer to do such a thing; and, that is Artificial Selection or Man-Made Selection and NOT Natural Selection. Random Mutations can't guide or build anything! The ONLY thing that Random Mutations can do is to slowly guide us towards our eventual extinction, because Random Mutations cause genetic degredation!

""Evolution: A Theory in Crisis"" by Michael Denton was the first Science Book to successfully expose me to the falsehoods in the Theory of Evolution; but unfortunately for me, it wasn't until 1996 that I first read the book, and it was the ONLY book of its kind that I could find at the time. So, I remained an evolutionist, just as Michael Denton remained an evolutionist -- although by that point in time, I was starting to question the Theory of Evolution, just as he was.

""Icons of Evoluton"" by Jonathan Wells should really have been called, ""The Lies of Evolution"", because that is what that book exposes for public scrutiny.

There are literally dozens of different books now that expose the lies and deceptions of the Atheistic Darwinists. You just have to be willing to look for them, find them, and read them. The truth is out there now!",4

Critical thought,4.0 out of 5 stars,Biological Information: New Perspectives,Very deep and wide,"I’d give it five stars for its scholarship and content, except it’s not for all audiences. It would be very easy for most people not to understand it.

It makes a good case that biological life is not only matter plus energy, rather that information is at the heart of biological life, just as much as matter and energy. One of the aspects of information is its unpredictability from natural causes. For example, the traces left by the Great Bonneville Flood require no information for explanation despite the fact that its length and size left a rather complex record, everything can be explained from just matter and energy, but even the simplest of living organisms have a type of complexity that makes it unpredictable from natural causes, so unpredictable that the probability is virtually nil from natural causes.

This is a scholarly symposium with such high scholarship that even education people have trouble understanding it, and for that reason would not be recommended for all audiences.",9

2. ""The Membrane Code: A Carrier of Essential Biological Information That Is Not Specified by DNA and Is Inherited Apart from It."" Again, I believe this was written relatively early in the ""epigenetic revolution,"" so both of Wells' papers were somewhat prophetic.

Really not that helpful for my needs.

My main issue with the book is the general lack of editorial feel. Most chapters are topical case studies which also describe how to do a task in perl (there is a companion website which provides equivalent python scripts). Especially since we were learning Python in this course and considering that the field is moving towards object-oriented languages, I rarely needed to reference this book.

There are several better introductions to genomics, so if you aren't interested in the 'how-to' of this field then I recommend passing on this book. Even if you are interested, consider other resources before this one.",4

As a first book for someone who was a yeast novice, I found it useful up to a point, but did not bother to read the whole thing, as much of it was irrelevent. Perhaps it's not intended to be read through in this way. Certainly this is a difficult subject to cover fully, as there are now many new variations on the screen which all have their own peculiarity.
A novice might want to read the most relevent chapters, someone with a problem with a specific screen might get something out of their specific chapter, but overall there is an almost equal amount (or greater) of information in the protocol booklets that come for free (or are freely downloadable) with commercial kits for Y2H.

MedIT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Principles of Biomedical Informatics,Almost perfect -,"This is an *excellent* book. I read it enthusiastically and I'm glad that it was available for me to do so. I think it fills a unique niche in the informatics book market in two ways:
- it is a book with significant attention to clinical informatics that has a strong computer science angle.
- it is an informatics ""monograph""

While informatics is often described as the intersection between something like computer science, life science/medicine and library science books rarely position themselves squarely at this intersection. I have found that it is easier to find bioinformatics books that have a strong computer science angle than it is to find clinical informatics books with a strong CS/implementation angle. This book is the exception to that rule. It has an unabashedly serious approach to the computing inherent in clinical informatics (one should take author's choice of Lisp as telling) and a clinical focus. The treatment of library science topics, while less rigorous, is present and credible.

Unlike the standard textbooks in the area (ex: Shortliffe) it is not an edited volume; rather, it hangs together page after page as a single work by a single author. Because it has the hand of an individual it a much more pleasant book to read from cover-to-cover.

The physical book is very appealing. The pager is glossy and thick, the binding is substantial, the dimensions are pleasant, the figures are clear, and the typesetting (as with all LaTeX books) beautiful. Unfortunately unlike most LaTeX books it is hard to read. While the pages look wonderful I found that function was sacrificed in the process. The vertical spacing is cramped, the margins are small, and the lines are long. This makes the going slow and difficult which detracts from an otherwise excellent book. If it was 50 pages longer with a bit more generous white space the book would be a complete home run.

In short, I have nothing but positive things to say about the content of this book and mixed emotions about the physical book. I would suggest that the ideal reader has some background in informatics. For total novices the larger edited volumes are a better starting point. Additionally, while a reasonable introduction to Lisp is provided some background knowledge of the language is helpful.

If you care about informatics, have a soft spot for Lisp and want to really hold the field in your hands this is a book that cannot be overlooked.",6
lisle_g,2.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Splunk,Simplistic yet complicated,"Here is my first complaint: for $45, I expect at least some of the diagrams to be in color. Instead, the publisher has a download site where you can get a color PDF of the diagrams. Annoying, particularly when the author writes ""If you haven't noticed, I have used the color attribute..."" No, it didn't really show up in the black-and-white diagram!!

The book tries to provide some high-level context for Splunk, but it is uneven. By page 7, the book discusses using a single Splunk server vs. multiple servers, but has built no foundation for this discussion. I often found myself saying: ""true, but why do I care?"" Other than a scattering of screenshots, the book has few illustrations (so maybe color isn't so important). The discussion also seems jumpy, as if the author has a number of facts about Splunk without having an organized way of presenting them. This made the topics harder to understand, even though most topics are treated superficially (e.g., sizing the Splunk installation). Even the detailed topics, like searching, start with a discussion of tags before even the most simple search is introduced.

I found some of the examples simplistic; most were not well-explained. Other examples illustrate poor Splunk usage, particularly around subsearches. Complex topics such as macros are introduced way too early and with little explanation. There are typos in some of the examples.

If you know Splunk, you won't learn anything new from this book. If you don't know Splunk, I don't know how you will achieve any of the items listed on the back of the book as ""what you will learn from this book.""

Another reviewer said that this book had a chapter on the Splunk documentation. It does not, but you could certainly look at the free tutorials, videos and online documentation at splunk.com, and save your money.",8

Emre Sevinc,4.0 out of 5 stars,Interactive and Dynamic Graphics for Data Analysis: With R and GGobi (Use R!),A valuable addition to any data-miner's library which shows the power of dynamic graphical methods,"This is definitely not an introductory tutorial or a how-to book on data visualization. The authors are the developers of the wonderful GGobi visualization system and its R integration and they have put lots of documentation online to which they don't hesitate to refer in many parts of the book. That means you have to have some background in R programming, statistical terminology, principal component analysis, etc.

The main strength of the book is providing very good examples depicting how dynamic graphics based analyses can help analytical methods. I especially consider the chapters on supervised classification and clustering very well designed. Many critical aspects are stressed and the importance of ""looking at data before diving into support vector machines, linear discrminant analysis, decision trees and self-organizing maps"" is shown from different perspectives (pun intended ;-)

If you are serious about data visualization, data mining and statistics then this book *along* with the accompanying website will be a very good guide. The exercises at the end of each chapter will also provide challenges as well as valuable insights.",13
Ekorn,3.0 out of 5 stars,Interactive and Dynamic Graphics for Data Analysis: With R and GGobi (Use R!),Does help you get into ggobi,"This book helped me get into ggobi, which is what I bought it for. Two main obstacles for new ggobi users are its peculiar user interface and awkward input of data. The latter issue is solved by the R package rggobi, which can use R data frames directly. The user interface is marginally better with rggobi; you can script the basic creation of figures, selection of datapoints, and choice of focal variables. The whole thing is still rather awkward, though: For example, to change views or interaction modes, you need to leave the figure window and visit the main ggobi window. While it is possible to change formatting (glyphs, colours, sizes) it is very difficult to figure out. The book is almost indispensable in taking you through the rather unintuitive workflow of (r)ggobi. The book also has OK introductions on classification and clustering. All in all it served its purpose, but I probably won't be coming back to it.

Users looking for an alternative might try the R package iplots, which has a somewhat smoother user interface; I ended up using both.",6
Charles R. Middaugh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Won for All: How the Drosophila Genome Was Sequenced,A rather silly little book...but mildly amusing,"This was a very disappointing book for me. Michael Ashburner is a very highly regarded Drosophilia geneticist who has made important scientific contributions in a number of areas and clearly played an important role in the sequencing of the Drosophilia genome. In this book, however, he comes off as almost insufferably arrogant. So much so, in fact, it is hard to believe that he is really the way he comes across in the book. I thought hard about the major problem of this narrative (not hard enough?) and it seems to me to be that it is simply too ""cute"" for its own good. If you are interested in Dr. Ashburners opinion of hotels and restaurants and the cute nicknames he has for his colleagues or accompanying vignettes (often in the form of footnotes), this might be the book for you. If not, I doubt you will find it of much interest. It lacks any introspective character and is somewhat disturbing (at least to me) regarding the attitudes of many of the people described toward science generally. It is almost as if the author has tried to out ""Double Helix"" Watson but missed the appropriate tone. Or perhaps he is making fun of Watson's book or the tendency of scientists to take themselves too seriously?-Whatever the case, it may be too subtle for me. It may not be a coincidence that the book is published by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. The author claims to have written the bulk of the text over a few weekends and that is exactly how it reads. If you are a member of the Drosophila research community (I am not), you might find it somewhat amusing. If not, I suspect you may be slightly horrified(I was).

It might be helpful to the uninitiated to read the epilogue written by Scott Hawley first since it provides a nice, useful background summary of the field that makes the body of the account more meaningful.",6

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Microarrays for an Integrative Genomics (Computational Molecular Biology),A helpful and informative overview,"The authors of this book are very excited about the prospects of the field of functional genomics and DNA microarray technology. Their optimism however is tempered by a large degree of caution, for they make it clear in the first few paragraphs of the book that expression profiling using microarrays is still in its infancy and that there have been exaggerated reports of its success. They wrote this book with the intent of giving the reader a more realistic view of microarray technology and have succeeded in their goal. They target the book specifically to experienced biologists and bioinformaticians with limited experience in using microarrays, and to students who are entering the field of bioinformatics. Most importantly, they emphasize that functional genomics is an experimental science, and that highly sophisticated algorithms from data mining or other areas of artificial intelligence will be of no assistance if the experimental information is not there in the first place. They do encourage however further development of these algorithms, in order to be able to extract the data as it becomes available, and as microarray technology itself matures. Even with the current technology, enormous amounts of data are generated, and if sense is to be made of this data, one will have to develop more effective algorithms than what are currently available.

To perform successful experiments, the authors describe a `functional genomics pipeline', and list the characteristics that it must have, consisting of both `wet' (laboratory) and `dry' (computational) steps. They devote a lot of space in the book describing how to develop an effective genomic experiment. Crucial to such investigations they say is a design that maximizes the possibility of observing relevant gene expression patterns, and the `experiment design space', which encapsulates all possible conditions that a particular biological system could be influenced by. Also important to the design is the `expression space', which is the collection of all potential expression values of all genes in a given genome. One could view the expression space as a vector space of high dimension, with each dimension corresponding to a single gene. Of great interest, and widely discussed in the general bioinformatics literature under the guise of the new field of `systems biology' is a subset of the expression space called the `transcriptome.' This subset models the expression of a cellular system under all stimuli. Considering that one might have to deal with 30,000 genes in the case of a human, the characterization of the transcriptome will be a formidable project. Interactions between the genes will complicate the analysis even further. The authors view each experiment as being an exploration of the space of all possible expression patterns, and describe good experimentation as being the `maximal exercise' of the genome. This consists of finding those correlations between the genes that have the greatest impact on the process under scrutiny.

A book on microarrays would not be complete if it did not discuss how they actually function. This is done in a fair detail in chapter three of the book. The authors do not favor a particular vendor but rather discuss what biological assumptions all microarray technology is based on. One of these assumptions is, as expected, that there is a direct connection between mRNA transcription and the protein translation associated with it.

In any laboratory experiment one has to deal with experimental uncertainty or ""noise."" This involves the influence of unknown external perturbations that result in variability in the outcomes of the experiment. As further evidence that the authors are careful experimenters, they discuss noise in detail, noting first that expression experiments deal with information that is both digital (DNA sequence information) and analog (mRNA expression levels). They distinguish between `intra-chip' noise, which arises when one probe feature influences another, improper scanning techniques, and manufacturing defects, and `inter-chip' noise, which arises from sample variation. Normalization issues are also discussed. Readers should take particular attention to the discussion on fold calculation and significance because of its connection with statistical analysis and because it sets the tone for the rest of the book. In particular, this discussion leads to the very important topic of dissimilarity and similarity measures. This part of the book is more sophisticated mathematically than what has been encountered so far, dealing for example with the concept of a metric space, which may appear to be somewhat abstract by readers who are not mathematically astute. Linear correlation and mutual information are two examples of metrics that are discussed.

Data mining is of course heavily discussed in the book, along with the new field of `ontological engineering' and how the latter is used functional genomics. Data mining is of course a vast field, but the authors give the reader a good taste of how some of its techniques can be applied to analyze microarray experiments. Both unsupervised and supervised learning is discussed, along with `self-organizing maps.' The authors end the book with their vision of future developments. Naturally they point to further refinements in microarray technology, the need for educating a new generation of bioinformaticists, and the push towards the development of new data mining algorithms. Certainly all of these are important, and one can expect other technological developments to occur in the coming years that may prove superior to microarrays in their application to functional genomics. In addition, and there are indications of this even at the present time, one can expect technologies that fully automate the study of gene expression. This includes the generation of hypotheses that characterize scientific investigation, the development and construction of the experiments themselves, and the analysis of the resulting data.",4

George J. Shannon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ontologies for Bioinformatics (Computational Molecular Biology),Title can mislead: Greater focus on methods than content of ontologies,"I was disappointed in this book in the lack of depth or breadth on a couple of key areas as follows:

Item 1 - It appeared to me that ontologies were not explained in sufficient detail to help ""newbies"" determine exactly why a specific ontology was created and the specific functions it is designed to support. I'm considering the UMLS to prototype a search engine because it is a compilation of a number of ontologies. However, this provides numerous options for subsetting the UMLS; for those relatively new to these ontologies it is not clear which ontology subsets are the most important (i.e., which play a pivotal or lesser role for my intended use). For example, I can include SNOMED and HL7 subsets, but do they provide redundant concepts for my needs and if so, in which areas? It is not practical for me to learn then all, so I was hoping to obtain this information from this book. Unfortunately I was unable to do so quickly and have to dig more on my own (which was the reason to buy the book.....).

Item 2 - I noticed a couple of areas that may be missing for those more interested in the tools and process of using ontologies. For example, I did not see the Protege and LexGrid tools for visualization, from Stanford and Mayo Clinic respectively, in the index (I had located them in prior web search). In a more general sense, as I've been working with ontologies more and more, I've noticed that platform selection and interoperability seem to be stumbling blocks. This topic was not a major focus in the book.

Due to the breadth and complexity of the platforms and tools needed to effectively use ontologies, and the complexity and size of the ontologies themselves, addressing both of these large subjects in sufficient detail in one book may be very difficult. Perhaps this is the reason that this book did not reach the 5 stars potential. Perhaps it would if it had addressed one or the other, but not both.

Perhaps if the description and title clarified the focus of the book, I would have gotten a better idea of the content before purchasing (and unfortunately, returning).

Keep in mind that I'm relatively new to using ontologies.",4
Scott,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Stuff of Life: A Graphic Guide to Genetics and DNA,Understanding Genetics Made (a little) Easier - The Graphic Treatment,"It is no small task to explain how atoms form into chemicals, chromosomes, and the proteins which make up 'the stuff of life'. But Mark Shultz attempts to do that in just under 150 pages. Schultz uses a graphic novel format and copious illustrations to make this sometimes daunting topic accessible to the general reader. The book uses a visual learning style, mirroring each point with an illustrations as it drives through Shultz's text, which can sometimes be as dense in information as the coiled strands of DNA the book is attempting to explain.

The premise for the book is that an intelligent race of Squinch (similar to our sea cucumbers, but intelligent) are in peril as their species lacks genetic diversity. Coming to the rescue is Chief Scientist Bloort 183 who presents a galaxy-spanning report on the nature of Earth's DNA and genetics. Bloort must explain to his Supreme Highness how the reproductive strategy used by Earth's creatures brings about species diversity and why it is a winning strategy for life.

The text is written at a level suitable for high-school and college freshmen. My seventh-grader, who is studying genetics as a part of her curriculum said most of the book was over her head. I would recommend following up this book with a more in-depth exploration provided by MIT's OpenCoursware biology 700 series of video lectures, which are the lectures MIT provides its Freshmen.

The pace is very brisk and at times the terms and concept come fast and furious. Bloort does pause to make sure that the his Highness is able to recap one or two of the key points. The book does well when it uses the illustrations to explain some of the more difficult to grasp concepts, such as those related to molecular and cellar-level genetics. And it is at its best when it slows down long enough to explain a particularly difficult concept using more than a single example to illustrate the point. For the most part the illustrations worked well to reinforce the point being discussed, but the illustrations are also used as a counterpoint, providing some light-hearted relief.

In trying to explain genetic diversity the book starts with atoms, shows how they self-assemble into DNA and RNA and explains the processes RNA uses to copy DNA or assemble amino acids and proteins. The book does an excellent job of explaining the workings of chromosomes and inheritance, illustrating how the shuffling of genes leads to dominant and recessive traits, such as eye color. Genetic mutations are explored, part of nature's arsenal for genetic diversity. The book also touches on the genetic relatedness of all Earth's species and delves into the latest efforts of the Human Genome Project to read the entire DNA code for our own species.

The book makes several brief stops to touch on topics of social interest, such as the politicization of science by the Soviet Union, cloning as it was used by vintners, and genetic counseling.

The book is not without its blemishes, such as page 44 ""DNA from a Human Perspective, Part 2,"" which appears twice, including once where p36 should be. Part 1 seems to be missing due to an editorial or printing error. Nevertheless, this page exists to redress the wrong done to Rosalind Franklin, a female scientist and co-discover of DNA's structure, who originally went uncredited for her work in helping to discover the double helix shape of DNA. James Watson and Francis Crick received the lion's share of credit (and a Nobel Prize) for the discovery of the shape of DNA, but their work was most likely aided by access to Franklin's fine X-ray photographs of DNA's structure. Perhaps because of the male-dominated times, and partially because Franklin died of breast cancer before the Nobel prizes were awarded, she receives prominent mention in this section, returning her to a place in history posthumously.

Another minor nit occurs on page 128, which shows the split with proto-humans and chimps from a common ancestor, but would be more correct if it depicted the split as being between proto-humans and proto-chimps, since chimps, as well as humans, continued to evolve genetically during the past 5-million years.

This slender volume packs in a good deal of information, and is a fine way to gain a better understanding of the subject of life and how it works under the covers. The graphic novel format draws readers in and I found myself rooting for Bloort as he makes his case for understanding the science behind our genetic success.",44
Jeremy M. Harris,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Stuff of Life: A Graphic Guide to Genetics and DNA,An invitation to think pictorially,"This wonderful book uses the power of extensive, inventive graphics paired with well-chosen text to illustrate and explain many important aspects of genetics and DNA. It introduces concepts at a level basic enough for the general reader, but also includes material detailed and deep enough to interest an expert. The graphic style and panel layout are reminiscent of a comic book only in the best sense -- they make the reading experience rapid and effortless.

For entertainment value the factual content is woven into a story involving hyperintelligent invertebrates which inhabit the planet Glargal and vaguely resemble sea cucumbers. The Glargalians are plagued by a heritable disorder which threatens their existence, and they have launched an extensive study of Earth creatures in an effort to understand and perhaps cure their own genetic affliction. The narrator of the book is the interplanetary biologist Bloort 183, who is reporting on his findings to the Glargalian leadership council. The obsequious behavior of Bloort toward the supreme leader provides comic relief, but the background story is wisely kept exactly that -- it interferes not at all with with the book's main objective, which is to transmit Bloort 183's copiously illustrated report directly to the reader.

The story begins with a brief reprise of our planet's origin, the appearance of lightning-induced chemical compounds, their extension into self-reproducing molecules, and self-assembly of the first unicellular bacteria. More detail is added as the narrative progresses to multicellular organisms, prehistoric flora and fauna, and eventually hominids. The remaining 90 percent of the book explains and illustrates in considerable depth the reproductive and genetic characteristics of modern animals and humans, both at the cellular level and as expressed in the resulting variety among individuals.

A primary source of the book's ability to sustain reader interest is the highly successful integration of text and graphics. An excellent script by Mark Schultz is ingeniously (and often humorously) rendered in a pictorial style that continuously illustrates why the bromide ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" has proved so durable. Mr. Schultz's job was to create a concise but comprehensive textual frame which allows the graphics to amplify the message with maximum impact and efficiency. In this he succeeds remarkably well, with interesting and significant points appearing on practically every page as the scientific framework of genetics and heredity unfolds logically (technical content was vetted for accuracy by David C. Bates).

Helpful coverage is given to historical context, including the personalities and scientific discoveries underlying molecular biology. A series of ten special ""perspective pages,"" distributed throughout the book, covers relevant background topics such as personalities related to DNA, the structure of chromosomes, the mechanics of inheritance, the politics of genetics, and common misunderstandings about mutants. An illustrated glossary helps with many of the technical terms which inevitably arise in texts reaching explanatory levels beyond the trivial.

The artwork by Zander and Kevin Cannon (who are, incidentally, not related) is central to the ease with which the book clarifies difficult biological concepts. The clever graphical metaphors shamelessly anthropomorphize things like genes and proteins, but in such a broad and amusing way that no reader will be misled. Examples of outstanding graphical creativity abound, and one of the best is a portrait of the DNA molecule on page 26. I have seen many illustrative DNA schematics before, but this full-page portrait in extremely strong perspective, with well-chosen comments tucked in along the sides, is a virtuoso performance in vivid scientific communication. The base pair rungs and sugar-phosphate side chains stand out clearly without compromising the unavoidably complex spatial relationships enforced by the twisting dual helices.

Overall, I found reading ""The Stuff of Life"" a delightful and enlightening experience.",6

After reading it, I went to my department head and (after he looked at the book) had little trouble convincing him to buy a classroom set to use to teach the basics of genetics. My class is now about half-way through the book and the students all seem to enjoy taking some time out to read (no mean feat in and of itself), and some have even said that seeing the pictures in the book has helped them with topics they were having trouble with.

wiredweird,4.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Analysis of Gene Expression Microarray Data,Outstanding survey,"Microarray studies are becoming the preferred research tools in many areas, including cancer research, development studies, and studies in organisms' responses to their environments. Because of differences between organisms or between experiments, microarray data is always statistical in nature. The problem is that the data aren't well suited to traditional statistics. Instead of studying a few characteristics in large numbers of individuals, microarray studies typically yield thousands of data values for a few dozen samples.

That mismatch, between current statistical practice and microarray analysis requirements, seem to be driving many innovations in statistical analysis. This book is a brief survey of four of those areas of analysis: model-based analysis, experimental design, classification, and clustering.

The first section, on model-based analysis, is brief. Mostly, it seems to establish the language used in later sections. The next, on experimental design, deals with ways for getting the most information out of the fewest samples. The costs of arrays and processing are dropping, but still high. More analysis on less data makes good economic sense. The DNA samples analyzed also have costs - some can only be prepared in minute amounts, others must be extracted surgically from human patients. Either way, it's important to maximize the knowledge harvested from limited amounts of biologcal material.

The next section, on discrimination, is a bit longer. It briefly summarizes a wide variety of techniques for deciding which category best represents any one sample. This section gives a good review of analytic approaches: Fisher classifiers and their descendants, principal components, support vectors, and decision trees. Within trees, the authors note that the number of missing values in typical microarray data may interfere with standard analysis, and that surrogate variables may be needed in many cases. AI and data mining techniques aren't broadly represented, but this chapter is still very informative.

The final section, on clustering, was shorter. It was reasonably informative, and I gleaned a few new facts from it. Mostly, though, it seemed to present techniques that are already well known.

This book is a survey, so it emphasizes breadth over depth. Many algorithms described only briefly, and some are just mentioned by name. The developer will need to chase references to find an implementable level of detail. Still, the book has value as an index to references and as a comparison of techniques.

blargle,4.0 out of 5 stars,Molecular Biology of the Gene,Superb and clearly written.,"This book strikes the perfect balance of clarity and brevity. The explanations are thorough without being verbose, and the book does not try to go out of its way to be a comprehensive guide to biochemistry or cell biology, which is not its subject matter. Instead what one gets are clear, focused, easy-to-read explanations of the core of molecular biology (replication, transcription, translation, DNA damage and maintenance) that are essential for anyone working in the life sciences. Additionally, the illustrations are eminently clear and do not contain any unnecessary information.

One major complaint I have is the illustrations for phage lambda gene regulation. The DNA is shown as a single cylinder, but this is misleading because genes reside on both strands. It is important to remember the directionality of genes and promoters in this system, and condensing all information onto a single strand temporarily inhibited my understanding of this section.

Also, the next edition introduces a new chapter on RNA and its role in gene regulation - i.e. riboswitches, RNAi, and RNA silencing. This material is completely absent from this edition since it is so new.

Overall this is the finest example of a textbook I have come across in my undergraduate career. I always came away from reading it with a clear picture of what was being described. The does one thing and does it well - clear descriptions of molecular biology.",2

In addition, the book comes with online supplementary material with short self assessments that are actually useful. They aren't just an after thought. It actual helps with your understanding of the material.The figures and illustrations are of high quality and resolution. I couldn't find an error anywhere in the book.

The problem is that there is no published theory (Including quantum mechanics) that quantitatively describes the vector forces acting on molecules within biologic cells. This has resulted in a proliferation of wild ideas as to the physical dimensions, mass and chemical properties of biologic molecules to explain experimental results e.g. The synthesis of proteins from amino acids.
The text is eminently readable and of profound interest, but a quantitative physical theory of the origin of the vector forces that act on the ~Avogadro's Number of atoms that come together to form a biologic organelle is necessary in order to understand how DNA encodes for an organelle. Whatever the physical mechanism is that creates vector forces in the biologic cell, that mechanism must also be encoded by DNA.",2
R. Mckissick,5.0 out of 5 stars,Molecular Biology of the Gene,35 years full circle fantastic true,"While in High School I took the class Mol. Bio. Gene from Dr. Watsons book at George Washington U., having taken orga. &inorganic&biochem at the community college after basic chem (my HS was colocated with the comm col. in Rockville MD). Paid $14.65 for mine, a f...king fortune then. I was working for Dr. Gallo (CDC) at NIH as a summer intern, riding my bike there. (Hey it's all about ME) So... I barely passed the class...it was tough. The book is still alive and kicking, and here I am back using it to understand/design a water treatment system for a small San Diego commun(ity). I thought the old man Watson died? UCSD has a center named for him.

So amazingly, for most things that are true, test of time. This book is amazing in clearly explaining the genetic processes involved. Back then (1972) I spent a lot of time slogging through the biochem then my org. chem text book (at 16). I was building the models to understand what the hell Watson was talking about in bonding, recumbinant replication , etc. Since my NIH job involved collectiing data from experiments designed by doctors working for Dr. Gallo bent on discovering a viral gene attack (read AIDS) I was able to seriously confuse and annoy the doctors/phds by my incessant half informed questions, and screwups (has any of that changed?)

Buy it! Use it! many lab processes have changed, but the book is seminal, with original idiots like me having become like the Olive Tree (if only I could have been in the Garden...), from that seed.

The authors make a decent case, via biography, naming conventions, history, genealogy, iconography, linguistics, and, to a lesser extent, DNA for many of those historically in very high places in Scotland having come from Jewish roots -- and, to some extent, having preserved them despite abundant reasons to abandon them. I don't think that they prove the case implicit in their ambitious title; indeed I doubt the authors would actually argue that they had done so, probably feeling that if they have opened the question for discussion they have done their work well. I think they have done that, and good for them!

I do have a few quibbles:

1. While I understand it's now stylistically correct to have the footnotes at the end of the book, this is an example where the book would have been greatly improved by having the footnotes on the pages they reference. Too many times a reference in the text was not clear to me when I was reading the text, but when I subsequently read the footnotes I had an ""aha!"" moment. I wonder how much more I would have gotten out of my reading if I had had the aha! moment when reading the text. The footnotes, by the way, are excellent.
2. I had recently read Abba Rubin's excellent ""Images in Transition: The English Jew in English Literature, 1660 - 1830"" and noted that the authors could have supported their case with Rubin's book. It belongs in the bibliography at any rate.
3. It's perfectly human when writing family history (this book is to some extent a family history) to choose one's examples from one's own history. Thus, it was no surprise that the authors did so here. However, I wish they had elected to expand their Jewish DNA argument to include some of the J1 and J2 haplotypes found in Scotland. While the R1bs they use may have been Jewish at some point, virtually all the J1s and J2s (which include the Cohanic Modal Haplotype) can be traced to the Middle East with little or no ambiguity -- unlike the R1bs. Another reviewer has noted that 12 markers is also pretty limited to draw firm conclusions from (that's true), and the authors are apologetic about their sample size and obvious selection biases (again true), but I'm willing to give them a bye on this given their 2006 copyright date. For the time, it was pretty good data. No doubt better data is available today.

Since I mentioned family history, I'll add that the book was personally useful to me since I was surprised a year or so ago to find that I have a J1 haplotype, and with the surname of Brown and a very elusive family tree prior to 1800, and that most of my closest DNA matches are with men surnamed Graham. Well, I may not have found the specific non-marital event that produced my line, but I feel much closer to knowing the geography in which it occurred thanks to this book -- and the clear association between the two families it describes.",46

Seems there is a little Scottish Cluster that takes in a small percentage of many surnames in Scotland and that originates with a Jewish priest about 60 generations ago. 30 years to a generation is 1800 years ago is 150 AD or even at the time of Christ.
A match with a Polish person as fourth cousin, when there are no Polish people in my family tree aroused suspicions. Seems my R1b1a2a1a1a4 has even Cohen matches.
This polish person has a surname I match on my Y-dna 30 generations ago that was Cohen levite in 1820. Other like Family Finder matches confirm this suspicion. There are many matches to Jewish surnames in my Y-dna. Even others have had the same experience with their Family Finder results. People with Scottish ancestry matching Jewish people in Romania! Jewish DNA is passed on in clumps because of intensive intermarriage over thousands of years. Thus the match to fourth cousin when this is probably more than 30th cousin. I always had an unction of distant Jewish ancestry.

Even mtdna results showed Scottish Jewish roots with I3 and H1e.

The R1b1 Jewish attention in this book is well deserved.

Arno Vosk,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When Scotland Was Jewish: DNA Evidence, Archeology, Analysis of Migrations, and Public and Family Records Show Twelfth Century Semitic Roots",Fun to read and honest,"This book belongs to the genre, ""The Jews did everything!"" That said, it's an interesting review of Scottish history, beginning around the departure of the Romans from Britain in the 5th Century C.E. and going to the Reformation and beyond. Disclaimer: I'm a Jewish bagpiper, and ever since reading this book I've been teasing my Scottish bandmates.
The authors are honest in distinguishing known facts from speculation, but they are not reticent about advancing their arguments that traditionally Scottish things, ranging from the Presbyterian Church to the bagpipe, might have had Jewish roots. If you demand certainty you won't enjoy this book. If you are tickled by the idea that the mysterious St. Machar--who has a church dedicated to him in Aberdeen, but about whom virtually nothing definite is known--has a Jewish name, the same as the character in Sholem Aleichem/Fiddler on the Roof, then you will find it pretty interesting.
The first of the two central ideas of the book is that Scottish culture, beginning in the Dark Ages, was much more advanced, complex and independent than most histories, written from an English point of view, would make it seem. (Anytime you conquer a people, it's routine to try to make them seem stupid and barbaric.) The second is that a large number of Sephardic Jews fleeing persecution in southern Europe ended up in Scotland, and that these people, though outwardly Christian, nevertheless continued many Jewish traditions which have left permanent traces in the nation. Though difficult to prove beyond any doubt, these ideas are both pretty interesting.
I'm not conversant with the subtleties of DNA tracing, and so can't comment on that part of argument. The style of the book is very readable. The cost is an obstacle. I found a half-price copy through Amazon.",24

The ""Jewish"" names they cite are, for the most part, not Jewish at all. How they get Jewishness from them is beyond me to understand. As for the ""Jewish"" symbols on graves and other places in Scotland - so?? These symbols have been used by Christians over and over. Nothing new there. I did find one of my own ancestors listed, Thomas Isaac. I will admit that his name is hardly Scottish and I have found nothing about him anywhere I have researched. But then, they didn't either. The only explanation I could come up with was the Jewish expulsion from England in 1290. Some Jews did migrate to Scotland, and my ancestor was born in Scotland in 1306. But I have no proof and they offered none. The assertion that the Kings of Scotland were Jewish is absurd. After such statements, they simply let it drop without proving their point.

From that perspective, I would rank this book 5 stars. It really satisfied my need to understand what is required to make the leap into this area.
This book is a real broad swatch of all the different skills that one needs to know to assume a basic competency in bioinformatics. On page 14, they actually list core essential skills and ""nice to have skills"". molecular biology, Unix, Perl, algorithms, major biology software packages are all on the essential core list. The auuthors really take the viewpoint on here is how to set your computer up (on a budget!), web sites to go to and so on. Not knowing Unix and not having it currently on my computer made the two Unix/Linux chapters academic.
The book is great from the perspective of seeing the big picture. Where it falls down is in the depth department. ""Predicting Protein Structure and Function from Sequence"" is covered in 35 pages! It is impossible to understand this subject in 35 pages - yet the authors conveyed a sense of the subject and how it fits into a larger picture.

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Developing Bioinformatics Computer Skills: An Introduction to Software Tools for Biological Applications by Cynthia Gibas (2001-05-03),HIGHLY recommended for those entering bioinformatics,"This book is an excellent introduction to bioinformatics for a person entering the field or deciding to enter. The author's introduction to UNIX in the second part of the book is better written than most books devoted completely to UNIX. The discussion would be even better if some words were said about the new MAC OS X operating system. With its UNIX flavor, and the ease of use of a MAC, it will no doubt make its presence known in bioinformatics. Publication timing may have prevented a discussion of it however since OS X has just been released in the last few months.
A non-mathematical but very informative overview of sequence analysis is given in part three of the book. A mathematician who might be deciding to enter this exciting field will the discussion good preparation for further technical reading in computational biology and sequence algorithms. The authors even include a discussion of mathematical physiology and give URLs and a list of companies attempting to create user applications in this area of computational biology. This is a further example of the book's merits, as it shows what areas in bioinformatics need more application tools to be developed.
Even the rather short chapter on PERL programming still suffices to create an appreciation of the power of PERL in bioinformatics. What takes sometimes many weeks of development time and many lines of code can frequently be done in a matter of hours and a few lines of code in PERL.
The book ends with an introduction to databases and data mining, and, even though the discussion is short, the authors explain the concepts well. Data mining in this field, as in others, is a subject that will take on further importance in the near future.
In addition, the book is just plain fun to read. A large set of references is given along with many URLs throughout the book. I visited all of these Websites and with their content and the book at hand....I had a BLAST.",30

This book, Developing Bioinformatics Computer Skills is an outstanding introduction for the biologist attempting to become broadly familar with the basics of the bioinformatics field.

This section has an outstanding non-mathematical explanation of scoring matrices and dynamic programming for alignments. This is followed by chapters on protein structure and predicting protein structure and function from sequence. They also discuss tools for sequence assembly, annotating genomes, proteomics and biochemical pathway databases. There is an excellent chapter on analysis of large data sets using Perl scripts. The book closes with chapters on building relational databases and data visualization. The material is well written and clearly presented, and can serve as an excellent springboard to more advanced texts in the field.

THere are some nice chapters on how to setup a Linux system and learning some basic commands , but there are other O'reilly books to help with that (Learning the unix operating system comes to mind). On the other hand, for a computer programmer/IT person, if you were sharp and could stand to wade through some of the references the author suggests for learning more about molecular biology, you could probably apply what you learn in this book pretty well. Perhaps they should have named this Intro to Bioinformatics skills. However, there are some glaring errors in the book, most notably in the intro chapters to molecular biology, esp. the diagrams for how DNA is converted into RNA and is in turn translated into a polypeptide.

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Artificial Immune Systems: Third International Conference, ICARIS 2004, Catania, Sicily, Italy, September 13-16, 2004, Proceedings (Lecture Notes in Computer Science)",Pretty good overview,"Bio-inspired computing has taken the world by storm in the last few decades, going by the names of neural networks, genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, and swarm intelligence. Another one has arisen in the last 15 years or so, is inspired by the biology of the immune system, and is the subject of this book. The authors of the book are aware that the approach is novel, but do a good job of presenting the field who like the reviewer are newcomers to the field, but want to know what it is all about and if it indeed has useful applications. They discuss their own work in the area and that of others, and extensive references are given for further reading.

After a short introduction to the subject in chapter 1, the authors move on to a description of the biological immune system in chapter 2. They stress the need for understanding the mechanisms that regulate the adaptive immune response, so as to be able to control the transformation of an immune response from an ""aggressive"" to a ""benign"" state. The authors explain the difference between the ""innate"" immune system and the ""adaptive"" immune system. As the name implies, the adaptive immune response is a kind of ""learning"" ability that allows the immune system to improve itself as antigens are encountered. The innate immune response though remains constant along the lifetime of the organism. A short description of the T-cells and B-cells is given, some of which can differentiate into ""memory cells""; that remain circulating in the body and protect against a given antigen. Particularly interesting is the role of ""pattern recognition receptors""; that recognize molecular patterns associated with pathogens. The clonal selection theory of the adaptive immune system, along with the somewhat controversial immune network theory.

Chapter 3 is an overview of how to to actually create an artificial immune system (AIS). The emphasize that anything deemed controversial in the biological framework need not be when viewed from a computational perspective, such as the immune network theory. Biology is used for the inspiration of the computational models, and as such they need not reflect entirely what is true in the biological case. They also emphasize that the various attempts to simulate the immune system on computers are not examples of an AIS. Also, an AIS is more than just a pattern recognition algorithm, even though it must employ this in its use. To give a framework for an AIS, the authors employ a model of immune cells and molecules called a ""shape-space"". In this shape space one models the affinity of the ""molecules""; via a metric, which the authors eventually choose to be the Hamming metric. They then give an overview of various algorithms for modeling the immune system, such as bone marrow, thymus, and immune network models, in addition to clonal selection algorithms. For those readers familiar with dynamical systems, the immune network models are very interesting, due to the use of differential equations, and also the fact that such in immune network models the immune system is performing even in the absence of external stimuli.

Chapter 4 gives a survey of artificial immune systems, such as spectra recognition for chemical reactions, infectious disease surveillance, analysis of medical data, and computational security. The latter was of particular importance to the reviewer, so more attention was directed to the discussion and the references than other parts of the book. The issue with the approaches for network intrusion detection and virus detection lie mostly in the performance of the network. Agents that are cleverly designed may form a very accurate way of detecting this malicious behavior, but their deployment on a network may degrade its performance considerably.

In chapter 7, the authors discuss various case studies in artificial immune systems that shed more light on the examples of Chapter 4. The computer network security application is discussed again, and a low number of false positives is shown to follow after the artificial immune system is simulated. However, the performance of the network is not pointed out by the authors. The authors also give more details on the application of artificial immune systems to data analysis and optimization. The discussion is interesting, but it is still an open question as to whether this approach is indeed better than other ones in optimization theory, i.e. how does the immune approach compare with the ""free-lunch"" theorems so often quoted in optimization theory? The authors do make a brief comparison of their optimization algorithm with evolution strategies, and this is somewhat helpful to those who are familiar with the latter. The last chapter of the book looks to future applications of artificial immune systems, and in its connection with learning paradigms in artificial intelligence. The authors are open-minded about the future of AIS but also subject it to critical analysis.

The book motivated the reviewer to investigate the use of AIS more fully, and to begin thinking about possible applications, such as 1. Event correlation in networks. 2. Network routing: Routes that are inefficient are viewed as ""antigens"";, and the network immune system will then cure the system of these routes, meaning that it will remember them as being antigens up to some practical time scale. The routing scheme in place will not implement these routes within this time frame. 3. The TCP/IP protocol in the context of the immune network theory where reliable connections are based on the epitope/paratope recognition capability. Any emergent properties of the network overlaid with the TCP/IP protocol such as learning, memory, and self-tolerance could be studied by viewing the packet network as an immune network. 4. Network QoS, with packets marked as low priority viewed as temporary antigens. 5. Using the function optimization capabilities of AIS do calculate the effective bandwidth of ATM networks. 6. Data analysis, particularly in the construction of algorithms to distinguish chaos from noise.",10
Neil Cotiaux,4.0 out of 5 stars,Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution,Human Nature Has Never Been Static,"What is ""human nature""? And will failure to initiate widespread government oversight of scientific research that could change this definition open a Pandora's Box of dire consequences?

Fukuyama suggests that failure to impose substantial government dictates over the ""when's"" and ""how's"" of future research centering on the human body and mind will precipitate a significant sea change in the inherent nature of our species, how we interact with one another, and a potential threat to Liberal Democracy. The implicit message is that unfettered scientific inquiry will lead to developments we will come to deeply regret.

While Fukuyama correctly illustrates the ""easy fixes"" that our society has latched onto (Prozac, Ritilin: Who said freedom to choose would mean wise choices?), his thesis fails to acknowledge the considerable roadblocks that authorities have placed in the way of the evolution of our species throughout history.

""Human nature"" has, in fact, demonstrated a rather elastic nature over time. If one accepts the premise that human nature is fixed in an eternal quest for freedom, self-development and dignity and is manifested in superior intelligence, then one would want to remove any artificial roadblocks to creating the maximum environment in which these attributes could flourish. How else to explain the demise of almost all competing political models to Liberal Democracy? Yet, Fukuyama proposes a step backward, based on what appears to be a fixed, non-elastic definition of human nature.

Were a caveman to be plopped down in the late 20th Century and witness the first heart transplant, would he recoil in disgust and declare the practice inimical to the basic fabric of human existence? Quite likely. Does that mean, with the limited intelligence of a less developed brain - but with a brain nonetheless and all basic body parts and feelings that ""Modern Man"" exhibits - that the caveman would be right? I don't believe anyone would answer in the affirmative.

As dispassionate and thoughtful as Fukuyama's work appears on the surface, his call to action would have us expand the yoke of State control at a time when his beloved model of Liberal Democracy is finally expanding across the globe, toppling barriers to the practical application of human intelligence everywhere.

Which, in its own way, is rather ironic.",6

Rodrigo Negrete Prieto,4.0 out of 5 stars,Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution,A risk map not to be ignored,"There is no doubt that Francis Fukuyama is a thinker who performs pretty well in a strategic scale. He aptly outlines one of the leading subjects who will shape the political, cultural, religious and economic clashes of the XX1 century and is as his best both synthesizing a lot of relevant information and detecting as well the transcendence of some debates apparently out of the public and media limelight (such as the Searle-Dennett on the role and nature of consciousness) not only because their implications, but also because they are symptoms of how scientism has taken over more and more territories of the human identity to a point that is not so far away to deny it. But above all the best asset of this book consists on his clear understanding on which is at stake. The disruptive potential of the more extreme forms of technological hubris such as genetic ""improvement ""applied to human genome it is clearly stated: because as unintended consequence it could lead not only to a sort of ""arms race"" between states but also within society itself (among private citizens with de facto different access to resources) inequality would acquire another dimension and meaning. Under a perspective where a society of classes could take the path of a society of castes, the whole foundations of political order, as was understood in the western tradition would crumble. The peril is simply that differences in socioeconomic terms turn into a difference in biological terms. The mere possibility of that gap is just unbearable for a modern society. If that happen class struggle never had before a stronger motivation.

No less important is his identification of how inadequate is the utilitarian philosophy that pervades economical thinking which its mantra ""minimize pain/maximize pleasure"" when it invades other areas of human action especially medical practice. The peril consists on blurring the difference between healing and enhancement. Actually it disorients society in important issues such as how to deal with drugs consumption. We have not to wait to extreme forms of human nature manipulation to detect that trend in the current abuses in using Prozac or Ritalin. Some cases for which the safer bet is to enforce nerve, self control and character are taking short cuts when the easy way is a technological manipulation of behavior.

In this sense Fukuyama's strongest point is that even a democratic assumption of enhancement and improvement for everyone -when genetic engineering takes the helm as the leading technology to achieve those goals- is that it is not preposterous to think the biological differentiation of beings it would yield as a result may resemble rather a sort of Nietzschean dystopia where the best intentions of that pursuit have not place at all: a new order where shared human ideals have not to be recognized any longer.

Fukuyama without wasting time identifies to which extend the whole conceptual building of the ethical and political tradition -at least of the west- depends on two crucial assumptions: there is a human nature and there is a human dignity. But in taking these issues he falls short. He understands that the challenge to face now is to find new secular foundations to both ideas grounded in the disintegrating bedrock of metaphysics, religion and theology, but far to solve the conundrum (after all the book is only 218 pp long) he rather gets to draw with precision the map of the future battles to come. The author intends a solution alternative to the Kantian sharp distinction between actions based on knowledge and action based on ethics (categorical imperatives) at the time he insists that science does not have -and cannot have- the last world in defining ultimate human values and goals. But he bets anyway in some sort of knowledge in route to find new foundations to the very idea of human nature, so what kind of knowledge could be that? Maybe the sort of knowledge we can find in literature which is not systematic almost by definition, maybe the sort of knowledge that some thinkers as Merlin Donald intends (by the way with very interesting results indeed) which are at mid point between philosophy and scientific knowledge: an argumentation where the latter still is the tool, not the master.

However and beyond what FF achieved or not I am tempted to say that every citizen should read it. But because it sounds as an overstatement I only wish that someday it will be discussed in every college at any level, alongside with Neil Postman's amazingly intelligent, witty little book entitled ""Technopoly"".",5
William S Jamison,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution,Wonderful experience!,"Fukuyama has been one of my favorites since ""The End of History."" Glad to see history has started again and science is the new narrative! ""Posthuman"" continues to demonstrate that the author has a very comprehensive view of current insights in many fields and puts them in a cohesive picture that rings true. Reading Fukuyama is a great way to read a hundred up-to-date books all at once and get the highlights from all of them. Expect frequent pauses while reading this as your own mind reels with the ideas.
This is a great read for those who want to know everything and understand it too.

P. Tseng,2.0 out of 5 stars,Perl for Bioinformatics,"At best, an extremely pricey handbook","Although the editorial review claims that Perl for Bioinformatics ""introduces Perl to the bio/computer scientist interested in or working in bioinformatics,"" this is really a bit of a misnomer. While it does contain a decent quantity of useful, relevant reference information for a bioinformatics student, the (dollar) price tag is far too high. Furthermore, no real introduction to Perl is found in the book, save the preface in pp. 4-5--that is to say, some basic knowledge of Perl will be an absolute requirement. As a student, I would personally lean toward any of the excellent O'Reilly bioinformatics and/or Perl books myself; they are well written, contain much of the same relevant information with additional explanations, and at a much lower price per page. Bottom line: You may find Perl for Bioinformatics useful as a pocket reference guide, but it is probably not worth the astronomical price.",6

David Moskovitz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bioinformatics: A Primer,"Very Confusing, Little Explanation, and Some Answers Are Just Wrong","I am learning assembly language and hoped that this book would help me. My instructor is well meaning, but also extremely confusing and not very helpful. I then turned to the book and hoped I could learn outside of class with it. I couldn't of been more wrong. The book literally devotes about 2 to 4 pages per chapter. That essentially means you have major concepts to learn with only about a paragraph to explain them. It then gives literally no examples for some very challenging concepts while devoting whole chapters on things which are not very relevant. I've also found errors in it's ""answers in the back of the book"" (which is only for about 1/10th or less of the questions). The questions you use to test yourself are extremely confusing and not well wrote. It is almost more challenging to figure out what the question is asking rather than simply answering it. Then since the subject matter is really hard and you don't want to learn it in the wrong way (which is really easy) you simply can't check your answers in the back. It most definitely should of had all odd answers in the back of the book...

Anyways some people may find this book good, but I don't recommend it for people who don't get outside help to understand the concepts. It literally leaves me more confused rather than confident when I read it....",4
JRockFL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bioinformatics: A Primer,Best primer on 80x86 Aseembly Language - by far!,"If all you're looking for is a no fuss book on how to code in x86 Assembly, then this book's for you. I have looked through other x86 books that spend too much time focusing on hardware, assembly translations and mathematics instead of focusing on how to code. Most chapters are concise and stay on-topic without adding excess fluff.

In this edition, Detmer primarily uses Visual Studio with his own custom plug-ins (downloadable from the publisher's website) to walk you through the chapters. Visual Studio's provides excellent debugger tools to monitor register values, memory, and to analyze code line by line. Detmer also provides good walkthroughs on what the code is doing behind the scenes. Unlike guides from other books, I have had no problems setting up my computer to code and analyze x86 assembly.

In order to make the most out of this book, you will need proficient knowledge of C or C++, and some basic knowledge of data structures - particularly stacks. You will also need a good understanding of binary and hexadecimal arithmetic. Thankfully, Detmer does a fine job of providing a refresher on the arithmetic in the first chapter.

The programming problems are also excellent and help reinforce the material you just learned. Some problems are very basic while others encourage you to experiment and try writing basic search/sorting algorithms. In cases, where a problem might be challenging, Detmer provides a basic algorithm in pseudocode for you to try and translate into assembly language.

Two cons: Although Detmer does cover 64-bit programming in special chapters, most of this book covers 32-bit. Detmer does not dive in too deep on 64-bit programming as much as I would have liked. However, as a I said before, this book is an excellent primer and will help you get the ball rolling in further studies of x86 Assembly language. If you want to focus time on 64-bit programming, then this book will certainly help you with that but it by no means a one-stop shop. The other complaint is in the price of the book. The book is a paperback with approximately 350 pages - many of which consist of code listings and diagrams. Paying over $100 for this book seems outrageous.",6
Michael Myers,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bioinformatics: A Primer,"A good introduction to the topic, but that is all","I bought this book as a refresher and as a reference to keep on my shelf at work, where I need to write (or at least read and understand) some Intel x86 assembly from time to time. I was looking for something that wasn't as outdated as my college textbook, ""80X86 IBM PC and Compatible Computers: Assembly Language, Design, and Interfacing, Vols. 1 and 2"" by Mazidi et al (mine is the second edition). That is the problem with a lot of assembly books, is that they pre-date the 32-bit instruction set (the 80386 and higher CPUs) and hence they give a lot of bad and just wrong advice. This book does not have that problem, which is good. It also does a great job of helping the high-level language programmer understand how their programming language constructs translate into assembly instructions and actually take place. I have never seen a good explanation of that outside of articles by disassemblers and reverse engineers, but every programmer ought to know these concepts because it may come in handy when debugging some day.
But although it serves as an excellent introduction to the material, it is on the thin side (500 pages) for the hefty textbook price it wields. It's just not comprehensive, nor does it have any practical programming lessons for the reader. Unlike my college textbook above, which was used for a two semester senior-level course, this textbook just doesn't cover what I want (a practical guide to using assembly in the field, as opposed to just in the classroom). I don't think it's thorough enough for a comprehensive college course in the subject. When you finish the book, you may understand assembly, but you won't know what to do with it (or what you can do with it). Nor is it thorough enough to be used as a reference material for work. It omits quite a few processor instructions that I feel are important to know for reference.
My advice is to pass on this book, unless you are completely new to the material, because it seems like a good learning text. Even still, you will eventually need a more authoritative reference guide for when you encounter the things this book doesn't cover (such as interfacing the PC hardware).
Intel's ""Software Developers Manuals"" are freely available at their site in PDF, and I would suggest downloading all of those as your reference and purchasing Mazidi's book (now in fourth edition and NOT outdated anymore) for a few bucks more than this one.",54
Riccardo Audano,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bioinformatics: A Primer,Finely assembled,"Great starting point for learning 32 bits assembly language with
DOS and Windows. The only defect of this book is its unbelievable price... surely due to the fact that is used a college textbook so the poor students have no choice but squander their savings on it. Luckily the content is very good,
the teaching style is excellent ( the author uses macros initially to do input and output so you won't be overwhelmed by lots of material just to write and read from the keyboard, and after you have played a bit a learned the basics he goes on explaining them). You can certainly read this book with no prior exposure to assembly and computer inner workings.
You 'better have at least some exp with a high level language,
and if you don't, why on earth do you want to start programming with assembly? Masochisms?

If you need to understand how assembly works to write shell code I would highly reccomend this book. The section on understanding the stack is very useful to understand how to exploit applications and why these exploits work. The only drawback that I see to this book is the price, it is very expensive. I feel that ASM is a pretty highly specialized area which justifies the price.",4

Michael T Kennedy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Life Decoded: My Genome, My Life (Penguin Press Science)",Bigger than life,"Having read The Genome War, I had preordered Venter's own story. I was not disappointed. The Publisher's Weekly review sniffs that it is ""clumsily written."" I would attribute that opinion to one of two possibilities. Either the reviewer never got beyond the early chapters about his childhood, which are marred by cliche and some amateurish prose, or the reviewer does not know enough biology to understand the rest. Once past the early biography, the rest of the book is riveting. I would warn those considering it that a reasonable knowledge of biology and genetics is almost a requirement to enjoy the story. I teach medical students and have studied molecular biology (unknown when I was a medical student) and it taxed my knowledge to the limit to understand his accomplishments. Still, the book reminds me a bit of ""Science Fictions,"" the account of the discovery of the AIDS virus, which pulled no punches in naming villains and fakers. Venter is settling a few scores but, having read the other book, I am inclined to accept his version of the story. Biology research is not beanbag, to paraphase an old aphorism, especially when the stakes are high. There are titanic egos in this story, not just that of the author. If you like biology and genetics and want to read about the biggest big game hunt in biological science history, this is a good place to start.

The best part of the story begins as he returns from Vietnam, a near failure in high school, now stimulated by his experiences as a corpsman to study and go to medical school. He has married a New Zealand girl he met on R&R in Australia. They both go to UCSD once they have mastered junior college. Here he becomes interested in biochemistry, then cell biology. He is the beneficiary of the interest of a noted cell biologist who likes his story and encourages him to do research. Eventually, this leads to a PhD only seven years after his return from the war. He goes on to a medical school faculty position, gradually building his research credentials until he is invited to join the NIH.

He tells the story of his research into the nature of the adrenaline receptor, the link that allows the hormone to stimulate the heart to beat faster and more powerfully. From there, he begins to study the genetics of the receptor. From there, he climbs the path to world fame and meets some nasty surprises in fellow scientists whose personal ambition cancels their devotion to science. I highly recommend this book to those with some background in biology and genetics. He tries to simplify for a broader audience but the subject is still complex. I read the book in two days, actually taking longer than I might with another non-fiction book because it requires concentration and some rereading to understand the details. The science, not the author, is the hero here and it takes some time to understand it all.",144
Nancyhua,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Life Decoded: My Genome, My Life (Penguin Press Science)","Fortune, like all women, favors the bold","I started reading this autobiography alongside The Genome War and found it to be a great complement. Venter had a whole career before starting on the human genome- his book is more than half over before he relates an incident brought up 15% of the way through Shreeve's.

Most of this book is about his work, the seemingly unavoidable politics of navigating schemes that opposed his work, and then a little about sailing. Venter had the vision and confidence to lead teams of people towards large goals that took years to achieve. Due to his biochemist training, he was attentive to detail and got unprecedented results partly due to painstakingly verifying manufacturer's claims. While his ability to execute on a long term plan and attend to detail seemed surprising for someone who was a bad high school student, throughout his life he consistently displayed a highly competitive, risk seeking nature, which allowed him to be the game changer in his field. A top performer, he seems to fixate on and draw motivation from opposition and criticims. Aside from Venter's boldness and drive, the only personality that comes out is that of a cartoonishly devious and somewhat stupid Watson.

The concepts are easy to understand but Venter emphasizes that biological ideas are cheap- the devil's in the details, a perhaps obvious statement that helped to drive me away from biology ages ago because it's so complex, just one thing after another. Despite innovating towards using sophisticated computing and robotic technology, something like 10-90% of the machines would be broken on any given day, and Venter describes endless other implementational headaches to get the necessary data.

This inspirational account of doggedly pursuing one's vision also reveals a depressing aspect of the current scientific world where mediocrity is incentivized and innovation difficult without significant ego. Modern scientists seem to have to choose between acclaim (ultimately in the form of the Nobel prize) and money (by disappearing into industry and branded as opposed to sharing work, regardless of whether they actually share data or not). This obsession with the Nobel prize makes me consider the motivations of the great scientists of yore like Newton, who obviously never received these prizes, and reveals that humans are naturally competitive- if we can't compete over money then we compete over recognition. The myth of the tenured genius like Mendel bumbling about with experiments so far ahead of their time as to have no immediate use is not a beneficial model when generally applied. Balancing the slow, beurocratic, often ineffective, resource draining motions of modern academia with the perhaps shortsighted, globally suboptimal greed of industry illustrates a question encountered in many spheres.",2
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Life Decoded: My Genome, My Life (Penguin Press Science)","Craig told me about his book, so I had to read it!","I was relaxing on my boat after a day of sailing, enjoying a beer, while I watched this bald guy park his big power boat in the marina slip next to mine. He looked like the new guy in the marina, so I called out ""looks like moving day!"" He said it was, so I walked over and introduced myself. He told me his name was Craig, and as I did a double-take, I asked him if he was Craig Ventner. He politely corrected me and said ""Venter."" Wow! I told him how my wife and I saw the Discovery show ""Decoding the Oceans"", and asked him where Sorcerer II was, and he told me she was on a new expedition. There I was having a neighborly conversation with my new neighbor - a real live superstar! (I'm an engineer, sort of a nerd, so to me Craig is a superstar). I'm also a CEO and I enjoy reading about successful people. Armand Hammer, Chuck Yeager, Lee whatshisname, The Donald's ""Art of the Deal"", so I was intrigued when Craig suggested that I read his book ""Decoding Life"" to learn more about genomics. So, I did. Just finished it in fact. Couldn't put it down. Anyway, I left Craig to finish cleaning up his boat and went to pick up the pizza that I had ordered. On my way back, as I walked through the marina parking lot, what do I see?...a beautiful black Tesla roadster, and I immediately know who owns it. Back on the dock, as I walked past Craig, where he is sorting his dock lines, I ask ""hey Craig, is that your Tesla up there in the parking lot?"" Of course it's his. I knew it. He loves it, all electric hotrod, so fast it scares him, he says. So, naturally I offer to share my pizza with him, since its around dinner time now. Craig smiles and says the offer is tempting, but his wife is waiting at home for him, and we part. So, back on my boat, I'm so excited, I call my wife to tell her I just met Craig Venter, no Venter, not Ventner. As I'm talking to my wife I hear a knock on my boat, and guess who hands me a bottle of wine? Thanks Craig, I say, as I tell my wife Craig Venter just came by and offered me a bottle of wine he had left in the cooler on his boat.

Craig is one of us. He belongs to us. He is a National Treasure. Our brother that we share 99.5% of our DNA with, and he is of the most gifted human beings of our time. I'm thrilled and honored to have met him because its not every day you meet a guy like that with a mind so creative and flexible to be able to solve one of mankind's most complex puzzles, and yet be so thoughtful and warm a human being. Thanks Craig, I raise my glass and toast you, may your CETP gene help you live long and prosper!

I'm wrong? ..Trotsky"".
If you read the copy of Fred Sanger's handwritten note ""...I was interested to see how far it is possible to go with the shot gun approach"". Notice Fred didn't say ""your shot gun approach"".
It is a bit bizarre to read a junior college graduate claim credit for something Fred Sanger developed over 40 years. Almost all of Sanger's methods used random to get order. His homochromatography 2nd dimension for RNA sequencing used random degradation of RNA to make one RNA polymer of each size to separate labeled oligonucleotides. His used the random ends of DNA polymerase precessionto make synthesized complementary DNA of each size to be resynthesized to the complementary nucleotide in the plus-minus system. He used the random insertion of dideoxynucleotides vs deoxynucleotides for the Sanger dideoxy sequencing method. He used random degradation of DNA fragments to shot-gun in all pieces of his target sequence into the f1-like ssDNA vector to create single strands from double strands to use his primed synthesis of sequencing. PhiX 174 and
Human mitochondria was sequenced by the ""shot-gun"" method before Venter ""invented"" it.
In addition, his ignorance of how acrylamide gels first allowed the automation of DNA sequences is profound. B.J. Davis in Len Ornstein's lab at Mt.Sinai NY, showed that high molecular weight RNA could be resolved into very fine bands using methylene blue staining. Their student went to Sanger's lab and resolved and fingerprinted 5S RNA into bands separated by 1 nucleotide at 125, 126, 127, 128 nucleotides and demonstrated the resolution up to 700 nucleotides. That changed Sanger's sequencing from 2 dimensions to 1 dimension. That is the only thing that allowed for the automation of DNA sequencing. That student also showed that non-cross-linked acrylamide linear polymer could give the same resolution. That allowed for capillary fractionation. So nothing Venter claims as his methodological invention is his. He just used other people's methods.
The monoclonals was also first invented by that same student and was specifically suggested to Cesar Milstein so that Argentina's only Nobel laureate would be Jewish. This was not a trivial consideration in that most of the nazi's left to Argentina, some aided by the Vatican Rat line and British intelligence i.e. Mengele, inter alia.
That same student then went on to invent combinatorial chemistry using Sanger logic of using random nucleotide sequence not to make one of each size but one of each type. That he presented to another Professor of his Bruce Merrifield.
And the method and use of making a vector from f1 for sequencing and display he presented to his other professor Norton Zinder, now in the Hebrew Home of the Aged, who has not received the recognition from Venter for giving him any of his scientific credibility to get this sequencing project off the ground.
This student also brought combinatorial chemistry to Wally Steinberg for funding when he was fronting mob money in Jersey City, NJ. Wally said ""change your name ..it is too long"".
That student also saved Gerry Rubin's career at the MRC.
Venter proves that the NIH is there to steal projects from extra mural scientists submitting grants. The idea and method of sequencing the whole genome was presented to Elke Jordon in 1975 by that same student, with a casette of the PhX 174 sequence as music. She also defended Szybalski as an NIH reviewer even though he made Weigl typhus vaccine for the Waffen SS in Lwov during WWII. The DNA music is something that Venter also claims to have invented in his book, but it is the smoking gun to prove he stole ideas, methods and financing. Wonder what he really did in Nam..saving lives or killing them with the arrogance of ignorance.
I do like his trashing Hazeltine, who patented proteins which didn't exist for HGSI and who blocked that student's AIDs vaccine and treatment. Also, now Venter misses the point on his synthetic biology. His bioinformatics and evolutionary arguments are only by alignment and not by combinatorials of patterns. But that is another story for another student t.",3

Venter, on the other hand seems to have a Christ complex, while ignoring the fact that the DNA that has made him so succesful MUST have been created by an outside intelligence. Understanding DNA should lead a person to a greater sense of humility and awe. Venter may have some insights into DNA that most do not, but seems to act as if he were the creator of DNA. Overall the book was weak and centered completely on Venter's ego.",1
Y. Leventhal,5.0 out of 5 stars,DNA Is Here to Stay,Interesting book,"I read this book to my children the same evening I got all the children's books on genes. Frankly, when I finished reading this one, I thought to myself that this book was a bit dense--probably best suited for 10 and up and only those scientifically inclined. The information is accurate, but the language is a bit ""stiff"" (dry like a science journal) and there is a lot of repetition (perhaps as a way of drilling the concepts into children). We also bought a couple of other books by the same author and all of these books have overlapping sections. After a couple of books, I got tired of the constant repetition.
Had I logged on and put in a review then, I might have given the book 3 stars. But, when I put my kids to bed, my 5 year old said to me, with a naughty smile on his face, ""It is not fair--girls get two X's and boys only get one X."" So I said to him that he's got something girls don't have-what is that? He replied, ""The Y!""
I have to admit I was impressed--with my son as well as with the book. Dry the book may sound to me, somehow it manages to impart some very important information and makes the information interesting and accessible to a 5 year old. For that, I think my money is well spent.",6
LLS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Family History in the Genes: Trace your DNA and grow your family tree,DNA Studies,"This book is better than the first one by Chris.
It is more up to date and seems a little easier
to read. I would make Family History in the Genes
a recommended reading for those interested in DNA
as part of their genealogy research.",5
Danny Miller,3.0 out of 5 stars,Next Generation Sequencing Technologies and Challenges in Sequence Assembly (SpringerBriefs in Systems Biology),"Good for beginners, avoid if you have bioinformatics experience","I'll keep it pretty short (like this book). I'm a PhD student who does some bioinformatics work. I read the book thinking I'd gain more insight into challenge in sequence assembly (kind of like the title says), but really didn't. This book is a very high-level overview of next-gen sequencing.

If you know the difference between a MiSeq and a HiSeq then avoid this book. If you're new to the NGS world (either assembly or alignment) and need a foundation to build on then this is a good book for you.",3
Elaine Holley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Medical Informatics: Practical Guide for the Healthcare Professional 2007,"Order 2008 or 2009 edition, not this one","The content breadth and commentary are the best I've seen.

The authors point out that only an E-Book and constant updates can be most effective for the subject churn pace, and indeed, at [...] a 2008 ""second"" edition is available at less cost.",4
Kruse,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Encyclopedia of Genetics, Genomics, Proteomics, and Informatics (Springer Reference)",TOO MUCH!!!,"I really wanted this book. I'm tired of spending hours looking up terms and everything for my research and other classes. Unfortunately, amazon wants a whopping $799 for it when it is listed as $40 else where. Amazon, you really need to fix your random price generator because this is bad! I ended up buying the book through amazon from another seller. How can a book go from $40 to $799 on sale?!

Re-edit: I bought these books from a different source for $40 and it is one of the best buys I have made. Some of the information is out of date (ex. epigenetics deffinition). Only an extremely small portion though that I can find so far. Everything else is AMAZING. If you need a genetics reference this is fantastic, but the price is way too high.

For the books if I could I would give them 6 stars!!!

For the price, only 1 star. Very few people could actually afford this item at the price amazon is asking. This is from the perspective of a graduate student.",2
"Eric ""Siggy"" Scott",3.0 out of 5 stars,Bioinformatics: An Introduction (Computational Biology),Not what I expected,"To those who (like me) think of bioinformatics as a set of tools used to study large-scale genetic and proteomic data, this book feels a little bit out of place. Its emphasis is on big-picture theory -- specifically, the rôle played by information theory in biology. It is not very unified -- for example the extensive theoretical ideas developed in the first part rarely make an appearance in part III, ""applications.""

The flavor of the book is perhaps best summed up by the following comparison. In Ramsden we find:

A) ~80 pages on information theory, probability, and complexity.
B) ~25 pages pages on sequence databases, alignment algorithms, and phylogeny.
C) ~5 pages on protein folding/structure/function prediction and drug discovery.

Compare to Lesk's Introduction to Bioinformatics:

A) ~8 pages.
B) ~129 pages.
C) ~90 pages.

Ramsden's approach reminds me of high-level, grandioise complexity science books (ex. Érdi's Complexity Explained or Mitchell's Complexity: A Guided Tour). To Ramsden, bioinformatics is not a set of tools but rather the more general study of ""deviations from randomness"" in the genome.

This sort of discussion can be very enlightening, and is important for developing a personal research world view. His discussions of information theory, for instance, helped give me a wider appreciation for the meaning and importance it has in science at large.

However, his big-picture discussion left precision by the wayside, and it wasn't always possible to determine what he meant as he hopped fleetingly from discussing the definitions of microstates/macrostates/KL-divergence to vaguely referring to the Shannon Index as ""remembered information"" and its quantity as the ""intensity of selection,"" and later discussing the ""durability of information."" All these analogies are swell, but they are not defined with any degree of precision, and so the possible interpretations of what the author means are underdetermined by the text.

I suppose that is to say that the book, while chalked full of mathematical equations and concepts, is at times difficult to follow for its lack of rigor. More than once I wrote ""WTF?"" in the margin.

This does not mean it is worthless, and many researchers who have a sharp interest in unifying theory can probably find value in it while developing their own vista on what biological information should be and how it relates to probability theory.

While sections of this book are good and stand-alone introductions to basic concepts of information theory, molecular biology, and bioinformatics tools, this book is not a practical introduction to the tools and methods of bioinformatics as it is practiced on a regular basis. For that, read Lesk, or for a more mathematically rigorous (if outdated) treatment, see Waterman's (Introduction to Computational Biology: Maps, Sequences and Genomes.",3
wiredweird,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Ten Most Wanted Solutions in Protein Bioinformatics (Chapman & Hall/CRC Mathematical and Computational Biology),Depends on what you want,"This book delivers reasonably well on the promise in its title: it does a good job in stating the most computational interesting problems relating to proteins. It assumes the reader knows a little about biochemistry, biology, and computational techniques, but only a little about each. Given that base, it does a fair job in describing problems related to protein structure, function, analysis, and design. It's not an advanced text, in either its computational or biological sides, but not an elementary introduction, either. Someone a bit above novice level will probably get the most out of it.

A few things left me a bit leery about this text, though. Despite its 2005 copyright date, the author (p.53) cites an estimate of human 50,000 genes. I'm not sure where (or when) that number comes from, because most estimates today are closer to 30,000. There was another a minor annoyance in the discussion of convolution as a tool in protein docking. The failure to distinguish convolution from correlation is minor and forgivable. Saying that one ""convolutes"" a convolution is like say that one ""revolutes"" a revolution. Revolve: revolution, convolve: convolution. Also, the Fourier transform step in correlation, especially when docking a small molecule to a protein, is an optimization rather than a requirement. Transform-based correlation gives better performance for asymptotically large models. In some computing environments, for models of realistic sizes, the simplicity of direct correlation gives a performance advantage - and allows non-linear scoring algorithms that would be impossible with the transform approach.

This is a fair introduction to many of the ways people study proteins computationally, and to the kinds of tools required. There is very little computaitonal detail, however. It may help a tool-builder create a conceptual base for studying proteins, but won't help much with the specific calculations.

Allan M. Lees,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Ten Most Wanted Solutions in Protein Bioinformatics (Chapman & Hall/CRC Mathematical and Computational Biology),Comprehensive but a little dated,"This is a very useful overview of the very broad subject of bioinformatics, and it provides a good background on a variety of approaches to topics like protein conformation prediction. The translation is excellent - the subject-matter is clear and there are no obvious errors, which is unusual for such a technical subject. The main drawback of the book is that, because this is a field in which progress is being made rapidly, the book is already out of date in places. For example, in the chapter dealing with protein structure prediction, there is scant mention of the most successful approach to date, namely the Rosetta project initiated at the University of Washington in Seattle.

Nevertheless, this is a very useful primer for people coming into the area of bioinformatics and it covers topics that will not age as rapidly, such as certain statistical models. Indeed, the author's exposition of how Hidden Markov Models work is as clear as anything I've read anywhere.",4
William J. Egan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Scan Statistics: Methods and Applications (Statistics for Industry and Technology),Excellent book,"An truly wonderful treatment of the statistics of scans (clusters of events in some window of time and/or space). The first half of the book walks through applications & formulas, the second half adds hard-core details, proofs, etc. It is well written and contains many good examples with copious references to primary literature.
This book is far better than Runs and Scans with Applications by N. Balakrishnan and M. Koutras, which I judge to be an effort to impress the reader with how well the authors can write convoluted
statistical proofs rather than actually teach the reader something useful, a tendency in statistical texts which I despise.",10
