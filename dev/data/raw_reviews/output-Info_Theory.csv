Tao Xu,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,thought provoking but biased,"It is a thought provoking book, covering 5 tribes of supervised learning, a bit of unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning and other stuff like chunking and relational learning, etc. It has lots of speculations about the master algorithm which could learn everything. The climax of the book is the circled map of master algorithm. For each topic, it talks about the most important ideas, algorithms and applications, and how are they connected with other tribes. It also emphasize a few common principals: overfit, curse of dimensionality, explore and exploitation, structure learning and parameters learning, etc. The author is very good at explaining in a few simple sentences the gist of an advance algorithm e.g. TD(lambda) and value function approximation in reinforcement learning, message passing, MCMC and Kalman filtering in bayesian, etc.

The author is a bit biased, perhaps 80+% Bayesian, claiming Markov Logic Network is the secret ingredient of master algorithm. I found that part the most unsatisfactory in book, not convinced by the arguments.",65
ajay gupta,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,A book for no one in particular,I picked up this book because it was on the recommended list from Bill Gates. The book starts out well in terms on framing the different approaches to machine learning but the author fails to communicate why a certain approach excels. This book is neither for non-professional machine learner nor for an amateur machine learner nor for a professional in any of the different branches of machine learning. Feels like introductory chapter of Author's PhD thesis expanded unnecessarily.,6
Shankar Saikia,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,Awesome and Unique Comprehensive Yet Readable Overview of ML,"AWESOME OVERVIEW OF ML IDEAS

I have read a few textbooks on machine learning (intro to Statistical Learning by Hastie etc) and so I would say that my knowledge of ML is at the ""textbook overview"" level. Since I am not a ML practitioner, I may not be the best judge of a book such as this one, it was a fairly difficult read, and I know I need to read the book a second time to get an even greater appreciation and understanding of the concepts covered by the author. That being said, it was a very enjoyable book. The book was very different from any ML book that I've read or checked out either at a bookstore or online. I think one needs to have some knowledge of ML to appreciate the book - concepts like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, Bayesian inference, support vector machines, neural networks, etc .... The book deserves a 5-star rating because it added a lot of value to my understanding of ML, and increased my desire and curiosity to learn more about the field of ML ....",3
Chema Ballarin,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,"Great start, lost me at some point, gained me back at the end.","Took me a while to decide whether to give three or four stars. On one side, the book explains the five schools of thought to machine learning and does with great detail. On the other hand, after starting off with an adequate level (from my view anyway, I hold a masters degree in telecom engineering) it became more and more obscure, to the point where I found myself skipping some of the explanations in the last chapters hoping to come to the end where the author would recap and resume it all in clearer terms. I guess the matter is complex enough that requires careful reading, meaning re-reading chapters two, three times and often coming back to where you started to feel lost. That's my only critique and considering it may be my lack of energy to do this, I think it well deserves four stars.
The author definitely gained me back at the last chapter, a good resume of what AI and machine learning means, what isn't and what holds for the future. The recommended readings chapter is full of materials to keep learning, which i might do as this is one of the few areas today where everything can still be done.",1

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,"Not helpful to understand the current state of machine learning. More of a ""dream definition"" of Domingos than anything practica","Not good. Mr. Domingos clearly knows a lot about machine learning, but he is on his personal hunt for something that doesn't exist yet, what he calls the master algorithm which is supposed to unify all the techniques of machine learning into a single algorithm. The whole book is his trying to sell his idea of this non-existent master algorithm as something that does exist, and just needs to be found.

The byline on the book from Walter Sara son says ""Domingos demystifies machine learning"", which made me expect this would be a book that helps educate on the basics of machine learning (as they exist) and its implementations and uses.

A. Menon,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,Good overview of machine learning techniques for non-expert but overall a mixed book,"The Master Algorithm is a reasonable overview of the growing field of machine learning. The author explores the idea of there being a master algorithm which could explain everything given enough data. The idea seems a bit over the top when initially phrased but the real purpose of the book is to introduce ideas used in machine learning and how they work and are used to solve problems.

The book is split into multiple chapters which start from discussing abstractly the master algorithm and then move on to some of the philosophical issues associated with using such algorithms. In particular the author discusses at the core of believing in pattern recognition algorithms is belief in inductive reasoning. The author discusses human learning and gets into some neuroscience and how neural networks are constructed. The reader gets a vague sense of Hebbian learning and how neuron weighting are at the core of neural networks. The author spends a lot of time discussing various approaches in machine learning and gives the reader an intuitive feel of Bayesian learning. The author was an originator in a particular algorithm called naïve Bayes which greatly simplified solutions to certain problems and so the author introduces his ideas to the reader. Other machine learning ideas are introduced like genetic programming and multivariable regression. The author also discusses other machine learning algorithms which turn data into a vector and then look for close neighbors of the vector to classify the input. The author also spends some time on how unsupervised learning would look. The book combines computer science ideas and intuition and tries to use a fictitious robot as the means to convey ideas about how a computer would learn. The author finally introduces his own master algorithm called alchemy which combines most of the models described in the book. The reader really gets little actual sense of what's going on in the algorithm as the author qualifies one needs a PhD in computer science.

The Master Algorithm is the first book I have seen which introduces some of the ideas being used in machine learning to a general audience. It does so quite well and most of the ideas are absorbable. At the same time there are a few too many instances where the author is self promoting talking about all of the brilliant ideas he has had which have reshaped the field and how other areas of AI research of the past or Kurzweil and his singularity concept are idiotic. Despite probably being right in much of his analysis its arguing with no one on the other side and unproductive. Also the flavor of the writing is odd - it turns into some fantasy literature at times as though that makes the subject more digestible and in fact makes it more irritating. I enjoyed reading aspects of the book and do think the parts on what different schools of machine learning focus on are well written for a non expert, unfortunately there are many other parts of the book which one wants to get through as quickly as possible.",4
Joey Velez-Ginorio,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,He presents useful and concise interpretations of the different learning tribes (Connectionists,"As an undergraduate researcher in Machine Learning, this book was quite the eye-opener. I'd say that for starters, if you're expecting this book to provide you with a sense of technical understanding on the vast scope of topics covered within, you're misinterpreting the intention. Rather, Pedro Domingos takes you on a journey throughout the history surrounding attempts at cracking the master algorithm. He presents useful and concise interpretations of the different learning tribes (Connectionists, Symbolists, etc.); noting their respective successes and failures. More notably, he concocts his own attempt at the master algorithm, an effort that by no means could be described anything less than luminary. That's the essence of this book in my eyes, to serve as an approachable starting point to understand the fundamentals surrounding a universal learner, and how not to repeat the transgressions of our past so as to eventually instantiate progress.",4

Denny,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,Okay Read for people in Machine Learning,"I'm giving this book 4 starts because it was entertaining read (especially the last chapter), and and because I found a few neat nuggets of knowledge about the connections between various Machine Learning concepts.

My issues with this book are:

1. It is not clear who the target audience is. It seems like this book is written for everyone and no one. As someone with a background in Machine Learning I would have preferred a few succinct formulas over paragraphs of explanation. For someone without any background in ML on the other hand the explanations won't make a lot of sense - they are full of technical jargon.

2. The book is clearly biased towards the author's own point of view and work. Of course that's unavoidable when you're writing a book, but you should at least let your readers know about it. The book is written/marketed as if it represents hard truths, not personal opinions.

3. For the topics I was intimately familiar with I found that the authors skims of a lot details and/or doesn't consider developments that address the problems he describes. I also found a few minor mistakes (no major ones). This makes me very skeptical about the sections on topics I am NOT familiar with, which are probably of similar depth.",3

Claude Forthomme (Nougat),5.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World,A Must Read for Anyone Interested in What Our Digital Future Looks Like,"A word of warning: I'm not a machine learning practitioner and not even mathematically inclined. I am merely an average person with a (reasonable) degree of culture (I suppose I classify as a sociologist) looking out to understand the world around me a little better.

Yet I loved this book, it opened my eyes on a world I suspected existed somewhere in the depths of my computer or when I did a Google search but that I never understood. If you are afraid to be engulfed in equations, don't be. The author prefers to use allegories and is very good at giving simple explanations, making everything (almost) crystal clear.

What you get is a comprehensive overview of where machine learning is going. This is hugely important, considering the sometimes disturbing news you get in the media - not just from Snowden but also from ""neurotechnologists"" who guide political campaigns by embedding cameras in ads, cameras that detect the viewers' reactions and then adjust the campaign in function of these reactions.

Perhaps my only quarrel with this book - but it does not detract from its excellence and the five stars I gave it - is the philosophical position taken by the author. I don't quite share his optimism about our robotic future. And this for 2 reasons:

One, the connection between learning algorithms and data. Domingos does note at the outset: ""...the more data they [the learners] have, the more intricate the algorithms can be."" So without ""big data"", you don't get ""good"" learning algorithms - the ""bigger"" the data, the better the algorithm. Or as Domingos writes, ""the more data we have, the more we can learn"". True enough. But what about the quality and size of the big data? What if the data is error-filled and we're not aware of it? Can machine learning be aware of something their human masters are not? On what basis? The algorithms are taught to deal with an imperfect world and draw the most likely conclusions, where ""most likely"" is highly subjective. Or at least, it is ""highly subjective"" in my opinion and I realize that it is only one opinion and not necessarily one shared by the author.

Two, the connection between you as you are and an expanded ""digital you"": a ""model"" of who you are, your work experience, your tastes, a model that the algorithm has learned - and thanks to algorithms, you will be able to do more things and faster than ever before. Domingos describes an extraordinary future where, for example, in your LinkedIn account, ""you'll immediately interview for every job in the universe that remotely fits your parameters (profession, location, pay, etc) LinkedIn will respond on the spot with a ranked list of the best prospects, and out of those, you'll pick the first company that you want to have a chat with. Same with dating: your model will go on millions of dates so you don't have to...""

Big time-saver obviously. But it comes at a cost: you have to give your parameters (stuff about your work, your likes and dislikes) to the algorithms. Ye who go digital, leave behind any notion of privacy...So users of this algorithmic landscape will have few shaded areas in which to hide.

But for me, privacy concerns aside (and I'm not that concerned, I have nothing to hide), there is yet another matter that I find more worrisome. Domingos (on p.283) tells us he is confident that the future can only get better: ""In fact, it's the systems that have a slight edge in serving us better that will, generation after generation, multiply and take over the gene pool."" Then he adds: ""Of course, if we're so foolish as to deliberately program a computer to put itself above us, then maybe we'll get what we deserve"".

Indeed. That is precisely my worry: can we be sure that there won't be a Doctor Evil who will do so? Can we be sure that there won't be an Apprentice Sorcerer who might end up doing this even if unintentionally? A mistake can happen...

So yes, I'm deeply worried about this algorithmic future and I don't share the author's unflagging optimism. But that doesn't mean it's a book you shouldn't read. On the contrary, it's a must read precisely because it raises all these fundamental questions about the future of humanity. And it is an easy read even for the non-cognoscenti like myself, I highly recommend the introductory chapters, and if you get bogged down in the middle with all the technicalities, no fear, skip to the last two chapters, they are well worth reading!",2

Ken Rider,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers, and Changemakers",Game On,"The authors deserve credit for pulling the content of this book together and organizing it in a way that is inviting and intuitive to read and browse. It's all about using games to help groups of people think about and address business challenges in creative ways. Although it has 8 chapters, Gamestorming really divides into two major sections: (1) an introductory set of chapters that define what games are, their key characteristics and skills for effective play and (2) an expansive collection of about 90 games, each with rules and strategy explained in one to three pages of text. The book concludes with a short example of how to put games to practical use.

PROS: Gamestorming is an engaging, one-of-a-kind resource for using games in business settings. The introduction and early chapters are well geared to those without much gaming background and do a good job explaining how games can be used to help groups define problems, clarify thinking, generate ideas and ID next steps. There is even a small section with simple drawing tips for illustrating ideas...a nice addition. The diverse selection of games, which appropriately fills more than three-quarters of the book, is applicable to a range of situations. Think of it like a collection of ""recipes"" for games, which good facilitators can follow exactly or adapt to their own needs. Purely as an idea book for business games, it would rate at least a ""4"" but there are a few things that make it less useful than it probably could be for some audiences.

CONS: The book is ambitiously written for ""the novice and the experienced practitioner alike,"" but appealing to everyone can be tough. Novice facilitators will like the intro but may find the later sections somewhat lite on game strategy. It's just hard in a few paragraphs to fully explain each game's flow or give newcomers much in the way of tips or trouble shooting to make a confident go of it. A beefed-up focus on ""how to"" might have been better for this group (those looking for a primer on facilitation may want to check out Kaner's ""Facilitator's Guide to Participatory Decision-Making""). By contrast, seasoned facilitators might want more nuance in other areas, like how to organize the rich info games generate for later use, so it isn't reduced to a bunch of meaningless sound bites -- a challenge with any brainstorming session. Finally, to round out its practical application, a few more examples or links showing how games can be used to solve real-life problems would help (see Daniel Hoang's Amazon review of Gamestorming, for several good online links).",115
Harish Nair,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers, and Changemakers","Good compilation, could have been more engaging","Dave does deserve a lot of credit for compiling the possible management activities into a book, which can act as a ready reckoner for some meeting. While I bought the Kindle edition, but I feel this should be bought as a hard copy and kept in the office for referencing.

What I liked was the logical sequencing of the events (with particular focus on opening an closing), the clarity with which the acitivities were laid out and the checkpoints to decide whether the particular event is suited for a particular outcome. While some of them were familiar, however, there were still some which were quite interesting. I found ""The Anti-Problem"" activity very interesting and would like to try it out whenever we are stuck in an issue next time. Brainwriting was another interesting activity as it helps to get the view points of all in the room and not just the vociferous ones. Pecha Kucha is also exciting and have already tried it out a couple of time (not knowing that it had a name, just that had a very limited time and had to cover various topics). And I got the first proper reference for an elevator pitch .

What didnt work for me was that most of the activities could not be categories as 'game' by any stretch of logic. e. g. SWOT analysis. And also it would have been more interesting if some real life examples would have been quoted rather than imaginary situation. Each activity could have been a short story, engaging the readers much more. In the current format, it remains a good compilation, but a bit of pain to go through.",1

It's always hard to be productive with sales, software development, support teams and other stakeholders in large meeting together.

I highly recommend this book to anyone leading cross-functional teams.",1
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers, and Changemakers",Variety of thinking games,"I found the first half of the book very insightful based on how likely it is that I could apply some of these ideas. There are many, many games to experiment with. I like that they are broken into conceptual groups rather than just a ton of random ideas. Each game in each group is design to focus thinking and experiment with ideas and products in a fairly simple way. Best of all, the games are fairly short and easy to grasp. Each is very much set up like a game. The formats are consistent, and each begins with the object of play and ends with the strategy.

It really can help in many companies and departments I have worked...with the expectation of course that you will be able to get each persons participation and open-minded thinking. Often I have seen people shut down before the exercises begin. I have done that myself for different reasons. I am always open to new perspectives and trying to find what I am missing in my thinking. I don't like participating in games where management is just trying to improve their metrics (I really hate that corporate word) by manipulating you into agreeing with them so their numbers look better. That is not what this book about. It will open you eyes, and help you go down new and interesting paths to better development in many areas.",2
LUCK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers, and Changemakers",Want More Productive Meetings? Use Game Storming.,"In our Management Consulting practice, we frequently have to facilitate meetings with executives, sales people, call center agents and IT professionals. Using standard Q&A formats as laborious for the attendees, often leaving them open to distractions, and can result in losing focus. The methods outlined in Game Storming are great tools to speed up meetings, keep attendees highly engaged, extract better decisions and clearer requirements.

Word of warning - it takes a lot more prep time to pull together meetings like this. Game Storming is not something to pull out the day before a meeting. On the other hand, you will find that your follow-up after the meeting is much more efficient.",2
Veronica Heltne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers, and Changemakers","Wow, was I positively surprised!","For me, the word ""gamestorming"" sounds a lot like ""brainstorming"". So when I came across Gamestorming, I thought it was a book describing yet another technique to generate ideas. As such, Gamestorming didn't seem that interesting to me.

Some months later I discovered that (co-author) Dave was teaching ""Gamestorming"" at a conferences I was planning to attend. I thought a workshop would be a much better way to teach me how to use this new technique (rather than reading a whole book about the topic), so I signed up. And then, thinking it could be a little advantageous to actually read the book beforehand, ended up buying the book as well.

Wow, was I positively surprised when I got the book and quickly browsed the pages. I realized that Gamestorming was a reference guide of various workshop techniques, many of which I've known and used for years. Affinity map, card sorting, dot voting, post-up, storybord, brainstorming and poster session are all ""games"" I have taught or ""played"" with various clients and colleagues. I just thought of them as techniques or tools, although it makes sense to call them games. After all, using gamestorming in workshops and meetings is fun. And the exiting part: Now I have a whole book full of new games to try out! (Hopefully, there will be even more games added in future editions.)

Btw, I quite liked the first three chapters of the book, the ones that summarizes the game world evolution, the essentials for using gamestorming and the core gamestorming skills. It made me realize there are several ways to improve the outcome and usefulness of playing the games, even the ones I've known for years.

P.S. Gamestorming was so enjoyable that I ended up reading most of it before attending the workshop. Still, the hands-on workshop was of great value, especially the part covering the visual language and the bodystorming session. And I did get Dave to sign my copy, a nice little workshop memory.",3
Michael A Dila,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers, and Changemakers",Why games matter,"In Gamestorming, Dave Gray and his colleagues Sunni Brown & James Macanufo do something extraordinarily important and they do it with such simplicity and clarity that it is easy to miss what is most valuable about this book: in short, it explains why the idea of the game matters.

It has become a media commonplace, at least in the ""smart"" media of Wired, Fast Company, The New Yorker and the New York Times, that games and gaming are reshaping our world. Few, however, explain with such lucidity not only why we should pay attention to this phenomenon, but also give us such a practical roadmap to the application of what we have to learn.

Games are structured accelerators for learning. They are extraordinarily effective technologies for learning in groups and for accomplishing things while we learn and not simply after the fact. What Gray, Brown & Macanufo help us to see (the drawings & diagrams are fabulous) is that the game matters because it puts in our hands the technology to create and to explore other worlds, other realities; some possible, some parallel, some fantastical, but all of which are places that allow us to get beyond the constraints and the limitations of the present and the ordinary or mundane.

Gamestorming gives us both a roadmap for understanding why games matter so much and, as the authors properly say, an accessible ""playbook"" for how to use these powerful technologies.

My most grave complaint is that Gamestorming is still a book. Not withstanding the effort to challenge the limitations of the book (see the website at [...]), Gamestorming strains to show us things that belong on another platform altogether, perhaps something like the gamelayer that is starting to be built on top of the world we now ""know"": isn't that the ""place"" we should all go gamestorming?",2
V. Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers, and Changemakers",A variety of tools for a variety of people,"The authors have provided a valuable resource for helping individuals and groups figure out their own stories and share them. Your story may be a problem or your take on solving a problem. The diverse tools in this book provide a wealth of ways to dig in, collaborate and find out what's happening so you can work together (or on yourself) to reach your goals.

At first the book reminded me of some training games, which I am challenged to understand without reading them over several times, because there are no pictures. Gamestorming is different because it provides simple drawings spread throughout the book. I'm glad to see that the introductory chapters provide a brief visual language section.

I've already used the Empathy Map several times at the office, helping to 'get inside the head' of people my team needs to talk with about important issues. I've taught one other person to use it too. The 7P's framework for meeting planning is now a resource in a training course I'm developing. I love the metaphor for determining the purpose for a meeting, specifically, answering the question, ""What's on fire?"". This one step could save us from many a wasted hour on meetings that never deserved to happen. Happily, I have now learned how to do the 5 Why's exercise properly. Sketching the activities goes a long way to quickly engage your colleagues, friends, family or others.

Although most of the exercises are designed for small groups, there are some you can do on your own too. While so many books out there are full of other people's stories, here's one that teaches you how to find your own using a variety of tools that will help you engage a variety of people.",2
Luke A. Wissmann,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers, and Changemakers",A Facilitator's Dream,"This book was written for individuals at all levels of the enterprise to show different collaboration tools for organizations of all types to bring out creative solutions. The book is clearly written, uses clear examples and is well written and organized.

The authors do an excellent job of providing an introduction and background on the use of brainstorming games, which they call ""gamestorming"". Chapter 1 describes the objectives of games and suggests a solid approach for the facilitator. Chapter 2 lists the 10 essential components of a game and Chapter 3 discusses some skills required for effective facilitation. These chapters provide a foundation that allows for a rapid understanding of how the games should flow, how to structure the information, and how to ensure good results.

The remaining five chapter discuss a multitude of brainstorming games to solve many of the problems that an organization faces, which are often best solved through a collaborative effort. I've made slight adaptations to these games to suit my own style and solve client problems in a very smooth and professional way. Best wishes on your path to a new type of gaming!",1

Cristian Guajardo Garcia,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers, and Changemakers","Gamestorming, review en español","Como ya he dicho en innumerables ocasiones., la ""ampolleta"" como iconografía de una idea, es el favor más flaco que se le ha hecho a la creatividad.
Las ideas jamás llegan de la nada; son consecuencia de un ""mood"" de un estado mental que siempre está rondando el problema que enfrentamos. Sólo así, y cuando menos lo esperamos, ""se prende la ampolleta"". Sin embargo esto sólo sucede tras un intenso proceso mental exploratorio.

""Gamestorming"" es un libro hecho para todos aquellos que gustamos de las ideas, la creatividad y la innovación que viene consigo.
El libro, parcelado en 80 juegos distintos busca estimular nuestra forma de pensar para que podamos abordar diversos desafíos.

Lo que más me gustó de la propuesta, es la sencillez con que se expone cada juego, el tipo de problema que busca resolver y una metodología bastante clara.

El libro deja claro desde un principio los objetivos que se buscan cumplir:

- Superar conflictos y aumentar el compromiso con juegos orientados al trabajo e equipo.
- Mejorar la colaboración y comunicación entre miembros de equipos multi-disciplinario.
- Entender la posición y mind set de clientes, colegas y experiencia de usuario a través de juegos de rol.
- Generar más y mejores ideas rápido.

Si bien hay más objetivos, debo decir desde ya que todos se logran con holgura.
Los juegos están ordenados y jerarquizados de acuerdo a lo que se quiere lograr, de esta forma es más fácil entenderlos e implementarlos.
La mayoría (por no decir todos) son sumamente sencillos de ejecutar y por lo general, usan mucho los post it, plumones y otros elementos de fácil acceso.

""Gamestorming"" está bien pensado y resuelto. Fomenta el pensamiento divergente, exploratorio y convergente. Así es imposible fallar.
Recomiendo mezclar el libro con ""Business Model Generation"", el cual está ilustrado en uno de los juegos, pero por su importancia y variables, merece lectura aparte. A eso, agreguen ""Thinkertoys""

Many of the 'games' in this book are really activities that you probably already do in your job.

Chris H,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers, and Changemakers","Activites for Groups, would be a better title","""Gamestorming"" seemed to be chosen as the title of this book because the authors encourage the use of games for the purpose of ""brainstorming"" (i.e., generating ideas). I find this to be a noble goal because elements of games are underutilized in realms of business, education, etc. However...

Calling the activities presented in the book ""games"" stretches any definition of the word (which they never define, nor do they formally define gamestorming). The activities that are presented do have rules (maybe ""directions"" would have been a better word), but lack an objective/goal to make them actual games. For example, ""To let leadership understand and be responsive to any and all questions around the topic"" (p. 181) is an example of a goal of one of the games in the book. I understand that games are difficult to define, but that goal does not sound like the goal of a game, nor does it sound very fun.

That said, the activity in question (""Help Me Understand"") is one that I plan on trying during my first day of class this semester. So if you can get beyond the nomenclature you will find a book with interesting activities for organizing meetings or other groups of people.

Final nit-pick. The book indicates the virtues of iteration in many examples, but never includes iteration as an important attribute of the ""games"" they create.",51

MJR,4.0 out of 5 stars,Database Design for Mere Mortals: A Hands-On Guide to Relational Database Design (3rd Edition),Good book with some common-sense tips,"First off, this book is well-written. Mr. Hernandez does a good job of explaining the ""why"" behind his explanations. He also provides tips that just seem to make sense. He advises that a table have a name that is plural, because each record is one ""instance"" of the data related to the table. As an example, a table called CarColors would have several rows, each containing one car color.

My only real criticisms are:

1. That he did not go enough into effectively indexing, applying primary/foreign keys, and applying constraints.
2. There was not enough discussion of the various ""normalized"" forms, when they should be used, and so forth. This is covered in a ""flyover"" manner that makes sense, but perhaps a more ""in-depth"" discussion of normalized forms is beyond the scope of the book.

Some specific praise: First, the book bridged the gap between administrative needs (or in my case, general concept) and logical design. How do we get from those notes and vague understanding of the administrative environment to a specific design? This book helps. Second, it give the reader a basic understanding of the terminology. Third, it explains relationships. Finally, it provides a methodology (constructing table descriptions and field specifications) for creating tight data structures.

Some advice: Get the 1st edition of this book and a couple others (like ""The Absolute Beginner's Guide to Relational Databases"") and learn the general concepts for as little money as possible. Supplement these books with one good new book that's specific to your RDBMS, and you're off and running. (At least, that's my approach, and it's working for me -- a n00b with a limited R&D budget.)

Most of us will probably not follow his advice, though.

If you do decide to follow his advice, then be prepared for a very lengthy trip when designing your DBs. I tried on my first DB and found that the company I was designing the DB for started to get slightly irritated. This is because in this book Michael suggests you have a full blown manager and or user meeting with virtually every single change you make (also meetings for requirements, ideas, characteristic identification, user input meetings, manager meetings... oh look, a change happened, now we have to go through all of the same meetings again... and again... and... >yawn<... every other page in this book suggests another meeting). I must have had 25-30 meetings total, which just isn't necessary. Also, there is all sorts of spec sheets you should fill out for every single aspect of the database. I would probably just use a modeling tool (such as Visio) instead of going through this daunting task (I would have had to fill out over 300 spec sheets just for the fields!... it was a big DB)

Although his way of designing is probably the way you should really go, I found that designing a sound database doesn't require quite so much work. You can do most of the design process if you have a good modeling tool, which is what I ended up doing and my DB turned out quite well (you still should conduct meetings, but not for every single aspect of the database... your clients will begin to think you have no idea what you're doing). However, this book pounds the relational design in your head so much, that you can't help but get over the tough learning curve of how a relational database really should be designed.",10

I digested it in one day, and it confirmed much of what I knew while it more formalized it, and also introduced and explains some very useful concepts. An absolute must to creating databases.

My only small critique is the advice on naming tables and fields is slightly dated. Steve Wood, in his Alpha 5 Developers forum, posted a great guide to database conventions. He suggests to abandon naming tables in the plural; really a table defines a thing, just many of them, so Person not Persons. Hernandez says this tells you that it is a multirecord table, but they almost all are such; instead, name the rare single record table as such: ""System Parameter Record"".

More significant is naming of fields. Since we now access fields by the table.field nomenclature, it is redundant to prefix field names with the table name, use ""Name"" instead of ""Customer Name"".

Otherwise, terrific guidelines.",1

Christopher Wanko,2.0 out of 5 stars,Database Design for Mere Mortals: A Hands-On Guide to Relational Database Design (3rd Edition),This book will screw you up if you wanna go pro.,"***NOTE: This review is for the 1997 edition. There has been an update made for 2003 which may or may not address the specific concerns herein.
We'll start with the technical contents. While some reviewers may say this is a book for beginners, I say it's a book for stupid beginners. Let's look at chapter one.
He makes some dubious assertions, such as page 15's highlight that thorough knowledge of SQL isn't necessary. I need to state credentials here: I lead a technical team doing Oracle database development, and I've written code for IBM's DB2, Sybase's Enterprise Adaptive Server, Microsoft's SQL-Server, and now Oracle 8i, 9i, and 9iAS. I'm telling everyone now: you can't be a professional database devloper or designer without thorough SQL knowledge. If you don't know how to use it, or how people need to use your designs through SQL, then you're a liability to the team... not that you'd pass the technical interview after this book anyway.
And page 17 has a little gem about why relational databases were slow because the underlying architecture (CPU, DASD, etc.) wasn't fast enough. Well, yeah, that and the fact that writing a relational database engine is hard, and requires serious horsepower. It *is* the relational database's fault that it was initially slow, because it's not a trivial system.
Dear readers, this is just Chaper One, his overview of databases, and my commetary hadn't even developed full steam yet.
I have index cards for the first six chapters, all with some serious conflicts about his assertions, facts, and teaching methods. I haven't done this kind of in-depth refutation (for free) since college, but the content troubled me enough to capture it. It comes to this single point: this book will screw up beginners.
The terminology is wrong in some key spots. The author doesn't distinguish poor design at first, and takes some liberties in naming things: multivalued fields are really variable arrays, he refuses to use industry terms like 'constraint', 'row', or 'column'. By chapter three, I'd better not be seeing the components of a table referred to as 'fields' and 'records' but sure enough, he's plugging along. He mixes in database design goals with business requirements gathering, meeting facilitation, and other stray bits of knowledge he happens to have laying around. The book will not teach you database design correctly.
I think part of it is the goals of the book do not match the title. This is trying to be a primer for beginniner database developers; at that task he's more successful, but claims of being ""database-independent"" fall woefully short: there's no mention of ANSI-SQL in any detail, which is the lingua franca of database developers and the only database-independent method of conveying universal principles. Nope, he sticks to a decidely Access-oriented terminology (records and fields! Fie on it!).
I'll stick with the two-star rating, because his latest version may yet hold promise for beginners, and because if you happen to be using Microsoft Access, this book will actually help you. If you want to write database code for me, though, I'd suggest working your way through Joe Celko's books instead.",70

Anonymous Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals and Noise (Dover Books on Mathematics)",An Unimposing Introduction,"I got this on a whim (Dover books are cheap) as I was starting an Information Theory Course. This does not provide a substitute on that kind of text, but it does provide more explained approach for the less technically inclined. Whereas most information theory books are so equation heavy they appear to be written in Romulan, this explains what things mean, rather than directly proving how to get there, which helps tie things together. That said, it's like a straight narrative versus an instruction manual, and makes an excellent supplement (or good general purpose reading, if that's your inclination).

Decent algebra knowledge is required as background, and that's about it.",10
A. Adamson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals and Noise (Dover Books on Mathematics)",Brilliant and thought provoking,"I wish every topic had a book like this one to introduce newcomers.

Information theory is itself fairly interesting, but I found that the author used intriguing examples from a broad variety of disciplines to capture the reader's attention. He also has something of a self-deprecating writing style that will bring a smile to your face once or twice in each chapter.

I loved the discussion of language and letter frequency, and it was even more interesting since now easily accessible tools exist (like Google's ngram) which allow you to explore some of the data and concepts first hand. I've explored various error correction/detection schemes online to gain a cursory understanding - this book did far more for me thanks to the simple and straightforward examples. I feel confident I could write my own (albeit basic) error correction code now, thanks solely to this book. I admit that the n-dimensional hypersphere-based code correction is somewhat beyond an easy implementation for me, but still, the explanation is engaging and I feel confident that I can explain the basics of geometrical error correction codes on a high level, which will be useful to me in my course of work.

Anyhow, this kind of book, with enough depth to be challenging for someone with a basic science background yet still casual enough to read a bit here and there without getting lost, is a rare find. Well worth the very reasonable price. I wager that even someone with little interest in science or math could find some very interesting gems here. Have a deamy day.",5
John Kenderdine,4.0 out of 5 stars,"An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals and Noise (Dover Books on Mathematics)",Advanced introduction for STEM and language (communications),"I have been working my way slowly through this book, as it reads like a typical non-fiction STEM text. Therefore, I have not completed it, yet. Even with a physics teaching background and two degrees in physics, I have to go slowly to fully grasp some of the esoterica, although it is enlightening and brings deeper understanding to many ideas in computer and internet communications to say nothing of ""old fashioned"" telegraphy and telephony. It is geared toward a more popular audience, but if math and physics is not of great interest to you, it may not be your cup of tea.

Beyond the core sciences students of languages might be guided toward new perspectives on languages in general whether spoken, written, symbolic, encrypted (codex), DNA, etc.",2
Brett A. Fishwild,4.0 out of 5 stars,"An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals and Noise (Dover Books on Mathematics)",Great for an information theory laymen,"I am not schooled in this field of science, so I cannot verify the accuracy of the terminology and methods or account for how current the material is - but I did find this book very engaging. There is some light math throughout, mostly discussing probabilities, but not enough to ward off a reader not well versed in science or math. The examples of the theories can at times seem a little obtuse at first, I had to reread some sections, but in the end I found that I had a decent understanding of the overall intent of the field. The main narrative of this book is how binary signals have been used from telegraphy up through voice and then television signals, and how their coding has evolved. That and the concept of entropy - of choice or determining what you don't know with each transmission of information. I think more dedicated scholars of this field might find this a ""survey"" type book - especially those last 3 or 4 chapters - but for us laymen I would recommend it.",3

Heavy on the maths - I skipped most of the equations, but I did at least try to understand them. (I'm reading for leisure, not study, so it's not highly important). He introduces you to those that studied and theorized in all walks of the field. He encourages extended learning and explains the levels of involvement in related work. The chapters are short enough but also involved, for those who have already been a part of electronics in some way or the other. If you know zilch about electricity, don't bother with this read. You will get frustrated quick.",1
Karen Chung,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals and Noise (Dover Books on Mathematics)",A gentle yet solid introduction to information theory,"The potential applications of information theory are endless, since just about everything in this world reaches us at varying levels of density, and varying levels of entropy, i.e. some events are highly predictable, others not. In language, for example, you have dense content words like ""bird"" and ""wash"" and low information-density function words like ""the"" and ""in"". Sometimes you can easily guess the next word in an utterance, sometimes you're totally surprised by it. The problem is that many liberal arts types who could use the ideas of information theory in their work may be scared off by the math.

This book overcomes this problem by keeping the math very simple and completely transparent. The only real mathematical operation involved beyond simple arithmetic is logarithms, which are truly not difficult. Every formula is explained in prose, with all the terms explicitly identified. Pierce even tells you how to read each equation aloud, something that not everybody automatically knows how to do, e.g. when it comes to summation signs and such.

Pierce also launches a few fanciful forays into information theory and music, art, and psychology, which I found engaging and thought-provoking.

Other books of this type tend to be much heavier on the math and lighter on the explicit explanations and definition of terms. This book is highly recommended for anyone - of any comfort level with math - who is interested in the basics of information theory and its possible applications in your own areas of interest.",5
William Schram,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals and Noise (Dover Books on Mathematics)",Fascinating,"Just as the title says, this is an introduction to Information Theory, which is the mathematical theory pertaining to information; quantifying it, and testing the limits of how it spreads.

This book contains the math necessary to calculate how much information is in a language, say, or in a coded message. As such, it is an excellent introduction.",1

Martin Hilbert,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals and Noise (Dover Books on Mathematics)",Still unrivaled as an entry point,"Pierce gives a great first overview of the subject. Even after studying Information Theory more profoundly, this book and the wording Pierce chooses is still a frequent reference for me. He communicates complex ideas very clearly and eloquently. The second part of the book could be updated, since there are many new fields in which Information Theory has been applied since 1980 (and the mentioned ones have evolved), but we all to often reinvent history anyways, so it doesn't hurt to get an idea about the diverse fields Shannon's ideas have already been applied even back in the 1970s...

For a very well written and much more mathematical treatment, I would suggest picking up Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms by MacKay, which also covers many interesting and related topics. With this being said, I still loved this book. The author does a good job of presenting the material, some of which follows Shannon's original paper and some if which is original work, in a very clear and interesting way. Even though this book is rather old it is still relevant to the field it covers. Best of all, it would be interesting to someone of any mathematical maturity from those who have not done any since high school to those who use it everyday in their work.

This is the ONLY book of which I am aware which attempts to present Shannon's results to the educated lay reader, and Pierce does a crackerjack job of it. Notwithstanding, this is not a book for the casual reader.

This book allows you to look at the applications for information theory in Physics, Biology, and Psychology in ways that are still germane to presentations in Scientific American magazine. The book also covers information with respect to Cybernetics which I believe morphed into systems theory. I believe the book covers Benoit Mandelbrot and power laws before they became Chaos Theory.

Dover has several other books on Information Theory. I plan on reading Information Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics) (which looks to be slightly over my head) and then re-reading this book.

An additional factor driving my interest in this book is the fact that James Gleik wrote The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood. In the eighties I read Chaos: Making a New Science and then spent three years trying to understand Fractals and Chaos Theory. This time I am trying to approach the subject from fundamentals.

This book tells the story of the consolidation of new inventions that impact our world in the hands of a few people who have their finger on a master switch of sorts.
Master Switch argues that the internet age is not so different from the age of the telegraph (they were working on a way to get ""texting"" machines into every home before radio hit!) or radio, or Hollywood, or Television, or cable TV.
The story is the same. A new disruptive technology comes along, and people with big lawyers and big world changing monopolist visions usurp it from small operators and inventors. Patent stealing, inventor scamming, government policy manipulation, and big law are used as levers to hoist new technology onto monopolist mounds of media conglomeration.
As a result we get stifling, repression of cool new inventions. Television, invented in 1929, doesn't see the light of day until 1939 and is totally usurped by the radio kingpins by 1949. AT&T invents the magnetic drive, answering machine, optical cable (breakthroughs we associate with the past 30 years) in 1930! But because these would cannibalize their core business, we had to wait until the breakup of MaBell in the 70's and 80's to see hard drives, high-speed internet, and answering machines...50 years after they were invented. It all just sat in Bell Labs R&D. They were a monopoly. And that is the story of the book. It squeezed-to-death what vestiges of naivete I had for the internet age freedoms we apparently enjoy today. I now understand Net neutrality. and the ""cycle"" of consolidation that is in play right now.
I now understand AT&T's evil plans against Google. And Googles evil plans against AT&T.
One owns the wires and can flip the master switch in collusion with the govn't. One owns the mind share of the citizenry and can manipulate perception with it's master switch much the way TV has influence culture before cable. AT&T owns the wires of the internet, Google owns our intentions via search. Will they decentralize? Will they become bigger monopolies?
Great book to read to get your head around whether or not the internet will go the way of all information industries before it.",7
Vlad Buckets,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires,A gripping history builds to a compelling warning,"I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has an interest in history, technology, or net neutrality. Since I fall into all three categories, for me, this book read like a gripping, page-turning novel. This 100+ year journey through multiple information industries was quite educational and entertaining, though a clear bias against corporate self-regulation or government sponsored monopolies can be found on nearly every page. Still, I felt the author's position was compellingly built. To take on over a century of history in less than 400 pages is very ambitious, but I was impressed by the level of detail the book went into for the various subjects covered. I do not claim to be an expert on the material, so I cannot comment on the level of misinformation, but the plentiful sources and footnotes adds to the book's credibility. I did find myself on rare occasion saying, ""Hmm... I don't think that's quite right.""

The only thing I was disappointed by was the relatively brief exploration of modern issues, including net neutrality. I cannot call this a criticism as the book is not marketed as a primer for net neutrality, but I was hoping for a little more content relating to the recent history of the Internet and the important issues to be solved for the future. Even though I tend to side with the author's position, I would agree that a more equal treatment of the other sides of this debate would have strengthened the argument. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent reading through ""The Master Switch"" and would enthusiastically encourage everyone to give it a look.",1

O. Halabieh,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires,A Recount of the Information Industry!,"The main premise of the book, as stated by the author: ""To understand the forces threatening the Internet as we know it, we must understand how information technologies give rise to industries, and industries to empires. In other words, we must understand the nature of the Cycle, its dynamics, what makes it go, and what can arrest it. As with any economic theory, there are no laboratories but past experience...The pattern is distinctive. Every few decades, a new communications technology appears, bright with promise and possibility. It inspires a generation to dream of a better society, new forms of expression, alternative types of journalism. Yet each new technology eventually reveals its flaws, kinks, and limitations. For consumers, the technical novelty can wear thin, giving way to various kinds of dissatisfaction with the quality of content (which may tend toward the chaotic and the vulgar) and the reliability or security of service. From industry's perspective, the invention may inspire other dissatisfactions: a threat to the revenues of existing information channels that the new technology makes less essential, if not obsolete; a difficulty commoditizing (i.e., making a salable product out of) the technology's potential; or too much variation in standards or protocols of use to allow one to market a high quality product that will answer the consumers' dissatisfactions. ""

Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:

1- ""In fact, the place we find ourselves now is a place we have been before, albeit in different guise. And so understanding how the fate of the technologies of the twentieth century developed is important in making the twenty-first century better.""

2- ""Schumpeter's cycle of industrial life and death is an inspiration for this book. His thesis is that in the natural course of things, the new only rarely supplements the old; it usually destroys it. The old, however, doesn't, as it were, simply give up but rather tries to forestall death or co-opt its usurper--a la Kronos--with important implications.""

3- ""We have seen how important outsiders are to industrial innovation: they alone have the will or interest to challenge the dominant industry. And we have seen the power of considerations beyond wealth or security--factors outside the motivations of the ideal rational economic actor--in inspiring action to transform an industry.""

4- ""Here, then, we come to the second weakness that afflicts centralized systems of innovation: the necessity, by definition, of placing all control in a few hands. This is not to say that doing so holds no benefit. To be sure, there is less ""waste"": instead of ten companies competing to develop a better telephone--reinventing the wheel, as it were, every time--society's resources can be synchronized in their pursuit of the common goal. There is no duplication of research, with many laboratories chasing the same invention. Yet if all resources for solving any problem are directed by a single, centralized intelligence. that mastermind has to be right in predicting the future if innovation is to proceed effectively. And that's the problem: monopoly presumes a prescience that humans are seldom capable of. ""

5- ""For the combined forces of a dominant industry and the federal government can arrest the Cycle's otherwise inexorable progress, intimating for the prevailing order something like Kronos's fantasy of perpetual rule.""

6- ""Whether sanctioned by the state or not, monopolies represent a special kind of industrial concentration, with special consequences flowing from their dissolution. Often the useful results are delayed and unpredictable, while the negative outcomes are immediate and obvious.""

7- ""But what prevented monopoly and all centralized systems from realizing these efficiencies, in Hayek's view, was a fundamental failure to appreciate human limitations. With perfect information, a central planner could effect the best of all possible arrangements, but no such planner could ever hope to have all the relevant facts of local, regional, and national conditions to arrive at an adequately informed, or right, decision.""

8- ""As an object lesson in the way information networks can develop, it gives us occasion to consider what we truly want from our news and entertainment, as opposed to what sort of content we might be prepared to sustain, however passively, with our fleeting attention. For cable offered choices really only in the commercial range--(-enough, however, to suggest what a truly open medium could deliver to the nation, for better and for worse.""

9- ""With its hefty capitalization, it offers the information industries financial stability, and potentially a great freedom to explore risky projects. Yet despite that promise, the conglomerate can as easily become a hidebound, stifling master, obsessed with maximizing the revenue potential and flow of its intellectual property. At its worst, such an organization can carry the logic of mass cultural production to any extreme of banality as long as it seems financially feasible.""

10- ""For the information industries that now account for an ever increasing share of American and world GDP, the coming decade will be given over to a mighty effort to seize territory, to bolt the competition from its habitat. But this is not a case of one pack of wolves chasing another out of a prime valley. While it may sound fanciful, the contest in question is more like one of polar bears batting lions for domination of the world. Each animal, insuperably dominant in its natural element--the polar bear on ice and snow, the lion on the open plains--will undertake a land grab where it has no natural business being. The only practicable strategy will be a campaign of climate change, the polar bears seeking to cover as much of the world with snow as they can, while the lion tries to coax a savannah from the edges of a tundra. Sounds absurd, but for these mighty predators, it's simply the law of nature.""

11- ""The democratization of technological power has made the shape of the future hard to know, even for the best informed. The individual holds more power than at any time in the past century, and literally in the palm of his hand. Whether or not he can hold on to it is another matter.""

12- ""The American political system is designed to prevent abuses of pubic power. But where it has proved less vigilant is in those areas where the political meets the economic realm, where private economic power comes to bear on public life...We like to believe that our safeguards against concentrated political power will ultimately protect us from the consequences of accumulated economic power. But this hasn't always been so.""

13- ""For history shows that in seeking to prevent the exercise of abusive power in the information industries, government is among those actors whose power must be restrained. Government may function as a check on abusive power, but government itself is a power that must be checked. What I propose is not a regulatory approach but rather a constitutional approach to the information economy. By that I mean a regime whose goal is to constrain and divide all power that derives from the control of information.""

14- ""Let us. then, not fail to protect ourselves from the will of those who might seek domination of those resources we cannot do without. If we do not take this moment to secure our sovereignty over the choices that our information age has allowed us to enjoy, we cannot reasonably blame its loss on those who are free to enrich themselves by taking it from us in a manner history has foretold.""",1

Pseudonym,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires,"Great historical treatment, but falls short predicting the future","The Master Switch a powerful book that will influence policy debates for some time to come. My review follows. The book has two parts. The former discusses the history of communications media through the twentieth century and shows evidence for ""The Cycle"" of open innovation -> closed monopoly -> disruption. The latter, shorter part is more speculative and argues that the same fate will befall the Internet, absent aggressive intervention.

The first part of the book is unequivocally excellent. There are so many grand as well as little historical facts buried in there. Wu makes his case well for the claim that radio, telephony, film and television have all taken much the same path.

A point that Wu drives home repeatedly is that while free speech in law is always spoken of in the context of Governmental controls, the private entities that own or control the medium of speech play a far bigger role in practice in determining how much freedom of speech society has. In the U.S., we are used to regulating Governmental barriers to speech but not private ones, and a lot of the book is about exposing the problems with this approach.

An interesting angle the author takes is to look at the motives of the key men that shaped the ""information industries"" of the past. This is apposite given the enormous impact on history that each of these few has had, and I felt it added a layer of understanding compared to a purely factual account.

But let's cut to the chase--the argument about the future of the Internet. I wasn't sure whether I agreed or disagreed until I realized Wu is making two different claims, a weak one and a strong one, and does not separate them clearly.

The weak claim is simply that an open Internet is better for society in the long run than a closed one. Open and closed here are best understood via the exemplars of Google and Apple. Wu argues this reasonably well, and in any case not much argument is needed--most of us would consider it obvious on the face of it.

The strong claim, and the one that is used to justify intervention, is that a closed Internet will have such crippling effects on innovation and such chilling effects on free speech that it is our collective duty to learn from history and do something before the dystopian future materializes. This is where I think Wu's argument falls short.

To begin with, Wu doesn't have a clear reason why the Internet will follow the previous technologies, except, almost literally, ""we can't be sure it won't."" He overstates the similarities and downplays the differences.

Second, I believe Wu doesn't fully understand technology and the Internet in some key ways. Bizarrely, he appears to believe that the Internet's predilection for decentralization is due to our cultural values rather than technological and business realities prevalent when these systems were designed.

Finally, Wu has a tendency to see things in black and white, in terms of good and evil, which I find annoying, and more importantly, oversimplified. He quotes this sentence approvingly: ""Once we replace the personal computer with a closed-platform device such as the iPad, we replace freedom, choice and the free market with oppression, censorship and monopoly."" He also says that ""no one denies that the future will be decided by one of two visions,"" in the context of iOS and Android. It isn't clear why he thinks they can't coexist the way the Mac and PC have.

Regardless of whether one buys his dystopian prognostications, Wu's paradigm of the ""separations principle"" is to be taken seriously. It is far broader than even net neutrality. There appear to be two key pillars: a separation of platforms and content, and limits on corporate structures to faciliate this--mainly vertical, but also horizontal, such as in the case of media conglomerates.

Interestingly, Wu wants the separations principle to be more of a societal-corporate norm than Governmental regulation. That said, he does call for more powers to the FCC, which is odd given that he is clear on the role that State actors have played in the past in enabling and condoning monopoly abuse (I quote):

""Again and again in the histories I have recounted, the state has shown itself an inferior arbiter of what is good for the information industries. The federal government's role in radio and television from the 1920s to the 1960s, for instance, was nothing short of a disgrace. In the service of chain broadcasting, it wrecked a vibrant, decentralized AM marketplace. At the behest of the ascendant radio industry, it blocked the arrival and prospects of FM radio, and then it put the brakes on television, reserving it for the NBC-CBS duopoly. Finally, from the 1950s through the 1960s, it did everything in its power to prevent cable television from challenging the primacy of the networks.""

To his credit, Wu does seem to be aware of the contradiction, and appears to argue that the Government agencies can learn and change. It does seem like a stretch, however.

In summary, Wu deserves major kudos both for the historical treatment and for some very astute insights about the Internet. For example, in the last 2-3 years, Apple, Facebook, and Twitter have all made dramatic moves toward centralization, control and closed platforms. Wu seems to have foreseen this general trend more clearly than most techies did.[1] The book does have drawbacks, and I don't agree that the Internet will go the way of past monopolies without intervention. It should be very interesting to see what moves Wu will make now that he will be advising the FTC.

[1] While the book was published in late 2010, I assume that Wu's ideas are much older.",1

Erickson,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires,Fascinating and Unique Perspective on Telecom and Media History,"Disclaimer: I am a telecommunications and Internet lawyer that works in many of the areas about which Professor Wu writes, so I may have more than a casual interest in the subject matter. Having said that, the first half of the book really goes beyond media and information policy but rather provides a thrilling and entertaining account of the larger-than-life personalities who helped shaped America's information infrastructure. This was a time when many CEOs, even when pursuing corporate profit, also seemed to have a sense of contributing to society's goals. Yes, often, they confused what was good for their own company with what was good for the country. The book also provides compelling stories relating to the cycle of innovation in various media and telecommunications fields -- stories that repeat themselves over and again. These stories leave us to question how the existing innovation explosion involving the way movies and television are distributed, instant messaging and text messaging, tweets, social media, search, mobile Internet access, music -- how the innovation surrounding these media will develop. The book might leave one with the urge to want to ensure our policies incubate and protect such innovation before owners of the Master Switch seek to dominate and control those spaces. In the end, though, I found the book leaving me optimistic over our country's history of innovation -- a history that survives sometimes against staggering odds and often born in the most humble circumstances, even for example a friend's garage. - Markham Erickson",1
David Weinberger,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires,"Fascinating history, provocative thesis","Those who read Tim Wu's previous book, Who Controls the Internet?: Illusions of a Borderless World (with Jack Goldsmith), will not be surprised by the clarity and command of facts Wu exhibits in The Master Switch. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that he is also an able historian and story-teller. The Master Switch is a compelling read, fascinating in both its detail and its overall case. For this is not a mere history. Wu finds a pattern in how information industries have developed since the end of the 19th century in America, starting out as open to every amateur and quickly becoming consolidated into efficient monopolies. It is not a happy pattern for those of us who (like Woo himself) cherish the Internet as an open, raucous medium. This is especially the case since, as Wu argues, the earlier information monopolists often felt a sense of obligation to the public that the new ones do not.

Some of the histories Wu recounts will be more familiar, but some shed light on industry histories not often part of the telecommunications debate. For example, Wu's narrative of the rise and consolidation of the motion picture industry was fresh and fascinating. In every case, the stories are well-told, fun to read, and illuminating.",1

Non sequitur,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires,A compelling essay on the dangers of centralization in the information age,"This book is a thoroughly compelling, thought provoking read.

A good part of the book goes through how information industries such as telephony, radio, film, and TV, have historically undergone cycles of moving from open, decentralized systems to closed, centralized leviathans. Then, in the final few chapters, the author asks the question of whether our present day highly digitized information economy might be prone to the same creeping consolidation and commercialization, at the expense of innovation and diversity.

To give you a flavor of what the thesis of the book is:

1. Free speech isn't just about a conceptual and abstract right to be heard; the way the medium disseminating information is set up is just as important in deciding who gets heard. If the ""Master Switch"" is biased towards a certain type of content (say, for reasons of commercial interest), or centralized to a point of being easily controlled and manipulated by either public or private forces, then the foundation of free speech is resting on very shaky ground indeed.

2. Industries go through cycles of starting with creative destruction from disruptive technologies, followed by consolidation and emergence of winners, ending with the next round of new innovations restarting the cycle anew. In the context of information economies, the cost of the consolidation phase historically has been a suppression of innovation, and a loss of cultural diversity that often has happened undetected by the contemporaries.

3. The author, passionate about protecting the richness of cultural and intellectual life, advocates a separation principle where ownership ties between content and communication infrastructure is severed, to ensure net neutrality (i.e. whoever operates the ""Master Switch"" must operate in a non-discriminatory fashion, untainted by ulterial commercial motives, in the same way a utility offering critical services is required to do.

Assuming I've summarized the central argument of the book well, you may wonder how it takes 300+ pages to say all that. I assure you Tim Wu brings this whole discussion to life, with a very well written narrative of how the evolution of telephony, radio, film and TV has followed the cyclical model the author had laid out.

Throughout the book, I just couldn't help being hit with this sense of wonder again and again, that the parallels between our age and what people have lived through for the past 100 years are simply amazing. We tend to think of ourselves being at the pinnacle of an information revolution, where technology is enabling us to tap previously unavailable pockets of knowledge, and to connect with strangers that we have no other means of reaching ... Now think of the excitement, the sense of human achievement, and the same idealism coursing through the veins of those who use the telephone or listen to the radio for the first time; the human race has definitely been here before. Citing one of my favorite quotes from the book which summarizes the (fallible) sentiment of every era: ""Every age thinks it's the modern age, but this one really is.""

The next to last chapter includes a narrative of a Battle Royale between Apple and Google. I won't spoil it any further for you; suffice it to say it's a very interesting take on the two companies.

All in all, a highly recommended read.",2
Mark D. Schaeffer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires,"It's about time somebody wrote a book like this, well done, excellent","I'm pretty critical on reviewing books and this is a rare five star. Most of us are wondering how the Internet will evolve and how it will change the future of our society in terms of where the power of information and entertainment will reside, and Wu does a great job at giving us a brief ""history lesson"" of several key industries - telegraph, telephone, AM and FM radio, broadcast TV, cable TV, Hollywood, and the Internet. For each, he takes us through examples of how each is subject to the same ""Cycle"" of disruptive innovation by entrepreneurs who first bring the promise of diversity and decentralization of power, but this is ultimately followed by the centralization of power as corporate interests consolidate power, and diversity reduces and control by few individuals affects our everyday lives and culture. It's well balanced as Wu always compares the advantages of centralized power (e.g.efficiency, quality, time to market) with it's disadvantages (e.g. stifling innovation, controlling our culture). He illustrates the role of the government at usually siding with the interests of corporate consolidation, but sometimes playing an important role at doing the opposite (e.g. breaking up the old Hollywood's control of theaters, breaking up AT&T, bring Cable TV along). He also illustrates the importance of certain powerful individuals at consolidating power, as well as other individuals at breaking up consolidated power, both sides believing in their causes more so than being in it for the money. The stories he uses to illustrate his points contain details I haven't heard of before, it's an enjoyable read, and well analyzed. I cannot attest to the accuracy of his information and analysis, but it's very credible and well balanced.

It's clear that Wu believes in limiting power, but who wouldn't unless you were a rising captain of industry. As I read it, I couldn't help but wonder if the Internet is different, and eagerly waited for the big Aha, the big revelation at the end. And that is where I had more mixed feelings. In the conclusion, firstly Wu did a great job at cutting through the noise and pointing out that there is always a battle between centralized power and decentralized power and this battle is not just about the obvious economic factors, but individuals who believe in the merits of their respective position on this issue. He pointed out that on one side we have centralized power via AT&T, Apple, Disney, NBC for example, and on the other side we have decentralized power via Google, Amazon, Wikipedia. His argument is that the centralized powers want to control Internet access and it was clear that his centralized issue was ensuring Net Neutrality which he described as the ""common carrier issue of the Internet"". At first I was disappointed that this was his main point as I don't believe that we should seriously be worried about Net Neutrality. As one of millions of people who are trying to heard on the Internet, I was hoping I was going to get more insights into the marketing power of large companies on the Internet - i.e. how do you get through the noise. Even though we small players can distribute our content on the Internet, it's still the larger players who can afford to give away a lot for free, create well produced content, and use a combination of Internet advertising/presence and traditional media channels to brand themselves. So I believe you can make an argument that in the long run, the Internet will actually make things worse for the small players because it allows an even smaller number of large players to dominate by reaping large profits with small profit margins across an enormous volume of customers. You of course could make the opposite argument that the Internet promotes diversity as the key to success is dominating a micromarket, something the larger players are not well equipped to do. So there was very little insight into that, and this was my key disappointment.

However, it was a good reminder that we can't take Net Neutrality for granted. Wu made many strong points for Net Neutrality (i.e. separation of distribution and content) at a legal level. These arguments were good and well summarized, but nothing new. However, once I saw the main point of the book being don't take this for granted, I saw important insights that he made on this topic. He pointed out that the ability for large players (both corporations and individuals) to consolidate power and control us is greater than ever with the Internet. He was focused mostly on Net Neutrality and indicated that the combination Apple and Google could fall prey ultimately to the power of the networks (e.g. AT&T). He illustrated that there are a variety of government actions that can be done across several parts of the government to ensure Net Neutrality: e.g. FCC, anti-trust/legal, etc. (i.e. you can't rely on any one government entity). But he pointed out that ultimately, what really determines what a big player will do on this issue (or any issue) is regulating their own behavior to ensure they don't alienate their customers and get bad press - imagine the backlash if a Comcast was caught censoring a website. This might fly in China, but not in the US. So in a very Jeffersonian sense, the awareness of the population of these issues, and their intolerance of it is the best defense. So, ultimately, we have to protect our right to ditch Comcast (for example) for some other Internet carrier, and fortunately we have many options - the local phone company, wireless, etc. So Wu's argument that this is an important issue is very well taken, but I'm not sure if it's the key concern.

If we look at the Apple/AT&T combination as Wu highlights, is the concern one of Net Neutrality? The concern is more about Apple's ability to censor what applications run on their iPhone/iPad. But even they got a lot of bad press about preventing certain Google and Skype apps from running on their phone. So I don't buy Wu's arguments about the real concern being these issues. He missed to me a critical issue of of marketing, branding, copyright protection, and getting your share of the noise. And he did correctly point out that anyone interesting in copyright protection is going to prefer an Apple approach vs. a Google approach as you can get some protection, certainly from the point of view of Software/applications, but no longer for music/videos, etc.

It's anybody's guess as to where this is going. But Wu does a great job at putting history into perspective, illustrating that we shouldn't take Net Neutrality for granted, and seeing that the cycle of those pushing for consolidation/centralization will always be at odds with those pushing for decentralization - i.e. a great framework for pondering and discussion. I believe that some level of consolidation is needed even if you're one to push for advocacy of issues like saving the environment, allowing smaller producers of entertainment to be heard, grass roots politics, etc, because without some level of consolidation, there will just be noise out there. And that's the biggest enemy, because only the big players might be able to cut through the noise, and over history, creating noise is an important tactic that those seeking power use.",2

The handful of corporations that control the television and radio stations that broadcast over the airwaves have lost their domination to the internet.

READ THIS BOOK, then log onto [...] to see how concentrated media control over what we view and listen to really is, with the exception of the internet.",1
Robert J. Hard,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires,A Switch in Time,"A Switch In Time

Tim Wu's The Master Switch is destined to be one of the more important books of recent years for one over-riding reason: It explains why our information superstructure is in the midst of a titanic war for control. This war will determine in the most radical terms whether we can continue to hope to be a free society--where pretty well anyone can find out pretty well anything--or slide backward into a passive information lumpen proletariat where organizations with their own best interests at heart will dictate what we can and can not learn.

Wu's central theme is The Cycle, the idea that new forms of information transmission start as free and open to all, but are invariably captured by would-be monopolists who seek to control not just the medium (the physical pipes, wires and airwaves) but the content that flows through it. Even when the monopolist appears to be a simple
""common carrier,"" transmitting all messages with commendable neutrality, that is not how history has played out.

Thus, it came as a revelation (at least to me) that Western Union, the erstwhile electrical communications monopolist of the 19th century, routinely monitored the traffic to obtain the dirt on inconvenient politicians, and then fed the same to its companion newspaper monopolist, the Associated Press, to put the compliant non-entity Rutherford B. Hayes in the White House in 1876.

(Much of WesternUnion's infrastructure, it turns out, was built at public expense by the Union Army during the Civil War. Western Union's absorption of this provenance is a stellar example of the conversion of public monies to private use, an egregious breech of public trust with which our history is so sadly littered. Hence the imperative of eliminating politicians who ask too many embarrassing questions, and their replacement with either fools or servants of the commercial interests that reap where they have not sown.)

Lest we comfort ourselves with the notion that this was a quaint footnote to history, Wu points out how the reconstituted AT&T, which many of us think of little more than a nostalgic trade mark, installed a series of ""secret rooms"" at its switching centers--at the behest of the Bush Administration--to eavesdrop on substantially all of the nation's internet traffic in 2002. No warrants, no safeguards, no controls--and for ought we know, they remain a new and robust weapon in the hands of any president (or his minions) who cares to use the fruits thus harvested.

And this was another revelation: How At&T, which I had assumed had been drawn and quartered (actually cut into eighths), has put itself essentially back together with a vengeance. Growing out of marriages between Bell operating companies that had once been sundered (and supervised by the federal courts pursuant to a consent decree), the new AT&T competes now only with Verizon (and that none too strenuously), which itself is a marriage of the other former Bell operating companies.

In short, in telephony, we're pretty well back to where we were prior to the twin remedies of break-up and deregulation, but with this difference: The old AT&T was regulated. The new one is not. The old AT&T also had a parallel mission with its monopolistic drive: Universal service in every sense of that term. The new one seeks only money and control, and the public interest is simply irrelevant. Recall that competition was supposed to keep everyone honest. You haven't heard much from MCI lately, have you? The way AT&T has used state and federal law to thwart competition would do Machiavelli proud.

But back to The Cycle: Wu looks at three exemplars: Telephony, Hollywood movie studios and David Sarnoff's RCA/NBC combo to show how media that were once open are systematically closed, and remain closed (typically with government help) more or less indefinitely. While classical economics (the Adam Smith variety) argues that competition will keep overcharging/under-serving businesses from lasting very long, Wu looks to economist Joseph Schumpeter to explain how it is that monopolization is essentially the natural state of capitalism, and that monopolies last not until they are changed by government action (since monopolists tend to corrupt government anyway) but rather until they are overthrown by disruptive technologies.

That threat is one of which the information emperors of yore were only too aware. Consequently, suppression of innovation has been a marquis feature of information monopolies throughout their existence. Thus, it was fascinating to read how the Bell Labs division of AT&T had actually developed voice recording on magnetic media, and the telephone answering machine, in the late 1930s. To Ma Bell's increasingly paranoid higher-ups, this was not a new product that could enhance revenue and service, but A TERRBLE THREAT. What if, the execs wondered, people thought their calls could be recorded? Could it threaten written contracts? Would people stop talking about sex on the phone? Both business and personal traffic could collapse.

The invention was stopped in its tracks, its developers sworn to secrecy. That it existed even in the lab was kept secret until discovered in the archives in the mid-1990s. As a young boy in the 1950s I remember our first tape recorder, a wondrous if somewhat cumbersome reel-to-reel machine. I also recall that the instructions were in German, the native tongue of the manufacturer. Our next tape recorder was Japanese. Ever wonder why our erstwhile opponents totally dominated that market? The answer is because AT&T's reach did not extend that far.

Equally intriguing is Wu's recounting of how RCA developed and then suppressed FM radio for a decade, followed by its even more ignominious power play for control of television. Having ripped off the technology itself from inventor Philo Farnsworth, RCA/ NBC then used its formidable influence over the FCC to make sure that no one else could broadcast until NBC was good and ready--and that the NBC business model of commercial-driven broadcasting would remain unchallenged.

One of the few faults in Wu's line of reasoning--and there are very few indeed--is the focus on NBC as though it were the only broadcaster of note. He mentions CBS in passing, dismissing it (with little explanation) as essentially a step-child of NBC. The origin of ABC is not discussed at all. I think this point deserves some discussion, because the networks clearly compete for audience. One can surmise that the larger point is that since all three networks had essentially identical business models--a mass audience addressed by national advertisers--the product would become virtually indistinguishable. The whole concept of the mass audience virtually compels mediocrity, but this is my surmise, and not something Prof. Wu actually stated. But he should have.

The big disruptive technology for the broadcasters, of course, was the advent of cable. Not surprisingly, the broadcasters turned to their friends in government (again, a lapdog FCC) to make sure that the blessings of liberty (for the viewers) would most assuredly not be secured. With the historian-cum-poet's gift for detecting irony, Wu recounts how it was the devious Richard Nixon who engineered the overthrow of the entrenched broadcasters. Convinced (not without reason) that the established news departments were biased against him personally and conservatives in general, Nixon reveled in the idea that a totally separate channel (so to say) could be opened to the American people.

In an irony piled on an irony, Nixon had appointed 32-year-old visionary Clay Whitehead to the newly created Office of Telecommunications policy, and Whitehead had a much more open-minded FCC to deal with. To Whitehead, cable TV meant the chance for a truly open market for ideas, information and entertainment, a forum of such scope that the systematic narrowing of the American mind would come to an end. He could hardly have foreseen that out of the Pandora's cable box would flow the Fox News Channel, the self-styled ""fair and balanced"" network whose blend of emotional appeal and disinformation has probably done more to divide American society than any institution since slavery. Somewhere, Dick Nixon is smiling.

While cable certainly has its attractions (I virtually never even bother to check what's playing on ABC-CBS-NBC), just as certainly it has lost some of its original vigor. In the early cable days, one might chance on a medical channel where one could see surgery carried on live. Or MTV consisting of video after video with narry a voice or an ad to interrupt the sheer enjoyment. Indeed the absence of commercials was one cable's primary charms--as it should have been, since one had an onerous monthly tariff to pay for the freight.

But somewhere along the line it was realized that the cable folks could not only extract that monthly rent but hammer and yammer the viewers with ad after ad like the worst of the free broadcasters of old. And you may have noticed how that monthly tariff has only gone up over time.

Yet the story hardly ends there, since the great disrupter of both telephone and cable is the internet. That is the field where The Cycle is still mid-stage and where Wu is at his best in his role as The Great Explainer.

As anyone even casually acquainted with the stock market knows, the merger between Time Warner and AOL was one of the greatest snafus in the history of corporate combinations. The richest merger in business history (with the equity of AOL alone then valued at an astronomical $240 billion), the marriage proved so unsuitable that within a couple of years, the combined companies had lost more than 90% of their value. What were they thinking?

While the received wisdom has it that the relationship foundered on the clash of corporate cultures--between old, slow, low-tech Time Warner and whizz-bang techno-maven AOL--Wu tells a different and far more compelling story. The dinosaur stumbling toward its well-deserved grave was not Time Warner but AOL. What AOL CEO Steve Case realized, but Time Warner CEO Jerald Levin did not, was that the advent of broadband internet service providers that could connect users directly to the 'net had unhinged AOL's business model.

What AOL offered subscribers in the 1980s and 1990s was AOL's version of the internet: A dial-up connection to AOL itself (for $25 or $30 per month), with users able to access a few sites of AOL's choosing. This is what appealed so much to Levin: The idea that anyone ""cruising the net"" would be exposed first and foremost to the content that Time Warner controlled through its movie, TV and publishing empire. In short, it was all about control.

As Wu adeptly points out, AOL's problem was the structure of the internet itself. Unlike a centralized switching center, a la AT&T, the 'net consists of innumerable nodes that function as independent switching centers, allowing for the connection of each to all. Consequently, while AOL characterized itself as an on-ramp to the information superhighway, what it really was was a road that dead-ended in AOL's ""walled garden.""

With the advent of ISPs with broadband connectivity, and effective browser technology, AOL became about as exciting as catching your grandma performing in a strip club. To the extent that AOL continues to exist, it is because it now functions as an on-ramp, but it is only one of the many. Without the control over viewers' eyeballs once promised, the logic of the merger is de minimis.

Yet the failure of the Time-Warner AOL merger does not mean that the issue has been resolved in favor of openness. Quite the reverse. A war is very much in progress between those who want to close the web and those who want to keep it open. On one side are the ""closers,"" typified by Apple, Disney (with which it is closely affiliated), and AT&T. On the other side are Google and its numerous allies, businesses (such as Netflix) and prospective businesses which will die or be still-born if the ""closers"" win out.

The key term of art, the battlefield so to say, is the less than self-explanatory term ""net neutrality."" To appreciate its implications, consider Google, the pioneering search engine. With the litigator's gift for the apt analogy, Wu likens Google to the telephone operators of the old Ma Bell. Their job was to connect any caller to their intended recipient in the fastest and most efficient way possible. What they did not do, and would not dare do, was to decide which callers were more worthy or prompt attention, or which recipients shouldn't receive any calls, or stick you up for extra money to complete particular calls.

Yet that is precisely what the ""closers"" want to do. If they are content providers (like the Warners and Disneys of this world), they want you to see their content but no one else's, or by roundabout means, get you to pay for the privilege of viewing a rival's offerings. If they are a common carrier (such as AT&T, Verizon or a cable company) (Time Warner again), there is a huge windfall to reap by discriminating between internet destinations, slowing or blocking access to some or speeding up access to (high-paying) others.

In effect, the whole premise of being a ""common carrier,"" that the carrier takes all comers without discrimination, is undermined by any rules that permit discrimination. Yet the rules on net neutrality that are being debated as this review is being penned provide only partial protection to the 'net-using public and the enterprises that depend on freedom of access. Carriers will be able to block certain sites, most notably competitors (such as Skype). As to the others, the wire line carriers are supposed to be more or less neutral, but the same rules of neutrality will not be enforced with respect to wireless connections, the area most see as communications' future.

In the backwardized thinking so characteristic of the American right wing, the fact that the federal government is trying to assure any neutrality at all is an example of intrusive government control. Yet it is fair to ask who is being controlled, and for the benefit of whom? If the premise is that the strong should always be entitled to grow stronger, and the weak weaker, then yes, anything that inhibits a potential monopolist is exemplary of intrusive government. Yet if the premise is that the function of government is to protect the weak against the depredations of the strong, then limiting the power of the strong secures the liberty of the whole.

But be prepared: Even the weak rules on net neutrality will remain under attack. We will hear how the entrenched powers are doing consumers the world's biggest favor by limiting their access to this site or that, or that equal access is uneconomic, or why it is in the consumer's best interest to pay more and get less. If Wu's concept of The Cycle has any historic validity, or at least predictive value, the odds do not favor the longevity of net neutrality.

One final point: The Master Switch is written in a clear yet highly literate style that holds close to a compelling narrative arc. One may or may not subscribe to all of Wu's suggested reforms, but anyone who picks this book up will put it down better educated than they were when they began, and on an issue of profound social consequence.",4
Don McGowan,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires,The best coverage of a complex industry I have ever seen,"I have worked in entertainment law for years and also teach it at the University of Washington. I have spent literally years trying to find a book that will accurately cover the issues at a high enough level to be informative without being so deep in the weeds that no one can understand them. Quite simply, this is that book.

Wu has done systematic and in-depth analysis of the history and evolution of media industries including TV, radio, and film. He explains why they have developed the way they have: because there is so much money to be made in controlling all levels of creation and distribution, and as a result any company that can control all levels will do whatever it can to keep out competitors. By keeping out competitors, they narrow the number of companies that are able to control access to that media. And by narrowing the number of companies, they make the industry able to be controlled as well as to control. The evidence is compelling and the cycle has repeated itself over and over.

If I had one suggestion to make, it would be with respect to the last chapter, where he posits the dichotomy between the way Apple views the world and the way Google does: traditional media vision vs. openness. I don't think the world of IT has to work this way: there's a middle ground that believe it or not Microsoft took where they effectively created an environment where the platform would be closed but you can do anything you want on top of it. But that's a small quibble and perhaps reflects nothing more than the fact that for this chapter Wu is talking about an environment where the battle hasn't yet been won by the advocates of closed technology and systems.

If you care at all about entertainment industries, and you aren't scared by words with more than 2 syllables when they show up from time to time, this is your book.",3

Chris,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires,More history than relevance,"First ... I failed to understand this book was largely a history (intent to provide context), rather than perspective and analysis on the current state. After the intro, I skimmed and began reading in the ""Father and Son"" chapter (2d last) at ""Just What Is Google?"". The history was OK, but without original insight. That information lines of business undergo cycles of creation and destruction, competition and monopoly is not news.

Wu writes well on describing the historical pageant ... relationships, interplay of players, and he includes fascinating tidbits to spark interest. But regarding the primary thesis of the book - providing perspective on current state and desired state within his thesis around net neutrality - his effectiveness is mixed. Wu seems to lack understanding of the information business in some areas, including a general understanding of how a business functions, how it creates value. He is very much an idealist (need idealists!), an avowed supporter of capitalism, and defender of competition but .... But in his idealism, he appears to favor government intervention - any and all - whenever a company gains ascendency. He attacks companies that have attained what he sees as 'monopolies', ignoring that disruptive innovation has frequently consigned monopolies to the historical trash bin or nearing the edge of failure regardless of their monopoly (IBM at the event horizon, MSFT continuing to destroy value). And he apparently gives no thought of the unintended consequences of destroying an assumed 'monopoly' (or dismantling it poorly).

The book does contain minor errors or misconceptions that are turnoffs, as if Wu is trying to be too clever by half. For example, p. 283 he reverses the trait of the fox vs that of the hedgehog from what is written in the parable. ""A company like Google, in contrast, succeeds by doing one (well chosen) thing, but doing it better than anyone else. It's the trait that makes Google the fox to so many others' hedgehog."" Later he cites the motivation for vertical integration as 'serving as a means of corporate defense, preventing rivals from depriving it of some essential component'. This is a very incomplete analysis of the +/-'s of vertical integration across businesses. The point is somewhat moot as vertical integration fell from favor decades ago as U.S. companies matured and integration brought bureaucracy and sluggishness. During the re-engineering era, leading companies flattened or split into efficient components. Vertical integration is useful at a particular time in a company's life, depending on competitive environment and business model. It is not a forever state. Wu fails to understand this.

The book's central arguments involve Wu's thoughts on net neutrality and separation (generation vs distribution). While applauding motives, I believe he is missing a central tenet, that companies are about making money. Throughout the book it is not apparent that Wu fundamentally understands how companies function and the drive for success. He appears to harbor belief in a type of 'pure' capitalism that maximizes competition without anyone gaining significant competitive advantage. This doesn't detract from the narrative but feels naive. Of course companies wish to control both the generation and distribution of information. They seek to differentiate, create competitive advantage, and construct barriers/moats to competition. Premier franchises have high barriers to entry and high switching costs for subscribers to their products and services. If they can do this by controlling more segments of the business they will do so and it is arguable whether the country is better or worse for this. Dominant IT companies have propelled the U.S. to world leadership.

We now stand at a crossroads between freedom and creativity (Google and Verizon) and monopolistic hegemony (Apple, AT&T and Hollywood). Only net neutrality will save us. If you must read this, buy a used copy. Otherwise, the author would be embarrassed. You see, information wants to be free. That's why property owners, such as AT&T, are craven villains and freeloaders, such as Google, are the heroes. Wu even rags on Locke and Jefferson for their advocacy of property rights for individuals, all the while professing his respect for individual initiative. Why do creative people do what they do? For their fellow man, of course. He even has Google Evangelist Cerf inventing TCP/IP because it embodied net neutrality. Pathetic.

Adam Thierer,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires,"Important, but incomplete, information history","Tim Wu has written an interesting book, but one that fails to heed many of the most important lessons of the history of America's information industries. Prof. Wu claims that information industries are prone to ""cycles"" that generally advance from ""open"" to ""closed"" and he correctly notes that regulatory capture and bureaucratic mismanagement are major culprits. ""Again and again in the histories I have recounted,"" he says, ""the state has shown itself an inferior arbiter of what is good for the information industries. The federal government's role in radio and television from the 1920s through the 1960s, for instance, was nothing short of a disgrace... Government's tendency to protect large market players amounts to an illegitimate complicity ... [particularly its] sense of obligation to protect big industries irrespective of their having become uncompetitive.""

Wu is correct. Strangely, however, he never seems to draw any lesson from that ""disgrace"" and ""complicity."" Indeed, sometimes within a line or two of raising such concerns in his book, Wu seems to dismiss those findings entirely and proposes giving the government far more power to play games within the information sector. If Wu believes what he said about the dangers of regulatory capture and bureaucratic bungling, why is he so eager to empower the State to do even more meddling in information technology sectors?

When it comes to solutions, Wu fails to conduct any serious cost-benefit analysis of the trade-offs associated with an aggrandizement of State power in the name of countering the supposed evils of private power. The solutions Wu offers are typically presented as cost-free options. Yet, Prof. Wu's primary solution, a so-called ""Separation Principle,"" would have a devastating impact on high-technology innovation and competitiveness. Claiming that information industries are too important to be governed by traditional laws and regulations, Wu advocates a sweeping industrial policy that would separate information industries into three buckets -- content, distribution, and devices -- and keep them segregated by force of law. Integration and cross-sector arrangements would essentially become illegal in this system of information apartheid.

Mysteriously, Wu is adamant about this not being a regulatory solution, instead preferring to call it a ""constitutional"" approach. But such semantic sophistry can't disguise the fact that his regime would be an ambitious industrial policy for America's information economy. Entire companies and sectors would need to be undone, and all future technological innovation would need to be subjected to regulatory classification proceedings to determine in which bucket they belong.

Ironically, therefore, Wu's proposed approach would greatly empower the same regulators that he claimed drove previous industries into the ground! They would have even more sway over the future of technological innovation, media policy decisions, and free speech issues. Again, Wu never address the potential downsides or costs of his proposed approach even though we know that, when it comes to regulation, there is no free lunch. Something has to give.

In sum, Wu's hyper-pessimistic worldview and extreme recommendations are unwarranted. The notion that the Internet is dying or that ""openness"" is evaporating is countered by real world experience. Cyberspace has never been more vibrant or open. We don't need to hand regulators ""the master switch"" to the high-tech economy to save us from the phantom menace Wu fears.

Edwin B. Spievack,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires,"""The Master Switch"" is a work of fiction","""The Master Switch"" is good fiction. Technological progress in communications is always accompanied by hype over what it means for wider public access to information and enhanced cultural, social, and political discourse. The hype is always there, and the author of this book buys into it. However, communication technologies, at best, provide alternative means of media transmission. Telephony, radio, microwave, cable television, broadband and fiber optic technologies are not information content technologies as the author describes them. They are merely hardware media pipes for the transmission of information by those who use the media, but not necessarily by those who supply the facilities.

There is no doubt media technology can be supplied from alternative sources; and no doubt that companies, like AT&T, have monopolized the supply of telephony, but not for the reasons the author describes. The factual reasons for limited competition in telephony, radio, and CATV, as described in this book, are for the most part erroneous. The inclusion of the motion picture industry is confusing. The industry would clearly agree that it provides entertainment, but has never claimed to be a purveyor of information content, except as art sometimes conveys insights into human nature.

The author promulgates the theory that when technology advances come along they are open to all providers, but rapidly come under the control of a single or few suppliers that close off the technology to a multiplicity of competitive vendors. For the author, this means control of the information content that goes over the lines, with the potential for that control to cut off information transmitted over the lines. For example, the author creates the impression that because AT&T has a monopoly over telephone services, it has the power to control or cut off the distribution of information. This view overlooks the fact the AT&T, as a public utility, is required by law to provide non-discriminatory service to all buyers, and, with minor exception, is not legally allowed to interfere with the transmission of information content.

The author's theory of closed markets rapidly expands into the story of radio and cable conglomerates, and becomes the reason, albeit a false reason, why the government filed an antitrust case against AT&T to break up the company. The story is entirely fictional, just as the emergence of RCA and NBC are fun stories, but nevertheless fictions. The story of the motion picture industry is similarly entertaining, but has nothing to do with the control of information content unless one confuses program distribution over communication lines with information content.

In a society that likes the preservation of competition as a paramount model for the economy, this book serves to let us know that the monopoly or oligopolistic control of information is dangerous. But as a description of the economic realities the book tries to describe, the author misses the target by a wide mark. His examples of information content controls bear little relationship to the corporations he describes.",29

This is an EXTREMELY broad and deep subject and its treatment as an ever-accelerating history --from unexpected complexities of African drums,
to the subtleties of Morse's and other codes, to the exponentially growing and overwhelming surfeit of ubiquitous information today-- serves as a
beautifully well-integrated, lucid and comprehensible foundation for the expertly crafted centerpiece: Claude Shannon's Theory of Information.

To tie together the totality of the technology that is most central to the 21st Century with the encoding of the double helix 21 million centuries ago
(an approximation, assuming RNA preceded DNA as Life's Secret Decoder Ring for about half of its history,) could take as many volumes as
Gibbon's, Wells' or Churchill's histories. Yet with the finesse of the ever-so-clever encoding that lets us put all nine of Ludwig's symphonies in
perfect precision on a 100mm-diameter piece of plastic or compress a 1+Gigabit/second 1080i streaming video into the 20 Mbit/s MPEG

I started reading this because I read Gleick's Chaos and remember liking it (though it was something over 20 years ago, so I don't remember the details).

Seife's book covers does a *much* better job of explaining, mainly with thought experiments, how information theory relates to relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. I'm sure that the real science of information theory is much more technical than what Seife presents, but Gleick basically glosses over these issues by comparison.

Gleick's book is longer than Seife's and has more historical context. It also covers more ground, though long chunks of it seem only tenuously connected with information theory. I enjoyed reading about the historical actors concerned with computation, cryptography, etc, but wish he would have dealt more with the subject of their investigations. I found a few chapters long-winded and boring - with a lot of flowery words and little substance. The Prologue and Epilogue were particularly hard to slog through - I learned that ""information"" is really important today because of the internet. Does this have anything much to do with information theory? I never found out.

Both books do a poor job, for me, in their attempts to connect information theory to evolutionary biology. Sure, DNA is ""information"" and it is like a ""code."" But what do the findings of information theory tell us about evolution beyond loose analogy? Neither book provides much of an answer.

Gleick does a particularly bad job with his chapters on evolutionary biology and cultural evolution. It seems like he read Dawkins's 1979 popular science book, The Selfish Gene, summarized it, and then ignored any research into evolutionary biology conducted before or since. For example, one gets the impression, from reading Gleick, that Dawkins invented the concept of kin selection (he didn't any more than Gleick invented the theory of relativity) and that Dawkin's ""memes"" are the first and last word on cultural evolution (they aren't - see Laland and Brown's Sense and Nonsense for more). I found this very unsatisfying since my main interest in information theory is its connection to evolutionary theory.",7
foamhead,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood",The information: Best science book I have read in 10 years.,"Terrific, though provoking, mind expanding summary of the evolution of both the framing, storing and theory of information, ranging from the early adoption of the written word to DNA and genetics and naturally to IT, as we now know it. Takes a while to read through, I occasionally had to reread a paragraph several times to understand the inference of a particular point (particularly when it came to Godel, Shannon and information entropy) but it is worth the effort!
Well written, but definitely a book to savour and mull about, not something you can skim.",1
Phil Nova,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood",History? Check. Theory? Check! But where's the Flood?,"Other reviewers have already gone into detail regarding the subject of the book, so I won't belabor that here. The author jumps from talking drums to the telegram to Charles Babbage to transistors, and Gleick is so good at drawing connections between these subjects that it never feels disjointed. It's a really masterful demonstration of how to weave biography, science, and history into one satisfying whole. As a reader with a technical background but no knowledge of the subject, I appreciated the level of rigor in the theoretical sections of the book, although I could see how it might alienate non-techie readers. My advice to them is: read this book anyway, and if it gets too dense, just skip ahead. It's too important, and too well-written, to miss entirely.

The book is divided into three sections, and each considers a different question. The ""History"" section asks: how does the way information is transmitted affect the way we think? One of Gleick's major theses here is that formal logic is a byproduct of written language, and he is very convincing on this point. Another very compelling section was the stuff about early computers, and the story of Babbage and Lady Ada. Gleick has a gift for making scientists relateable, and his enthusiasm for unconventional thinking is contagious.

The ""Theory"" section spells out Shannon's information theory, and brings some much-needed attention to the work of the most influential scientist you've never heard of. As I've said, this part can be a bit technical, which I appreciated, but if that's not your style, you can skim parts of this section without losing the major points. The description of Turing machines was also a highlight. Gleick's exuberant descriptions give the reader a sense of the excitement that the scientists themselves must have felt as they created these deceptively simple, staggeringly powerful theories.

Then... the ""Flood."" I'm a huge fan of Gleick's, but he really dropped the ball on this one. Ostensibly the last section of the book deals with the modern problem of data deluge, but it's a disappointment: there's little research or actual information, and plenty of conflicted hand-wringing. It almost seemed like it had been tacked on by another author. To some extent, this is okay -- data deluge isn't really what this book is meant to be about -- but given how big of a part this section plays in the marketing of the book, I would have preferred that Gleick just left it out entirely and shifted his focus to the book's much stronger sections.

The ""Flood"" section isn't bad, necessarily, just a disappointment compared to the quality and depth of the first two sections. Luckily, it doesn't detract much -- just don't expect more than a cursory look at data deluge from this particular book.

All in all, a very strong popular science book (which could just as reasonably be called a history book). If you're a pop science fan, you're probably familiar with some of the ideas and events described here, but only the very rare reader won't have something new and exciting to discover. It's mostly accessible to non-geeks, too; just plan on skimming the occasional section if you're hopelessly math-averse.",2
LittleMac,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood","Enjoyable, very well written, history of information technology","The is the first James Gleick work that I have read. I am impressed. He writes cleanly and clearly, with little ""fluff"" and he seems to understand what he is writing about. It surely took a lot of background work before he was ready to tie so many disparate pieces of history together. I am also impressed in that Mr Gleick seems clearly to want to get the history right and not to push his personal ideas, interpretations, morals, and politics. I am reminded of the James Burke (BBC/PBS) works as he shows how knowledge that at first seems unrelated becomes related thru the work of many men and women scattered in time and geography. This is a history, not a textbook on information theory; there is only a smattering of simple formulae and drawings.

The book uses the contributions of Claude Shannon as a thread to tie everyone's work together, but this is not a biography of Claude Shannon.

The final chapters are a bit weak in my opinion, especially following such solid work as the preceding chapters. One of the weak (in my opinion) chapters is devoted entirely to Wikipedia. I am enthused with Wikipedia but I don't think it is yet clear what will be a future historian's view of Wikipedia and that it deserves its own full chapter.

Overall I found the book to be very enjoyable and educational, adding considerably to my previous knowledge of Mr Shannon's work and bringing me new knowledge of how Mr Shannon's work linked with the work of others to bring us our current ""information age.""",4
Juan-Pablo Caceres,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood",Information and its Entropy (or how we extract wisdom from a flood of data),"There are two milestones that shape the main theses in this book. The first is, naturally, Claude Shannon's formulation of his ""Information Theory"". Shannon is rightfully the main character of this historical saga (Gleick inserts biographical snippets of him and other main character throughout the book). The second pivotal moment comes with the intrusion of entropy in this theory and in the realization that information, as a physical entity, is also subjected to it.

Gleick is a great writer and a pleasure to read. He presents his topic thematically, chronologically, and inserting biographical elements to shape something like an informational saga. He not only engages the reader but also explain difficult concepts in great detail (his presentation of Gödel's incompleteness theorems is an example.)

With an intermixture of Entropy and Information Gleick discusses the most important issue from a human perspective: how to extract knowledge and wisdom from a flood of data. It is very interesting to realize that our modern discussion is just a last iteration of searching and filtering. From library indexing, book catalogs, almanacs through our modern Internet algorithms, the problem remains the same: when all information is available, how do you find it and when does it become meaningful? The author is right in using Borges's ""The Library of Babel"" as the perfect metaphor for it.",1
Rosie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood","charming, eclectic and very informative","I wondered what aspect of information Gleick would be treating - knowledge and its communication and storage, the rise of information in physics as a conceptual inverse to entropy and its engagement in black hole theory, or even the information age.

My complete satisfaction with Gleick's past work, especially the thoroughness of his notes and his eclectic exposition, compelled me to preorder this book. The Information is all of the above and more. He presents a history, including the fundamentals of language as, for example, employed for millennia by African drummers, then traverses the history of writing (even spelling), difference and analysis engines to the evolution of telegraphs and telephony. The theory then champions the work of Godel, Turing, Shannon, von Neumann and Wiener as information takes on a physical context and leaps into the age of digital logic. Gleick's notes became my list for texts to further read around the topic. Then comes the flood, the rise on the internet, Wiki and the cloud.

The Information is a rewarding and enjoyable read and contains many of the charming minutiae that Gleick's research uncovers. As he listed the objectives of Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica and its imminent demolition, Gleick describes the early days of the demolisher, Godel, attending smoky Viennese coffee houses and expounding logic. Highly recommended.",1
Ben Rothfeld,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood",Not as great as his other books,"If you're expecting another ""Chaos"" or ""Genius,"" you might not like this book.

Partially, Gleick gets into the weeds on quantum mechanics, which is a topic I simply can't grasp. But the main thesis is that information theory has penetrated many areas beyond communications and engineering, which is interesting.

What's missing, I think, is the rich history that he typically delivers. This history tends to give excellent context for the subject. I was expecting to hear, for instance, about how the telegraph or the telephone radically transformed the spread of information. By and large, the book merely nodded at those points.

I would recommend, however, reading the chapter on African drums. That's worth the price of admission.",1
Edoardo Angeloni,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood",The competence of Gleick is very strong.,"In the first chapters, Gleick talks longer about the historical origins of the logics. The ancient people learned their language in typical sitiìuations of the life.
In the 1700-1800 it starts the Industrial Revolution with a particular form of tecnology, that step-by-step becomes always more important.
The first computers, those had an exit very slowly, are early substituded by the modern computers.
This fact follows by a research very strong, particullarly by the works of Shannon, von Neumann,Wiener.
Gleick moves himself in this back-ground in an intelligent way: he talks with competence about the matematical theory and the phylosophical aspects.
It is important for the actual research also the relation between logics and biology, what that is named ""complexity theory"".",1
Gary Smith,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood",A readable overview of all things information,"James Gleick is one of our best science writers. The information is a sprawling book covering information theory and many related subjects. I found it a fascinating read and enjoyed the historical anecdotes about the early luminaries of the field. The section on Charles Babbage and Ada Byron was particularly interesting. The period just after WWII saw spectacular advances in this area, including Shannon's information theory, Turing's universal machine, Von Neumann and Morgenstern's work on game theory and Gleick covers it well.

I found that the book bogged down somewhat after that. I never believed the concept of memes was useful and Gleick's chapter on it did little to convince me. I also found the last few sections, which try to make sense of meaning as opposed to information unsatisfying.

Overall though, an important and readable synthesis of the field for non-specialists.",1

This history of gathering, processing, categorizing, and replicating information is deep in every sense of the word, but so beautifully and clearly written that one gets swept along in it, much like the rivers of numbers and other data Gleick so ably describes.

There are innumerable fascinating anecdotes illustrating the lives and careers of men like Charles Babbage, Alan Turing, and Norbert Wiener as well as inventions and developments like the original telegraph system, ENIAC, and Wikipedia. But I found most appealing and astounding Glieck's ability to so beautifully describe the work of these men that even a math-phobic of long standing like me could understand and grasp at least a hint what so fascinated them.",1

The book starts with the introduction of the byte at Bell Labs, then a story about talking drums is told. After that we move on to the story of Morse code, and then on to Table Alphabeticall.

The stories continue as the walk through the history of information which lands us in today's flood of information and our modern day library of Babel.

One of the most interesting chapters to me was Entropy and its Demons.

Martin Zook,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood",Your Guide to the Universe,"The Information, extraordinary for its universal breadth and depth, is an outstanding survey of the Information Age, its roots, growth, and fruition. In the words of Seth Lloyd: ""To do anything requires energy. To specify what is done requires information."" And that is what Gleick quite successfully sets out to do: specify what the Information Age is all about.

Where others - McLuhan say - offer their own insights, Gleick integrates the findings of philosophers, mathematicians, physicists, biologists, engineers, explorers, authors, and those who have implemented information technologies over the millennia into the mandala of his text. Despite this comprehensiveness and a dash of math, The Information is well within the grasp of a thoughtful general readership.

Information development and proliferation is examined from two necessary perspectives: mechanical and meaning, the yin and yang of communications. Mechanical covers how information is conveyed including physics governing the origination, transmission, and duplication at the receiving end. For those familiar with Claude Shannon's work, Gleick gives much play to the work of the father of Information theory, including the link with meaning - the recognition that the degree of uncertainty heightens the value of the information.

It seems to me - and this is the reader speaking not to be confused with Gleick or any of his sources - that when applied to meaning, that understanding how uncertainty affects information can go a long way to explaining how misinformation can be so widely circulated during the information age. On the one hand, many people are uncomfortable with the tsunami of information that defines our time, and they seek out the newest (most uncertain) information that supports the maintenance of their comfort zones. Hence it's possible for organizations such as Fox and its phalanx of seemingly insane commentators to continually replicate information with a high degree of uncertainty that can be perpetuated endlessly and without being devalued. Refuting it only increases misinformation's uncertainty and high value. The same principal obviously applies at least to a degree to many religions, propaganda, and information promoting a point of view or an agenda.

The chapters delving into meaning, including the fantastic Into the Meme Pool, will have the widest appeal to general readers such as myself. Gleick immediately introduces us to the proposition offered by the Frenchman Jacques Monod that above the biosphere is an ""abstract kingdom"" of ideas, which are re cognized as replicating, living organisms: ""they tend to perpetuate their structure and to breed; they too can fuse, recombine, segregate their content; indeed they too can evolve, and in this evolution selection must surely play an important role."" It should be added that information technology itself guides, sometimes controls, but is never absent from that selection process.

Gleick also gives generous play to the works of Douglas Hofstadter and Richard Dawkins in this adventuresome exploration of organic thoughts.

When it comes to regarding the flood of information that typifies the Information Age, Gleick offers two defenses against being overwhelmed: search and filter. As someone who makes his living figuratively chopping wood and hauling water in the Information Age, I can't argue with that sparse comfort.

But my heart soars like a hawk when Gleick invokes Lewis Mumford: ""Unfortunately, information retrieving, however swift, is no substitute for discovering by direct personal inspection knowledge whose very existence one had possibly never been aware of, and following it at one's own pace through the further ramification of relevant literature.""

Ultimately, Gleick invokes Marshall McLuhan: ""'we have extended our central nervous systems in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is concerned. Rapidly we approach the final phase of the extensions of man - the technological simulation of consciousness, when the creative process of knowing will be collectively and corporately extended to the whole of human society.'""

Books with thought and insight at their heart are a great reward for me, and The Information is a most rewarding read.",5

harborsparrow,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood",It has great moments,"Gleich has a remarkable ability to explain science. Here, he takes on the ambitious task of tying in research from linguistics, theoretical physics, molecular biology and computer science. As other reviewers have mentioned, this book is appropriate for scientists in areas where information theory overlaps.

As a history, it has great moments, interspersed IMO by long-winded indulgent sequences that could have been edited down with little loss to the book.

In the last quarter of the book, I was stunned to find two glaring, well, errors. Gleich attributes the creation of Wikipedia solely to Jimbo Wales. Perhaps he and his editors have been living under a rock? Larry Sanger co-founded Wikipedia with Wales, and that is a widely known fact despite Wales' attempts to hog all the credit. Furthermore, Gleich attributes ""Moore's Law"" solely to Gordon Moore, when again, in computer science it is widely recognized that although this rule of thumb got Moore's name, he did not originate the idea. These serious glitches made me wonder how much of the other history, with which I am not as familiar, has similarly glaring biases. It made me doubt the rest of the book.

Still, because of its real high points and the difficulty of the attempted fusion of ideas across fields in a useful way, I'll give it a four. Really 3.5, but if I must round, I'll go up because of the difficulty level.",4

Whether the universe is based upon information is not a certainty, but it is an interesting and provacative thought that deserves time and attention.",1
Spk,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood","""IT IS BIT""","I would like to recommend this book by James Gleick - which I just read on my iPad.

You might recall that in the 80s Gleick wrote the `Chaos' that laid out Complexity Theory to popular audiences. Words like Strange Attractor, Butterfly Effect, Fractals and Mandelbrot joined the popular culture. It was such a sensation that folks created music and paintings of complexity theory images! He also wrote a book on Richard Feynman titled `Genius' and another one on Isaac Newton - both terrific reads.

This new book, ""The Information,"" is an excellent read. He introduces us to Claude Shannon, the father of information theory - whose master's thesis at MIT is considered by professionals as the `single most significant work in the 20th century' - a century that included Einstein! Claude Shannon was raised in Gaylord, MI and went to U. of M.

The book shows how Claude Shannon precisely defines the word `information', just like Newton precisely defined the words Mass, Time and Force. The fruits of the digital revolution that we enjoy today can be traced directly back to Claude Shannon's seminal work at the Bell Labs.

There is a brief YouTube video produced by U.C. Television on Claude Shannon that is worth a watch.

The eminent Physicist Wheeler spent time with Claude Shannon at Princeton, and was impressed with him. Towards the end of his life, acknowledging Shannon's work, Wheeler says, ""It is bit.' Meaning that the world (it) that Physicists are trying to describe is really `bit' (information). Which is in a way is a strange echo of an old saying in Sanskrit from India - `You are It.' This phrase meaning that there is no difference between the individual and nature. So I put these two statements together to derive the following corollary - You are a Bit (!) - meaning we are all pieces of information! :-)

Gleick however points out a potentially troubling consequence to Shannon's work. What Shannon did was to explicitly separate meaning from data. Thus the digital revolution is efficient, mechanized and far reaching. However it seems that the task of 21st century leadership is to forcefully connect meaning back to data.

As far as the overall book is concerned, it would be a disservice to say it is a book about Claude Shannon. I would suggest that the author uses Claude Shannon as a narrative device around which to spin this fascinating tale. Indeed he goes farther back than Plato and Socrates in History and as far away as African Tribal drummers through to Charles Babbage and Alan Turing. He traces the digital revolution past its seminal inception at the Bell Labs and carries out forward to the flood we are experiencing today. And leaves us at the precipice of a new world wondering what new turns await us next.

I feel like not just crediting Gleick for this well written book, but celebrate a writer who can maintain such a high standard of science writing for over thirty years.",16

Jean-Guy Rens,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood",Lack of coherence,"Being myself a former Bell employee I bought ""The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood"" as soon as I read the review in ""The New York Times"". Began with the greatest interest, I quickly became dismayed when after a brief prologue on-focus, James Gleick goes to visit the language of African drums, not that the subject is uninteresting, but not during 20 pages. In the same chapter, he jumps suddenly to ""Samuel Morse struggling with his own percussive code, the electromagnetic drumbeat designed to pulse along the telegraph wire."" And thereafter another chapter on the birth of cuneiforms in Sumer, the cultural discontinuity brought by writing in ancient oral civilizations and the reluctance shown by Plato vis-a-vis the written text. Isn't it enough? Comes a long digression on the invention of the first English dictionary in 1613 by an obscure priest under the title ""A Table Alphabeticall, conteyning and teaching the true writing, and understanding of hard usuall English wordes"". Interesting? Maybe, but what is the connection with the Information Theory?

Again, all these developments are intrinsically interesting and by times even fascinating (like the section on Babbage and Ada de Lovelace), but they dilute our interest and soon we loose track of the theme of the book which was supposed to be the information theory. When Gleick finally tackles his subject, we are already at chapter 7, and of course he speaks about the encounter of Claude Shannon with Alan Turing. We learn much more on the beauty of Turing's decyphering than about Shannon's Information theory. And Gleick goes on and on for another 8 chapters musing about Maxwell's demon and entropy... Gleick is his worse enemy. He is an erudite and it shows! But he does not know how to follow a demonstration order. Logic is not his forte. He needs a good editor.",18
Antonio,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood",The Information: the disappointment,"The book is titled ""The Information"" as an acknowledgement that information is an all-important concept in today's world. Unfortunately, it is also all-encompassing and used by different people to mean somewhat related, but different things. I was expecting the book to explain, if not what information *is* (there is no real agreement on that yet), at least some insights into its nature. Instead, we are given some (very nice) stories about researchers (from Morse to Shannon). Very well written, very entertaining, but anecdotal in nature, and very incomplete: there is way more to the concept of information that Shannon's theory (Shannon himself was the first one to make clear that he had limited his theory to some aspects of information encoding and transmission. In fact, he thought that ""Information Theory"" was a misnomer, and indeed it is). The book does offer some insight into Shannon's theory and related areas, including the use of information-theoretic concepts in physics and biology. However, other books have done this before and, in my opinion, better. In particular, the connection with 'entropy' in physics is not nearly as clear cut as the author makes it to be. All in all, if you already know a bit about Shannon's theory and have read some of these other books, I think this one will be disappointing. It's still a nice read -just does not have much *information* on it...",23
H. M. Gladney,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood","Good history, weak epistemology","As many popular authors do, Gleick is hiding his e-mail address. Although this is understandable, it also blocks meaningful dialogue with scholars who understand his topics as well as he does. ==> It is necessary to publish the following critique broadly instead of discussing it quietly with the author.

As good as the book is as a historical chronicle, it repeated suffers from unwarranted obfuscation--in this case failure to identify a thoroughly understood epistemological topic in clear, readily-understood language in favor of elevating it to something seemingly mysterious.

The question I have in mind is the distinction between objects and values. (E.g., the number 5 is not an object, but rather a value which is shared by all sets that contain exactly five members.) The obfuscations I charge Gleick with are particularly prominent in his Chapter 9, ""Entropy and Its Demons"". which concludes with, ""Most of the biosphere cannot see the infosphere: it is invisible, a parallel universe humming with ghostly inhabitants. But they are not ghosts to us ..."".

All this b.s. (an appropriate appellation) would vanish if Gleick simply pointed out that early 20th-century philosophers (Bertrand Russell, WIttgenstein, and their predecessors and successors in epistemology) understood and commented on the distinction.

This weakness makes the book misleading--sufficiently so that I recommend against anybody trying to understand information theory from spending time with it.",7

James Gleick is a good writer. But he doesn't have a whole lot to say, here. One thing he does in this book is draw a distinction -- or rather highlight someone else's distinction -- between ""information"" and ""meaning"". This book has a fair amount of the former, not enough of the latter.

I learned the term ""noosphere"". And the book gave me a keener appreciation for the degree of information pollution that has arisen from the latest leaps in technology that make it easier than ever for anyone to disseminate anything: I will think harder before publishing just any old blog post. I even thought hard before posting this review! This is not a bad book, but the ratio of text to meaning is annoyingly high. The acknowledgements, notes, bibliography, and index comprise more than 40% of the book's length.

Mark Stahlman,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood",All Message: No Medium for Understanding,"Unfortunately, James Gleick has missed a great opportunity with this one. Like many generalists, he got bogged down in the details of topics he doesn't have a grounding in (i.e. information theory) and missed the relevance of the cultural transformation that is happening all around him (i.e. digital social media.)

He doesn't Twitter. He writes long books. Fine. But since his Epilogue is titled ""The Return of Meaning"" he owes it to those who get to the end to express something meaningful. Instead it seems he was overwhelmed by ""the"" information.

This problem is particularly painful when it comes to Marshall McLuhan -- who is his constant foil from the beginning (on page 8) to the end (on page 413), with 16 more mentions in between. Gleick apparently doesn't like McLuhan. That's okay but he owes it to his readers to at least ""get"" McLuhan straightened out. Instead he confuses things completely by claiming that McLuhan was both the ""spokesman"" for pre-Christian oral culture and also in the ""service of modernity"" (page 48). If that contradiction wasn't bad enough, he also correctly noted that McLuhan was a Catholic, which actually means in McLuhan's case that he believed Christianity was ""better"" than paganism and that ""modernism"" was the enemy of the Church -- not something he could ""serve.""

This basic confusion about the only personage who is mentioned throughout the book casts doubt on his knowledge of the others he writes about. This book is the author's own personal message and it seems that he hasn't done the research to provide a medium for his readers to understand the subject.",61

Daniel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Information Theory: A Tutorial Introduction,The most clear explanation - applicable to all - of any mathematical topic to date,"Whether you are just beginning your relationship with mathematics or you are a theoretical mathematician working on the applications of knot theory to 4D topology, you have something to gain from this book.

Mathematics is hard. The language in which mathematicians describe their work only compounds the difficulty of learning math for few are fluent in this succinct language. Unfortunately, it is this language almost all introductory mathematical textbooks inevitably conform to, at the cost of the reader's comprehension. Dr. Stone, overcomes this language rift by explaining the math in a friendly, familiar way. He further takes the care to ensure appropriate time is spent clarifying each topic in a variety of ways (in case one does not make much sense). Stone also provides appendices as reference for the reader who may need more explanation or refreshers. This kind of guidance through mathematical theory is inherently absent in the mathematical language as its core is precision, brevity, and removal of all redundancy.

It is his very thoughtful explanation and walkthrough which makes me confidence to say that Dr. James V Stone's introduction to information theory is conceivably the best book I have read; not just in regards to information theory but in regards to mathematics (applied or otherwise) as a whole.
The reader is guided through Shannon's seminal work in a way that is applicable regardless of the reader's background (mathematics, art, biology, journalism, etc). Dr. Stone helps the reader develop an intuition for information theory.

The feeling of such a clear and expounded grasp on a mathematical field is so rare currently that this feeling is most difficult to describe other than you'll ""just get it."" If you have had minimal exposure to math, are helplessly confused by proofs, feel like you just never understand, this book is for you. This book is equally applicable to those versed in mathematics, as it provides an understanding that is often disjoint from a theoretical approach.

Consider how many people utilize ""basic"" mathematics to help them approach and solve questions in their daily life intuitive like e.g. if I make $x per month, how much do I earn per week? Of my weekly earnings, if I set aside y for groceries and z for savings, how much do I have left to spend?
The commonplaceness of applying math in this way, by understanding the concepts behind the math, rather than just plugging into a formula is exactly what you can expect to gain from reading Dr. Stone's book. By the end of even the first section of the first chapter, the reader may find that they are already grasping this intuitive understanding, and applying it to the world around them. Dr. Stone helps the reader integrate the core concepts of information theory so that the math behind it becomes a tool for the reader to use, rather than to be perplexed by.

The book is a joy to read, and a privilege to learn from.

For those who have read the review this far, I study mathematics and neuroscience. As such, I have read my fair share of mathematical textbooks, mathematical introductions, and mathematical books for ""dummies"" (as I often feel myself). In my experience math never stops being complex, and try as many might to simply it, none have succeeded as well as Dr. Stone. I was versed in information theory before reading this book. The intuition and deep understanding / appreciation for this field that I have gained from the book is unheard-of. It is intuition that makes a great mathematician, and this book will teach you to think intuitively. The clarity of Dr. Stone's work is so profound I have little other way to describe how accessible it is to all walks of life.

While many may not consider this a ""mathematical textbook,"" let Dr. Stone's style be an example for how math should initially be taught. This book works well as a standalone text, and as a supplement to more intricate texts in regard to information theory. Do not let the title introduction fool you, Dr. Stone manages to maintain the intricacies of the field in a way often overlooked.",28
Julio Cesar Campos Neto,5.0 out of 5 stars,Information Theory: A Tutorial Introduction,Very good first book to read on information theory.,"Since ive read James Stones Bayes's Rule: A tutorial introduction Ive been waiting this book with great expectation and the author didn't let me down.

Its a natural step after reading Pierce's Book on information theory or as a Information theory first book before digging deep on other books as Cover etc. The first 4 chapters deal with the discrete version of information theory and its main concept, entropy. It gives several examples and clear explanations without avoiding the math/formulas. After that it goes on the continuous case and does a good job too.

Even tough the author does offer a good revision material on probability(CDF, PDF, etc) as appendix, if you have never seen these terms before, I would advise to take a probability class to take full advantage of the book.",10

Ronnie Gonzalez,3.0 out of 5 stars,Information Theory: A Tutorial Introduction,Not So User-Friendly As the Author Thinks,"This is good writing, but it's not as clear as Dr. Stone would like to think it is -- it is still very blindly procedural, and there is an error in the binary coding chart on page 72, where x4 should be 011, not 111.

Things could be simplified and brought much more greatly down to earth. For example, you can just come out and say that logarithms are for extracting exponents from a number, given some respective base term. You could say it's analogous to a juicing machine or something, but Stone isn't interested in making things that user-friendly. Also, and beyond even this, it looks like applying the logarithm and extracting the exponents translates directly into how many input (bus) lanes you should be plugging into a circuit. For example, if you need eight possible combinations and you're dealing in a binary electrical input system, you can just apply the base-two logarithm to eight, extract the exponent of three, and that number three tells you directly how many input lanes would allow you to have eight total possible combinations.

It's just that down-to-earth -- or at least it can be, if your desire is truly to make the reader understand, rather than put them through a clumsy gauntlet of feeling stupid until they somehow magically manage to intuit what I've just explained. In other words, Stone's approach could stand to be a whole lot more user-friendly, without sacrificing very much accuracy, if any, at all.",4

Jeffrey P. Goldberg,5.0 out of 5 stars,Understanding Cryptography: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners,Outstanding for self study,"If you've heard people mention things like ECC, HMACs, discrete logarithms and wanted to what they were talking about; or if you wanted to understand who RSA and AES really work along with many other things, then this is the book for you.

I had been hunting for something more current than the 1996 Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C, Second Edition when I came across Understanding Cryptography. I could tell from the available samples and the table of contents, that it should meet my needs. It has not only met my needs, but has exceeded them in every respect.

This book was absolutely perfect for me, so it would be of some use for you to know my background.
I've long had an interest in cryptography but never any training. When I read Martin Gardener's famous 1977 article on RSA I thought it was the coolest thing ever, but I didn't fully grasp it and didn't pursue it at the time. In college I studied some math, but my degree is in linguistics, not in math or computing. I have read popularizations of cryptography, and had tried to make it though Applied Cryptography when it first came out in 1996, but I can't say that I really understood how the algorithms and the more intricate protocols worked. So that is roughly my background.

One of the great things about Understanding Cryptography is that it taught me exactly the math that I needed. You need to be comfortable learning new math. (I also found that I had to brush up on basic linear algebra on my own to understand one component of the deals of AES).

Working though this book on my own through self study took time. It is extremely well presented (with the possible exception of the final chapter, which could do with another round of copy-editing). The subject matter is not simple, so if you really wish to understand them you need to go through things very slowly, stopping frequently to check understanding, but everything you need is in the book without it being overly long. The excellent organization and presentation of the material means that I was able to get far, far more out of this book than anything else I have read on the topic.

The problem sets at the end of each chapter progress from easy to more challenging. I still need to go back and take on some of the more challenging ones I skipped the first time through. Often I was too eager to get to the new chapter than to work through the problems. As a consequence I missed some of the extended material that was presented through those problems sets.

Personally, my second favorite chapter is the chapter on AES which really steps through how it works and why each component does what it does. My favorite is the chapter on ECC. I had known wat ECC was used for, but before reading this, I had no idea of what it really was. Now I find it ""the coolest thing ever"". (OK, I may over use that phrase.) The authors' presentation of it is just right. They lead you though the process so that you can share in the delight of how ECC works.

Although I have worked though this as complete self-study, I would have preferred to do this as part of a class or at least some study group. Sometimes because I could have more quickly gotten through things that I held me up a few times, but mostly because I would have liked to share the experience. My wife and daughter are not entirely happy with the fact that I've been trying to teach them bits of what I've been learning over the month.

There are still bits that I don't fully understand. Some are questions not addressed in the book, but the further readings and bibliography are excellent. So I have the resources to investigate those. There are also bits that I don't fully understand because I haven't gone back and worked through the relevant exercises in the problem sets.

What I would like to see in a second addition:

(1) A bibliography for each chapter as well as the comprehensive one at the end
(2) A reworking of the final chapter, which appears rushed and not as well presented as everything else
(3) More on hash functions reflecting what is being learned now as part of the SHA3 process.

I am sure that this makes an outstanding textbook for a college course in the matter, but I want to add that it is so clearly presented, organized with introductions to the necessary math that it works for self-study as well.",38

Aniketos,5.0 out of 5 stars,Understanding Cryptography: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners,By far the best despite all the errors,"I read this book as someone with a maths degree and someone familiar with cryptography to see how its treatment compares to more popular books.

In brief, this book will take you through from the very basics, such as stream ciphers (briefly), to specific and very common examples of block ciphers such as AES and DES -- each of which is given its own chapter. Though some implementation details are left out, for example, it would not have been too difficult to explain how the steps of an AES round could be combined into a single operations involving look up tables and exclusive ORs. It would have added at most 2 pages and would have made the reader more familiar with the Galios Field mathematics involved. The later chapters of the book deal with public-private key encryption, certificates, hashes, MACs and a brief introduction to elliptical curves.

Unfortunately, this book has a lot of mistakes so you cannot rely on it with authority. For example, even the Miller-Rabin algorithm is not stated correctly and some coefficients of various algorithms are written incorrectly. If you're looking for a reference, look on, at least maybe until the 2nd edition.

Despite the mistakes, I can't bear to give this book a 4 star rating. It definitely deserves 5 stars and rest assured, when you start to read this book you will not feel like stopping. The authors use plenty of real world stories to keep you going each time, it is paced masterfully. Every chapter is motivated well, every example and exercise serves a point. It would be great if the authors could write another book discussing authentication protocols and the practical implementation side of things (such as things like cache timing attacks).",3

I really enjoy math and might be taking my math skills for granted. Just so I am clear, this is a Math textbook, which means the encryption algorithms are formally defined using math notation. However, the author's explanation of the math & algorithms is the most clear and easy to understand I have ever seen; which to me means, you do not need a strong background in mathematics to understand this material.)

I personally do not care for analogies in cryptography books. If the author knows what he is talking about and can explain it, there is absolutely no need for stupid analogies. Another thing that drives me crazy is authors that ""challenge you to think"" too much. They can never get to the point and come right out and tell you something. Half the time, I can't figure out if they actually either do not know what they are talking about, or they simply do not know how to explain something and hide it behind a series of challenging questions...which they themselves cannot answer(as if to be objective or something). Frankly, I am a professional with over 10 years of experience. I do not buy books so that authors can beat around the bush with their knowledge; which, by the way, I find condescending, because they are supposed to be the experts. When I pay money for a technical book, I do it with the expectation that the author is knowledgeable, qualified to write about the topic, and will not waste my time playing mind games with me. That is what is so surprising about this book; it clearly says ""textbook"" on the cover, which made me hesitate, thinking... maybe this is too elementary, or like many college textbooks, challenges you to think too much. However, contrary to my concerns, this book is to the point and carefully explains details that other authors seem to miss. In addition, it is very practical coverage and still challenging enough to be motivational, in other words, you do not have to drink twelve cups of coffee just to get through it. To summarize this section, at this stage in my career, I really appreciate authors that can ""thoroughly explain things in the fewest possible words, while still being crystal clear!"" (Apparently, this is something I myself cannot do, as evidence above, but that is why I do not write books)

- Organization
Score: 10
I have many cryptography books that talk about critical aspects of the encryption processes in isolation without tying them together; this book is very well organized in that respect.

- Real world Application (i.e. is this how it works in the real world or is this just theory that never gets used in practice)
Score: 9
This is another category that makes this book stand out because the coverage is very practical.

- Thoroughness (i.e. how rigorous is the book, is it a comprehensive review of technologies)
Score: 7
Great Introduction to many areas!

- Application & Implementation on Computer (i.e. code, algorithms, data-types, programming language tips/tricks...etc)
Score: 5
Most books attempt to provide code but the code is based on static input and is poorly written, leaving you to wonder, why on earth they even bothered to try. Actually coding algorithms is not the focus of this book... I don't think it contains one line of code, but you can encrypt and decrypt, end-2-end on paper, if you want to, after reading it. As I mentioned earlier, this is a math book, so the algorithms are presented in mathematical notation.

Edit: I have to add a disclaimer to this review. I originally read this book when I was knee deep in research and loved this book so much because the author tied together some concepts in such a concise explanation. This book is definitely a five star book but now that my initial excitement has worn off I think that some of my claims above may have been overinflated. I would recommend that the reader is comfortable with at least advanced algebra and discrete math. Sorry, I think I drank too much coffee before writing this review. Bottom line, this is not a detailed comprehensive book on cryptography, this is a short, concise, math based explanation about selected topics. The point that I was trying to make is not that this is a thorough book, but this is a high quality explanation of selected topics.",40

I am sure that it will ultimately have very broad base as it is well suited for introductory courses with a variety of goals. Order it! Read some of it! You won't ever consider returning it! The first two chapters were enough to convince me that it will be our text of choice if we decide to follow a Cryptography path as we are considering other routes, such as Apostol's Analytic Number Theory, and Miline's Algebraic Geometry as well.

Andrew Liu,2.0 out of 5 stars,Understanding Cryptography: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners,The Kindle version has confusing typos,"I downloaded the free Kindle sample and found it had many mathematical statements that were not quite correct. The statements confused me on multiple occasions until I figured out they were typos (by comparing with the Look Inside preview on Amazon). The typos are probably caused by someone OCR-ing the textbook to create the Kindle version, and they didn't put any effort in verifying the result. I'm getting the printed book instead.

Laird Taylor,2.0 out of 5 stars,Understanding Cryptography: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners,"Great book, but far too many errors","(My background is in mathematics only.) In general, the book is very well written and understandable and covers, insofar as I understand it, all the major areas of cryptography (but virtually no cryptanalysis). Were it not for the following, I would give the book five stars.

I am puzzled that no one else has mentioned that this book is RIFE with errors. This speaks badly not only for the authors, but also for the publisher. I list a selection of errors, generally putting the most important first. Mathematical typos, which can be difficult to detect by the student, are included if I found them. Other typos are not.

p 280. The code is AWFUL. The FOR variable is explicitly initialized and incremented within the loop. Line 2.3 shows arithmetic to the left of the assignment statement. If the authors insist on using = for assignment in 2.3 instead of the more readable arrow, they do NOT want the triple = sign. The number 4096 really should be explained somewhere.

p190-191. The explanation of Miller Rabin is impossible to understand as written and the code is incorrect (Input 17 and 4 to see that 17 turns out to be composite). Need to add code to leave loop when z = p-1. Language MUST be included somewhere that the code basically does the Fermat check and the check that x^2=1 has only two solutions in a field (i.e. when variable is prime). It should also be mentioned that we are doing no more than exponentiating in the usual squaring and multiplying fashion.

p209 C is NOT, as claimed, a group under complex multiplication; perhaps C – {0} was intended.

p16 The box is headed as the definition of ring. It is not. It is the definition of Z-m. Oddly, commutativity is not mentioned as a property on the next page.

p92 The definition of field does not include commutativity, so it is, instead, the definition of a division ring..

p40 line 7: mod m should be mod 2

p47,57 The terms “primitive polynomial” and “differential cryptanalyis” are used with no attempt at explanation.

p153 3 lines below box. “is a polynomial expression” is technically incorrect: “not bounded above by any polynomial” is much better

p164 2 lines below table: “multiplication” should be “subtraction”

p176 Last line of box is missing a “1”

p186 Shouldn’t speak of a speed-up of by a factor of 4 given the algorithms that are used for multiplication.

p189 line 1.2 in Fermat Primality Test is missing: “mod p tilde”

p267 line 9: replace “decryption” by “encryption”

p 271: Elgamal Signature Generation: remove 0,1 from list of random ephemeral keys

p274: 2nd line in “Reuse…” “a” should be “d” and parentheses needed around “p-1” in four places.

p325: In “The hash output length..”, “Longer” should be replaced with “shorter.”

p359 References: Very strange unreadable non-standard format. No student paper would be accepted with this format. Some items appear to be misplaced.",39

Isaac Chen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seven Databases in Seven Weeks: A Guide to Modern Databases and the NoSQL Movement,Smart but easy to read.,"Usually when I read technical books I feel one of the following:
A. Puzzled that such a book was made since doing a google search is far faster and easier.
B. Recognize that while the book likely makes some great points, the writing only is understandable if you already deeply understand the subject.
C. This must be one of those ""guide for idiots"" books since reading the book only shows some simple basics you would have figured if you just sat down and used the thing for 5 minutes.
But every once in awhile there is a book that is easy to read, doesn't treat me like an idiot, and actually explains the why and just not the what of the subject matter.

Justin Bramley,4.0 out of 5 stars,Seven Databases in Seven Weeks: A Guide to Modern Databases and the NoSQL Movement,"Great information, but distracting at times","There's a lot of good information in here and my eyes have really been opened to the world of NoSQL database solutions and how they compare to the RDBMS world with which I'm much more familiar. The chapters are laid out in a way to show off a lot of the great features, putting you on your feet fast and enabling you to see some of the strengths and weaknesses of the database solutions.

I have two gripes with the book, however. One is that at times, the authors seem to talk more about supporting technologies than the databases themselves. It's nice to see how you can use a SAX-based XML parser with some programming language to load data into the database, but other than the interface to the database itself, it's not wholly relevant to the core topic at hand.

My second gripe is that sometimes the examples feel overly contrived. In the chapter on Riak, for instance there's a comparison of getting counts by style from the database. The method shown for the RDBMS style is something that even if you had only read the chapter on PostgreSQL, you'd know was a terrible way for getting the information. There are a couple of other examples in the book where I found myself saying either, ""well, yeah, but nobody in their right mind would actually do it that way,"" or ""OK, that's nice, but how would this work for a real problem?"" All that being said, this problem is endemic to introductory material in general and so, while frustrated that it is continued in this book, I don't think it detracts from the book anymore than it detracts from any other introductory reading.",27
Erik Gfesser,4.0 out of 5 stars,Seven Databases in Seven Weeks: A Guide to Modern Databases and the NoSQL Movement,Five genres of databases across seven open source products,"Over the past couple years, I have read considerably about non-traditional database products, whether they be categorized as NoSQL or NewSQL, especially the Hadoop ecosystem (see my reviews on ""HBase: The Definitive Guide"" and ""Hadoop in Action""), but I only just recently completed a reading of this book after pre-ordering it over a year ago. I share the sentiment of other reviewers to some extent, in the sense that even though the authors call the content that they offer here a ""crash course workshop"" written for ""experienced developers"", the discussions of each database product vary in terms of the detail and pace at which they are presented. That said, this book does offer a look at the modern database landscape from the perspective of a developer, and presents material on each database product to an extent which prompts the reader to look to other resources for additional detail, a practice to which I have grown accustomed as a consultant, so this aspect of the book is not a negative thing in itself, just something of which readers need to be aware in the case they are not accustomed to this style of presentation.

By this point, there are enough reviewers who have discussed the fact that Redmond and Wilson explore seven open source database products in this book: Redis, Neo4J, CouchDB, MongoDB, HBase, PostgreSQL, and Riak. Since there are literally hundreds of open source database products, it helps to understand the fact that one of the reasons these seven database products was chosen was because they span several genres of database that were designed to solve problems presented by real use cases. PostgreSQL is the one relational database discussed. Riak and Redis are key-value stores, HBase is a column-oriented database, MongoDB and CouchDB are document-oriented databases, and Neo4J is a graph database. Since I have already gained considerable exposure to the Hadoop ecosystem, I concentrated on the six chapters not covering HBase, and in reading the HBase material I can tell you that it really just scratches the service of the product, so this served as a personal reminder of what the authors state multiple times throughout what they have to share here: this is introductory material.

Coverage of each database product follows a similar pattern over hypothetical three-day periods of time. If you are interested in reading this book, do not be intimidated by how the material is laid out according to the calendar. Each set of three days is really just three steps of progression, diving deeper with each step. The only exception to this pattern is coverage of Redis, the last database product covered. While technically the third step of the Redis discussion involves Redis, what it really provides is introductory material on polygot persistence, which involves database products working together. In the example that the authors present, CouchDB is the system of record, Neo4J handles data relationships, and Redis helps with data population and caching. The authors even present a good sidebar on why use of nonblocking code is such an important method when dealing with databases. The wrap-up that follows each three-day time period outlines the the strengths and weaknesses of each database product, and a wrap-up chapter at the end of the book outlines the strengths and weakness of each database genre, followed by an appendix that provides informational tables that compares each of the database products from several different angles.

While HBase is still the database product that attracts the data architecture aspects of my consulting career the most, of the seven database products covered PostgreSQL is the one that I have actually started using, due to practical reasons, but I am also increasingly interested in Neo4J, a graph database product providing full ACID compliant transactions to which I was first exposed at SpringOne a couple years ago. It is interesting that although this book was reasonably targeted at an audience consisting of ""experienced developers"", it is not a stretch to say that many developers naively consider data availability a given on their project assignments, sometimes because they do not want to deal with the data, and sometimes because they think the data is the easy part. Books like this which help bridge the gulf that often exists between those who seem to think that Java or some other language is all that matters in the enterprise, and those who consider the viability of only one database product, serve a great need, and do not fall into the set of O'Reilly texts that have strayed off course in recent years.",2

A Reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,Elements of Information Theory 2nd Edition (Wiley Series in Telecommunications and Signal Processing),An Excellent Introduction to Information Theory,"I am writing this review in response to some confusion and unfairness I see in other reviews. Cover and Thomas have written a unique and ambitious introduction to a fascinating and complex subject; their book must be judged fairly and not compared to other books that have entirely different goals.

Claude Shannon provided a working definition of ""information"" in his seminal 1948 paper, A Mathematical Theory of Communication. Shannon's interest in that and subsequent papers was the attainment of reliable communication in noisy channels. The definition of information that Shannon gave was perfectly fitted to this task; indeed, it is easily shown that in the context studied by Shannon, the only meaningful measure of information content that will apply to random variables with known distribution must be (up to a multiplicative constant) of the now-familiar form h(p) = log(1/p).

However, Shannon freely admitted that his definition of information was limited in scope and was never envisioned as being universal. Shannon deliberately avoided the ""murkier"" aspects of human communication in framing his definitions; problematic themes such as knowledge, semantics, motivations and intentions of the sender and/or receiver, etc., were avoided altogether.

For several decades, Information Theory continued to exist as a subset of the theory of reliable communication. Some classical and highly regarded texts on the subject are Gallager, Ash, Viterbi and Omura, and McEliece. For those whose interest in Information Theory is motivated largely by questions from the field of digital communications, these texts remain unrivalled standards; Gallager, in particular, is so highly regarded by those who learned from it that it is still described as superior to many of its more recent, up-to-date successors.

In recent decades, Information Theory has been applied to problems from across a wide array of academic disciplines. Physicists have been forced to clarify the extent to which information is conserved in order to completely understand black hole dynamics; biologists have found extensive use of Information Theoretic concepts in understanding the human genome; computer scientists have applied Information Theory to complex issues in computational vs. descriptive complexity (the Mandelbrot set, which has been called the most complex set in all of mathematics, is actually extremely simple from the point of view of Kolmogorov complexity); and John von Neumann's brilliant creation, game theory, which has been called ""a universal language for the unification of the behavioral sciences,"" is intimately coupled to Information Theory, perhaps in ways that have not yet been fully appreciated or explored.

Cover and Thomas' book ""Elements of Information Theory"" is written for the reader who is interested in these eclectic and exciting applications of Information Theory. This book does NOT treat Information Theory as a subset of reliable communication theory; therefore, the book is NOT written as a competitor for Gallager's classic text. Critics who ask
for a more thorough treatment of rate distortion theory or convolutional codes are criticizing the authors for failing to include topics that are not even central to their goals for the text!

A very selective list of some of the more interesting topics that Cover and Thomas study includes: (1) the Asymptotic Equipartition Property and its consequences for data compression; (2) Information Theory and gambling; (3) Kolmogorov complexity and Chaitin's Omega; (4) Information Theory and statistics; and (5) Information Theory and the stock market. Item (4) on this list is only briefly introduced in Cover and Thomas's book, and appropriately so; however, readers who wish to pursue the fascinating subject of Fischer Information further should consider B. Roy Frieden's book Physics from Fisher Information: A Unification. Frieden identifies a principle of ""extreme physical information"" as a unifying theme across all of physics, deriving such classic equations as the Klein-Gordon equation, Maxwell's equations, and Einstein's field equations for general relativity from this information-theoretic principle.

This last point is quite typical of Cover and Thomas's book. I participated in a faculty seminar on Information Thoery at my university a few years ago, in which we studied Cover and Thomas as our primary source. We were a diverse group, drawn from five different academic disciplines, and we all found that Cover and Thomas repeatedly introduced us to exciting and unexpected applications of Information Theory, always sending us to the journals for further, more in-depth study.

Cover and Thomas' book has become an established favorite in university courses on information theory. In truth, the book has few competitors. Interested readers looking for additional references might also consider David MacKay's book Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms, which has as a primary goal the use of information theory in the study of Neural Networks and learning algorithms. George Klir's book Uncertainty and Information considers many alternative measures of information/uncertainty, moving far beyond the classical log(1/p) measure of Shannon and the context in which it arose. Jan Kahre's iconoclastic book The Mathematical Theory of Information is an intriguing alternative in which the so-called Law of Diminishing Information is elevated to primary axiomatic status in deriving measures of information content. I alluded to some of the ""murkier"" issues of human communication earlier; readers who wish to study some of those issues will find Yehoshua Bar-Hillel's book Language and Information a useful source.

In conclusion, I highly recommend Cover and Thomas' book on Information Theory. It is currently unrivalled as a rigorous introduction to applications of Information Theory across the curriculum. As a person who used to work in the general area of signals analysis, I resist all comparisons of Cover and Thomas' book with the classic text of Gallager; the books have vastly different goals and very little overlap.",120
Alexander C. Zorach,5.0 out of 5 stars,Elements of Information Theory 2nd Edition (Wiley Series in Telecommunications and Signal Processing),Very solid introductory book on information theory,"I give this book five stars for its outstanding clarity, thoroughness, and choice of topics. The writing is excellent, and most topics are easy to understand, although I have a few isolated quibbles about how certain topics are presented.

I feel like the chapters on continuous channels are much tougher to understand and less intuitive than the chapters on discrete channels.

The exercises are very useful, but in my opinion, a bit too easy. There are lots of exercises at the end of each chapter, but there are very few that require deep thinking or creative insight. Most of the exercises are fairly routine. I think a few more involved ones would be welcome.

The one thing that is most lacking in this book are examples. The bulk of the text is made up in exposition of new ideas and proofs of theorems. While the exercises give lots of examples, I still feel that something is missing--especially in the chapters on continuous channels.

As a supplement, I would recommend ""Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms"" by MacKay. The two books are very different from each other and have less overlap than one might expect; I think everyone would do well to study both books. That book is much more suitable for self-study, has more concrete examples, and is in my opinion more fun and interesting (which says a lot, because this book is itself quite fun and interesting). It also has some more involved exercises. Also, it covers coding theory in more depth than this book (something that one might not realize from its name), and it integrates a Bayesian perspective into things more deeply.",7

Occasionally deep statements are made without much explanation and amplification. It is upto the reader to figure out explanations for these statements. Some of the problems are repeated.

D. J. Peacock,2.0 out of 5 stars,Elements of Information Theory 2nd Edition (Wiley Series in Telecommunications and Signal Processing),Frustrating,"They often use (or overload) notation without first defining it, leaving the reader to guess at what they mean. When this occurred within the text I was usually able to figure it out by deducing definitions based on the results obtained with them, but it added unnecessary difficulty to reading the text and negated any illustrative value the example would have provided. Worse, they also did this in the problems. I never once had to obtain help solving the problems, but frequently had to obtain clarification of what the problems were asking.

The proofs often skip steps and omit justifications for most steps, including keystone steps of the proof. I would not have been able to follow many of the proofs had it not been for additional details provided in lecture. The preface is clear that this is intentional.

Finally, despite being a second edition, there are a fair number of typos, especially in the problems.

While there is always a trade-off between rigor and accessibility when writing a textbook, each of the above failings cause the book to be both less rigorous and less approachable, greatly increasing the frustration of trying to learn the material.

Bobby Norton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies","A beautiful, readable introduction to how information grows through computation and how it shapes society","César Hidalgo has written an important and ambitious book. His professional background in physics, network science, complex systems, and economics, as well as his personal experience in international travel, friendship, and fatherhood, gives him a unique perspective on the unifying theme across these diverse concerns: Information. ""Why Information Grows"" presents the relationship of energy, matter, and information in anecdotes, stories, and intuitive examples. Insights begin flowing right away: Like temperature and motion, information is incorporeal, but it is physical: Information is physical order, like the difference between a shuffled and sorted deck of cards.

This conversational approach allows the key concepts to emerge quickly and naturally. To briefly summarize the arguments:

The universe is made of energy, matter, and information. Information emerges spontaneously in out-of-equilibrium systems, like the swirls of milk in coffee. This information would be short-lived if not for the ability of solids to allow information to endure and be recombined with other information into more complex forms: Energy is needed for information to emerge, and solid matter is needed for information to endure. Information grows since matter can compute in an iterative process that uses the information embedded in solids to transform energy into different solids and new information.

Computation happens in plants or bacteria, but the human brain is the ultimate incarnation of the computational capacities of matter. We organize our brain and our society to beget new forms of information, deposited in objects and language. These allow us to distribution information, both knowhow and knowledge. What's the difference between the two? We know how to walk, but most of us don't know the biomechanics of how we walk. Some rare individuals know both, and can combine that information with robotics and prosthetics to build new creations like artificial limbs.

Humans have the unique ability to do what César poetically describes as ""crystallize information"". We create objects from our imagination and from the collective fiction we develop with others through expression and language. We eventually hit limits of what we can compute and manifest on our own, forcing us to work with others to form a distributed computer...a social network with an emergent collective intelligence. This human network leads to economies embedded in social and professional networks that predate and constrain economic activity.

The inequality of the wealth of nations is an inevitable consequence of the inequality of the distribution of large networks of knowledge and knowhow. César then leverages his previous in-depth work on economic complexity to make four important testable predictions:

• Simpler economic activities will be more ubiquitous.
• Diversified economies will be the only ones capable of executing complex economic activities
• Countries will diversify toward related products
• Over the long run (> five years), a region's level of income will approach the complexity of its economy, as approximated by product exports

Society is a collective computer, augmented by the products we produce to compute new forms of information. The social and economic problem that we are truly trying to solve is that of embodying knowledge and knowhow in networks of humans. This evolves the computational capacity of the human race, and ultimately helps information grow.

César certainly could have made this a highly mathematical treatise suitable for publication in Nature or the PNAS. Indeed, for the more technical reader, the book's 25 page appendix provides copious references that back up the author's claims. I enjoyed the behind-the-scenes insight into the works of figures that were new to me like Ilya Prigogine, Francis Fukuyama, and Wassily Leontief.

The book ends with a powerful moral imperative: ""We worry about money and taxes instead of owning the responsibility of perpetuating this godless creation: a creation that grew from modest physical principles and which has now been bestowed upon us."" César comes from and contributes to a community of thinkers and makers that learn from the past and live in the present from which a better future can emerge. By describing the importance of information from atoms to economies, he implicitly bids the reader to do the same. ""Our world is different from that of early hominids only in the way in which atoms are arranged"": Here's to ever-increasing information, our ability to work peacefully together in society to achieve it, and to the beautiful complexity that information and augmented computation brings.",79
Santiago Ortiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",This is a wonderful book. The way it introduces information and entropy ...,"This is a wonderful book. The way it introduces information and entropy is refreshing and clear. I don't think I ever read such an intuitive explanation of entropy, (at least a one that goes beyond entropy as disorder).

It also provides an interesting and new perspectives of what economy is, and how to measure it. More than just being an alternative approach it's quite complementary, and specially convenient for the times we live in which we have a lot of data about all the data we have.

Yes it's also a book about data,… and it doesn't mention ""Big Data"". Thanks for that César. It's also a book about technology and yet the word barely appears (César instead uses a very poetic name the reader will find beautiful and appropriate).

And yet the book has gaps (for those gaps I first 4★ed the book but then I thought contents were good enough and that I had a very pleasurable reading). And the gaps are not small:

One of the main concepts introduced in this book is that of economic complexity, an index that can be applied to regions, industries or companies. And yet the author doesn't give a definition of it (he gives a hint, enough to show that the index is difficult to define in bare words). Well, he could have used an appendix to provide a definition!

Then the author claims this index predicts future rates of growth (in conventional economic terms). Yes, it shows how that correlation exists between the economic complexity index measured for countries in 1985 and present rates of growth. Bu that's just one correlation, it's far from enough. Ok, he believes on his index,… thus the natural next thing to do is to show current values of economic complexity for countries, and thus give us a prediction of future economic growth (and with that, an option of testing the prediction). Mysteriously enough the author doesn't provide that information either.

(Note the negative synergy of the lack of a formal definition of the index, and the lack of the current data… specially when claimed that the index predicts our future).

Finally, I felt there's also a gap between the first part, in which he introduces information and entropy, and how both are in essence physical (solid) phenomena and not just mathematical, and also how matter computes; and the second part in which he jumps to a bigger scale, that of societies. It's somehow difficult to understand how both parts connect. At the end of the book he gives a very good summary, which certainly helps establishing the connection. Strangely enough, it's actually outside the main body of the text, in the acknowledgments (yes I read them, they actually have interesting ideas and stories), in which César more clearly manifests the link:

""As I […] tried to escape the rhetorics of deprivation, guilt, prosperity, optimization, equilibrium, and wealth, I learned that economic growth was nothing more than an epiphenomenon of a larger, more universal, and more relevant phenomenon. This is not the growth that captures headlines and political agendas, but the growth that makes possible the existence of life and society— even if we ignore it. This is the growth of physical order, or information. Soon I had to accept that information was what it was all about. At this point, I could no longer see the economy in terms of income, regulations, and agents. The economy was a mundane manifestation of something deeper.""

Gaps or no gaps, I thoroughly recommend this book.",45
Jorge Alonso,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",Great Essay,"I began the reading of this book with much skepticism, as I consider myself an orthodox economist. However, I enjoyed every page of it.
The author describes the basic principles of how information grows, at any level, to transcend to humans - a species particularly able to create and store information.
Next, the author provides compelling arguments on how information and its complexity is what lies behind old fashioned aggregate factors of growth and development (physical and human capital). In this new approach to growth, the most developed of societies will be those able to support largest, and more complex, networks of persons and firms to support the manufacturing of a manifold of products.
A very pleasant reading for everybody as it does not require any specialized knowledge",8
Eduardo Gomien,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",To any economist trying to escape,"This book is a piece of jewelry. I studied economics, so the first part concerning physics (Bits and Atoms) was a little difficult for me -and for any uninitiated, I believe-. But as soon as I understood the theoretical framework that Hidalgo built on the first three chapters, and read the rest of the book at the light of those principles the effort was soon enough rewarded.

Part III and IV of the book (""The Quantization of Knowhow"" and ""The Complexity of the Economy"", respectively) were the most bewitching and absorbing ones for me. A lot of economic notions and models are defied there, and new economic conceptions arise.

Why Information Grows is a major contribution to any economist trying to escape from the traditional paradigms of the discipline. This amazing book will help you to create new synapsis, connecting fascinating disciplines and ideas once separated in your mind. Then, armed with a new toolkit of concepts -the crystallization of imagination, a new theory of ‘exploitation’, the personbyte and firmbyte theory, etc.-, you’ll be able to start thinking in innovative ways some proposals to improve the dismal science and -why not-, the future of our world.",3
Andrew White,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",Eminently readable and enjoyable exploration for what can be a dry topic.,"What a delightful book. I plundered its treasures in just two weekends. Mr. Hidalgo takes us on a journey to look at and explore what information is. We start by exploring the principles of information, knowledge and knowhow. We start by looking at how everything, from your shoes to my teeth to the Federal Government are made up of ordered things. Some are more ordered than 'normal' and that's where we, and information, come in. When in its natural equilibrium or disordered state there is little information. When out of equilibrium, order emerges such that rich information can be observed and this is where people come in since we create a lot of 'out of equilibrium' stuff We expand our horizons and fascinatingly and simply prove that time travel is impossible. Just watch out for all those ping pong balls! We move beyond the conceptual ideas of information as ordered things to look at knowledge and knowhow, and specifically how people group together. We then look at the ideas applied to firms, the economy, then society. The earlier part of the book, creating the building blocks of his core ideas, are very interesting. I am intrigued at the potential of his ideas in reevaluating the boundaries of firms and supply chains. But his arguments seem to reach a little far when he pushes these ideas to explain how economies grow. His argument fits the observed data, mostly, he says but that's not the point. He does not pontificate or apply his ideas looking forward in time. I'd like to hear how his ideas predict what the Internet will do to the boundaries of the firm, and how economies are going to change going forward. He does none of this. Ignoring the niggling gaps I am still left with a thought provoking, eminently readable treasure that is fun to read that also gives me a new refreshing lens to rethink how we work. Well recommended 9 out of 10.",2
Mike Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",A foundational text for future interdisciplinary network studies,"This is an ambitious, profound, albeit imperfect work, much deserving of a wide audience. I have followed Hidalgo for some time and very few are equal to his ability to clearly express the objective power latent in network models. The book is an extension/elaboration of the 2007 work on a world network space of products and is no less profound in its implications.

The topic is unapologetically vast, yet I wish several threads of argument would have been explored to augment what was chosen for publication. These include spatial approaches to information exchange social sciences outside of economics (geographical ecology, cultural evolution, urban sociology, social pych. ect.)",2
Rudy Godoy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",I'm still processing all the ideas from the excellent work that Cesar has put together,"I'm still processing all the ideas from the excellent work that Cesar has put together. I'd encourage anyone interested in economic development, business development and even social development to buy it.
Ideas shared in the book link different topics and aspects that few people managed to get them related one another to explain the crucial concept: why some countries develop more than others? That's one of the key contributions of Cesar. The other is the sort of conclusion, because at least for me it's not a book that ends with a conclusion but an eye opening for future thought; that was identified as one of the elements that can answer the previous question.
Enjoy!",1
SRenan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",Re-defining information as a fundamental force driving our evolution,"WHY INFORMATION GROWS is not what I expected -- which was more insight on ""the new science of networks"". Instead it was about defining information itself -- what generates it and what it generates. The book further challenged me to rethink how the collective intelligence of things, people, and systems might actually work. So this is NOT a page-turner, because it keeps making you stop to think.

For me, the bottom line is that Cesar A. Hidalgo is a deep thinker with a unique intelligence -- further turbo-charged (I assume) by his work with Albert-Laszlo Barabasi at Notre Dame. Like Barabasi, he is capable of finding fresh ways to look across multiple heterogenous domains in order to show us the big picture in a bigger way. Thus anything Hidalgo generates demands serious consideration. And that includes WHY INFORMATION GROWS. I only surfed the book the first time but expect to return for a deeper dive soon.",12

Aurelian Dochia,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",A new and refreshing perspective,"A book that falls short of its ambition, just because its ambition is so high! The author tries to find an overarching process that could explain the whole evolution of the Universe, from the Big Bang to human societies. He thinks that the accumulation of information in increasingly complex structures is what drives the world and compensates for entropic degradation. This Hegelian grand vision is not very well supported by the text: it builds high expectations in the first part, to finish, probably inevitably, in some frustration because of many loose ends, confusing concepts and unconvincing arguments. However, my frustration is more like a lover's frustration who expects nothing less than perfection...
No doubt the author is on something important, his book sheds light on dimensions usually neglected by the economic discourse and cleverly brings together and makes sense of topics that otherwise hardly find a place in economists' current worldview. This book is an opening, not a conclusion.",6
MikeBinChatt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies","and Hidalgo ""was embarrassed about not knowing Prigogine's work"" so he ""rushed to the Web and bought many of his wonderful books","This is what I wrote to a professor I work with about this work a few minutes ago. in preface, I began an obsession with the implications of Ilya Prigogine's work in the early 1990s while studying at Georgetown. I have used his books to push my self-directed learning over the intervening quarter century. In the last couple years, I've begun applying these concepts to entrepreneurial ecosystems, one of which I live among in Chattanooga, TN. I moved to TN from Boston, which is coincidentally where Hidalgo lives and works at MIT. Now the email to my collaborator, a social entrepreneurship professor from UT Austin, now living and working in Chattanooga at UTC.
_____________________________________________________

So, I had Why Information Grows waiting for me when I got home Wednesday night (from an economics conference in San Diego). I began reading it Thursday evening and finished it this morning. Chapter 3 is the single most cogent presentation of self-organisation I have ever seen. I don't know if it's because of the hundreds of hours I've spent reading Prigogine and another hundreds of hours reading texts to allow me to make some progress in re-reading Prigogine that caused such a huge impact, but it has charged me up tremendously.

It is humbling on the one hand, and extremely gratifying on the other: In his acknowledgements, Hidalgo described flailing in the writing of the core concept driving the book's thesis, how information grows from physical processes. A student of his at MIT, Francisco Humeres, introduced Hidalgo to Ilya Prigogine's concepts, and Hidalgo ""was embarrassed about not knowing Prigogine's work"" so he ""rushed to the Web and bought many of his wonderful books"" and dedicated a month to reading and writing ""what is now Chapter 3."" (p187)

It's humbling because this MIT professor spent a month with Prigogine's work after a conversation with an urban planner student. And he came up with what he came up with, which is astonishingly simple and true. He explained in a few pages what I've been trying to articulate for years. I don't think I could have understood what he wrote with a fullness that brought me true intellectual joy if I hadn't spent that time with the texts. But I did, and I have the payoff. It's humbling to come by it this way though, where I did not grasp the implications of certain formula and descriptive text to get what Hidalgo gave me.

What is truly gratifying, however, is that Prigogine's work is being propagated by the best and brightest among us into the next generation, among which I count you yourself. As you know, I've been worried about his breath-taking work on the emergence of the new form of matter involving large numbers of particles in out-of-equilibrium open systems. Hidalgo not only nails this, but then connects it to economics, both neo-classical and institutionalists. He doesn't mention evolutionary economics by name, but he has clearly taken that by-road. I will check to see if he read Dopfer's 2005 collection of essays, but I suspect he has, at a depth inaccessible to me.

You, as an economic academic, will unquestionably question his theorizing about learning and networks, but it is provocative and simple. It blew my mind. And it helped me with my own analogizing immensely. I can't wait to discuss this book with you.",5
Carsten Schmidt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",One of the most interesting reads of the year.,"Amazing book.

A.S.H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",Connecting the Dots,"A compelling treatment on the age-old scientific quandary: In a universe that is continuously diffusing in energy and matter, how are life and societies able to grow increasingly more complex against this overwhelming gradient. Additionally, it serves as a perfect primer for those interested in Network Theory, Network Science, Complexity and of course Information. A swift read that entertains as much as it opens doors into these topics.

Most importantly the ideas conveyed throughout the book are explained in an accessible fashion using metaphors to paint mental pictures anyone can see. A worthy example of pedagogy through anecdotes, interesting and open. For example, there is an early section devoted to the concept of Entropy, seen both through the eyes of Boltzmann and Shannon, the Chemistry and Information Theory giants; instead of the traditional molecules in a container model, Hidalgo uses seating arrangements in a stadium. I won’t ruin it through paraphrase but these types of distinctions alone were worth the price of admission for me. I would’ve preferred a slightly deeper dive into the mathematical principles but it goes a long way toward bringing together some underpinning doctrines of physics and chemistry into sociology, anthropology and most importantly economics.

It is both incredibly dense in content and mind expanding enough you’ll be tempted to tear a few pages out, roll them up and light them. I’d recommend this reading for those interested in the history and science of a major duality of our condition and one that provides context into topics that touch so many others in an entertaining and jovial way.",4

As such, I don't have any problem with the author's bold, sometimes tenuously qualitative attempts to weave together a unified theory of everything argument. I think he tells a wonderful story, even if it is only supported enough at this point to be called a story rather than a QED theory. Sometimes the value of a piece of music is not in the story that the music tells, but in the places that the listener's imagination can drift while the music is playing. Such is the case here. Don't worry that the author has not QED proved his ""atoms to economies"" theories.

A. Menon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",Highly readable introduction to the nature of knowledge and knowhow,"Why Information Grows is an engaging look about how information is encoded by society and how it grows and is transmitted. The author balances economics and physics to build a narrative about the network dynamics required to successfully grow our ability to process information. In a clear and concise manner the author starts with discussing how information is encoded, how ideas and knowledge can transform relatively useless matter to usable technology, how information is finite at the individual level and how networks are needed for information to be able to grow after a certain point and finally on what all this means for economic complexity.

Why information grows is split into essentially 4 parts. The author first talks about how much the world has changed since our species first started colonizing the planet despite our biology remaining constant. By framing the progress achieved in the modern world as a consequence of non-biological adaptation the importance of how information grows becomes obvious. The author then goes on to discuss the value of matter and how an antique car's value is not due to its commodity intensity but rather its unique construction and heritage which embody information. The author also discusses thermodynamics and how biology and our ecosystem seem to be able to go against the tide by being able to process information. The author then moves on to how our knowledge and knowhow can transform mental information into physical utility and how companies like apple are due to the intellectual property that transforms matter to our benefit. The author highlights the ability for manufacturing technology to take things from the realm of ideas to the physical world. The author then moves on to the fact that individuals can only know so much. Though the capacity of people clearly varies it is useful to recognize the limit of individuals as it frames the question of what is required to build complex products that require the knowledge of many. The author starts to discuss the networks of people and structure of networks required for successful collaborative projects. The author discusses the different networks that define countries like the US and commodity exporters. There are some illuminating graphs of the input output structures over time of different countries that help the reader visualize the authors ideas. The author then goes on to discuss the relationship between economic complexity and growth and infers that complexity relative to per capita income is a reasonable indication of economic growth potential.

Why Information Grows gives a good perspective of the combinatorial nature of information and how new ideas are formed. In describing knowledge and knowhow the author conveys the ingredients that go in to innovation and product development that are usually assumed in textbooks. Very readable and intuitive, why information grows is an enjoyable introduction to how complexity is managed within the modern economy.",1

Joe Rebholz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",An excellent idea --- explain Social Capital in terms of the evolution of information --- but it needs work.,"I hesitate to call the following a review but I will comment on some aspects of the book, namely those having to do with information. I found myself highlighting and writing notes to attempt to understand what the author meant by ideas such as physical order and information are the same, the universe can compute, why solids are special for containing information, why the distinction between knowledge and knowhow (since they are both information), the distinction between individual capital and social capital (since these are really not separable), etc. It seems to me that these problems with the book are due to the fact that there is no standard definition of information and what the author uses to characterize information contains some truth but that it all needs to be worked out more carefully.

I had intended to elaborate each of my notes but since most of these notes were trying to clarify the author’s ideas for me in terms of information I will just give my definition of information. See below. Then the author or you, the reader, can use it to better understand what the author is saying. This definition does not depend on any mathematics, it doesn’t refer to Boltzmann or Shannon. It applies to the information in or processed by computers, the information in human and other animal brains/bodies, and life in general, the information in all our artifacts, the information in all our institutions and organizations, and the information in nature.

Here’s one confusing quote:

“That something, which fascinates you and me as much as it did Boltzmann, is physical order or information.” ---- Hidalgo, Cesar (2015-06-02). Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies (Kindle Locations 236-237). Basic Books. Kindle Edition. Here Cesar Hidalgo clearly equates information and physical order. They are not the same. This confusion messes up the title too. The book is (trying to be) about the evolution of information.

Although A.J. Sutter has already pointed out that Cesar Hidalgo uses 'information' and 'physical order' to mean the same thing throughout his book and that they are not the same, I suggest the author could eliminate almost all confusion regarding information if he would apply the definition I suggest consistently throughout his book because his book has great value in so far as it can link information and the growth of information, etc. to the economic concepts of human capital and social capital. Maybe he could get one or more of his students to do the grunge work. It wouldn’t be the first time students do a lot of the work.

Information is much more than physical order. It is not a physical thing but it is inseparable from matter/energy. Some people question whether information exists. We use the word but I’ve never seen a definition except in a dictionary. Most books about information don’t give a definition of information. They may give a few examples and then they get mathematical.

OK, then what is information?

Let’s start with a dictionary definition of information. This is from Merriam-webster.com.

Main Entry: in•for•ma•tion
Pronunciation: \ˌin-fər-ˈmā-shən\
Function: noun
Date: 14th century
1 : the communication or reception of knowledge or intelligence
2 a (1) : knowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction (2) : intelligence, news (3) : facts, data b : the attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more alternative sequences or arrangements of something (as nucleotides in DNA or binary digits in a computer program) that produce specific effects c (1) : a signal or character (as in a communication system or computer) representing data (2) : something (as a message, experimental data, or a picture) which justifies change in a construct (as a plan or theory) that represents physical or mental experience or another construct d : a quantitative measure of the content of information; specifically : a numerical quantity that measures the uncertainty in the outcome of an experiment to be performed
3 : the act of informing against a person
4 : a formal accusation of a crime made by a prosecuting officer as distinguished from an indictment presented by a grand jury

2b is what we want. Let’s see if we can make sense of it:
The attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more alternative sequences or arrangements of something (as nucleotides in DNA or binary digits in a computer program) that produce specific effects.
So, we must first of all have:
“one of two or more alternative sequences or arrangements of something”
Consider a traffic signal. A simple traffic signal as seen by a driver approaching an intersection has three lights. Only one light is on at any time. On the top is a red light, on the bottom is a green light, and in the middle is a yellow light. If the green light is on it means the driver can continue driving through the intersection if the intersection is clear. If the red light is on it means the driver must stop the vehicle. If the yellow light is on it means the red light is about to come on and the driver should stop the vehicle if it is possible to do so before it gets into the intersection.
So there are three alternative arrangements of the traffic signal: 1) The green light is on; 2) The red light is on; 3) The yellow light is on. They are alternative arrangements of the traffic signal since any one light could be on but no more than one at any one time. At any instant the driver will see only one of the three alternative arrangements of the traffic signal. And the driver is expected to do different things depending on the color of the light seen. The different colors of the light produce the “specific effects”.
The definition of information as applied to this traffic signal says the information is:
The attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more alternative sequences or arrangements of something that produce specific effects.
So what is the attribute inherent in and communicated by one of the three alternative arrangements of the traffic signal? It is the color of the light that’s on at any given instant, either green, red, or yellow.
This definition of information says that information is the attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more alternative sequences or arrangements of something … What are some other attributes of something? We just saw that color is an attribute. Other attributes of a physical thing are weight, size, shape, texture, loudness, frequency of sound or light, in general physical qualities of various things, matter and energy, that are measurable, observable, perceivable, etc.
What does it mean to say something is inherent in something? It just means it is essential to that something as sweetness is inherent in sugar. This is why we say that information is in or on something, as information is in a book, on a computer disk, in your body, or in your brain or on the internet. Whatever the information is in or on we call the substrate of that information.
What is this “communicated by”? What does this mean? What is it telling us? In the case of the traffic signal we can say the attribute inherent in and communicated by the traffic signal is the color of the light which is on at a specific instant. Communicating is more than emitting. It takes two to communicate. For communication to occur there must be a receiver, a someone or something to receive, perceive, or otherwise react to the color of the light which the traffic signal is sending out. In our example it was a person driving a vehicle.
To communicate is to transfer information. So something created the information (made a pattern of matter/energy) and something (else) reads it or perceives it and uses it; that something (else) interprets the information and makes the decision, the choice(s) inherent in the information. The something (else) sees an alternative and does or causes the specific effect associated with the alternative seen. How does it do this? A human already has information in its brain/body that he or she matches with the alternative seen, the external pattern of matter/energy. The receiver then does whatever it has associated with the alternative.
This connects with the phrase “… that produce specific effects”. The color is communicated to the driver and produces specific effects in her or him. In particular there are three separate behavior patterns that were embodied in the driver’s brain/body long ago one of which will be triggered depending on which of the three colors she or he sees. So green produces one behavior, red produces another behavior, and yellow a third behavior.
So information is not just alternative arrangements of matter/energy on some substrate. Someone or something must do something with it or be able to do something with it. By the above definition of information, information must be communicated to someone or something.
We have not yet talked about the word “sequence” in the definition. A sequence is a particular kind of arrangement, so it’s not really needed in the definition and we could leave it out. But a sequence is a nice kind of arrangement. The things in a sequence are ordered. In a sequence there is a first thing, a second thing, and maybe a third, a fourth, and so on. For example a word is a sequence of letters. A sentence is a sequence of words and punctuation marks. Most discussions of the information processed by computers end up talking about binary numbers, such as 0100101111 and 11001. These are sequences of zeros and ones. This happens because the information processed by ordinary computers is or can be coded as binary numbers. We want information processed by computers to be included in any definition of information we consider, but our main emphasis is to understand information as it relates to human interactions, human communication and behavior. Below we can leave out “sequences” as long as we keep in mind that a sequence is a particular kind of arrangement.
We have said that the “something” that is arranged means something in the physical world, matter and/or energy, and that we don’t need the word “sequence” since a sequence is just a particular kind of arrangement. Then we rephrase the definition as:
The attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more alternative arrangements of matter/energy that produce specific effects.
Now what’s the effect of the word “alternative”? It is to say that any of the arrangements could be used and the arrangements must be different and distinguishable by someone or something. How do we make sense of the phrase:
“that produce specific effects”
How can different arrangements of matter/energy produce specific effects? The definition doesn’t say. The phrase “communicated by” implies there must be something or someone which looks at, or manipulates or otherwise perceives or interacts with the alternative arrangements of the matter/energy and do different things (produce specific effects) depending on which particular arrangement is present at the time of the looking, etc.
Could an arrangement of matter/energy by itself produce specific effects? Yes. Atoms and molecules move around, combine, break apart, and in general interact with each other. A system of atoms could be in multiple different arrangements, and such a system, operating according to the laws of physics and chemistry, will do various things, and produce specific effects, in the future, depending on its particular arrangement now.
Since someone is something, we can drop “someone” to simplify the definition further. So each arrangement itself, or something else, must produce specific effects. So something must be able to do different things depending on the specific arrangements that occur. So the arrangements must be distinguishable by whomever or whatever acts on them, because if two arrangements were indistinguishable by whomever or whatever acts on the possible arrangements, the actor couldn’t do possibly different things depending on which arrangement the actor saw. If you are color blind and cannot see the difference between the colors red and green, then you cannot use color to determine whether you should stop or go at a traffic signal. So for you the color of the light is not information for you since you can’t use it; you can’t distinguish the red color from the green color. Red/green color blind people can use other information such as the fact that the red stop light is above the green go light.
So we could add the word “distinguishable” but we don’t have to since distinguishability is implied by the actions someone or something must be able to take. So we have:
Information is the attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more (distinguishable) arrangements of matter/energy that something uses to produce specific effects corresponding to the specific arrangement detected.
Notice that two distinguishable arrangements could produce the same specific effect.
Here’s another way to say it:
Information is the attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more (distinguishable) arrangements of matter/energy such that if the arrangement is one way one thing is done, and if the arrangement is another way a possibly different thing is done, and so on. And there must be someone or something which distinguishes between the arrangements and acts accordingly.
Notice that the above discussion about distinguishable arrangements and whether or not different arrangements could produce the same effects amount to questions about the associations between the arrangements and the specific effects. An association relates members of one collection to members of another collection. For example a collection of arrangements and a collection of specific effects. The simplest association is called a one to one correspondence: For each arrangement there is exactly one effect corresponding to it such that that arrangement produces that effect, and for every effect there is exactly one arrangement that produces that effect.
Associations don’t have to be one-to-one. There can be many-to-one associations. Suppose somehow a person who has never seen nor heard of traffic signals and knows absolutely nothing about them is driving a car and comes to an intersection with a traffic signal. This naïve driver would likely do the same thing --- keep on driving --- whether the light is green, red, or yellow. So this would be a many-to-one association in this driver. He can distinguish the three colors green, red, and yellow, but he does the same thing --- keeps on driving --- whatever color he sees. There can be one-to-many associations also. For example a single word might have multiple meanings.
The association between different arrangements of matter/energy and their effects can be a one-to-one correspondence or there can be situations where different distinguishable arrangements have the same effect as with the naïve driver. Also see the discussion below of DNA.
There are situations where arrangements might be distinguishable by one actor but not by another. As mentioned above some people are color blind to various degrees. So for arrangements of matter that depended on different colors to be distinguishable, some people might see two arrangements as different whereas others see them as the same. So information depends on the user of it.
If the different arrangements themselves produce specific effects, then what is the something which produces the specific effects? It is a physical system in which the different arrangements of matter/energy are possible, and in which if one of the arrangements occurred, then that arrangement’s effect would occur.
What about the distinction between the agent acting on the information versus being able to act on it? Must information be acted upon to be information? It’s the ability that counts. Consider some book in a bookcase that I will most likely never read again and that most likely no one will ever read again. Would we say there is no information in that book? No, because I could read it or I might read it or someone else might read it.
We might say that for a person information is a rule they apply: If arrangement 1 is present, then do action 1; if arrangement 2 is present, then do action 2; if arrangement 3 is present, then do action 3, and so on.

This definition is from my book Information, Communication, Cooperation: The Force of Human Progress. It’s available on Amazon as a digital or paper book.

A. J. Sutter,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies","A problem-rich whirlpool, unfortunately (2.5 stars)","This is a very ambitious book that unfortunately is marred by some significant flaws. Its goal is to unite economics with biology and physics, through the common thread of information theory. But along the way it makes some excessive claims, particularly about ""order"" and humanity's uniqueness in the cosmos, that undermine the logical coherence of the argument. The author (CH) also adopts an unusually narrow definition of an economy, excluding not only production of goods for domestic consumption but the entire services sector, even though the latter accounts the majority of GDP in most developed countries. The book also presents a graph that seems to conflate exchange rate differences with economic growth (unlike the peer-reviewed paper on which it's based); see the discussion of my correspondence with CH on this point in 2(c) below. Finally, and most disturbingly, while celebrating the production of ever more complex physical products as the fulfilment of a natural law of the universe, the book is entirely oblivious to the environmental impact of making so much stuff -- a reckless omission for a book about physics and economics written in the early 21st Century.

In the long review that follows, I'll first discuss some problems relating to the discussion of physics and information theory (section 1), then focus on some issues relating to economics (section 2), before discussing the book's synthesis of these topics (section 3) and concluding with some observations about style (section 4).

1. PHYSICS ISSUES

The book opens with a dramatic discussion of how Ludwig Boltzmann's formula for the statistical mechanical (SM) entropy is ""identical"" to Claude Shannon's formula for the information theory (IT) entropy of encoding a message (@xvii, 14). Shannon, CH says, equated ""information"" with ""entropy"" (@17). CH overlooks that Shannon called the same expression the ""uncertainty"" when it comes to *decoding* the message -- our usual position vis-à-vis the information content of nature's messages. This notion of ""uncertainty"" leads many writers to compare the IT entropy to *missing* information (e.g., physicist Arieh Ben-Naim, who wants to ditch the word 'entropy' altogether).

More common, though, is to confuse entropy with ""disorder."" CH correctly points out that error (@17), but while doing so seems to have fallen into a new one. Throughout the book, he uses 'information' and 'physical order' to mean the same thing, often using both in apposition within the same sentence (e.g., @ix, xiv, xx, 5, 7, 8, 12, 18, 19, 23, 24, 184, 196, to name a few). Noting a ""tradition"" among ""the general public"" of ""equating information with something more than bits"" (@18), he seems to reason as follows: disorder ~ SM entropy ~ IT entropy ~ _missing_ information => information ~ physical order.

I've checked stacks of books and articles, but so far I've yet to find another physicist who endorses this correspondence. The presence of 'order' is very context-dependent. Consider a 1024x1024 screen with about half black pixels and half white pixels. Suppose it's organized into 4 stripes of even width and alternating color: that's highly ordered, with low IT entropy. Now suppose it looks more like the ""snow"" on a TV screen -- but suppose I've painstakingly encoded a message into the million pixels, one at a time. In that case, it's highly ordered, with high IT entropy. Finally, suppose I based it on a snapshot of a particular instant of real TV screen snow: in that case, the pattern is random, i.e. *disordered,* with high IT entropy. Maybe you could distinguish the ordered, message version from the random version using a tool called ""mutual information"" (never discussed by CH), but the point is: order can have high or low IT entropy, and high IT entropy can be associated with both order and disorder. Regardless of whether you use Shannon's or CH's interpretation of ""information,"" there isn't a monotonic association between information and order. (Although he is focused on the meaning of ""complexity,"" Peter Grassberger makes a similar point in discussing Fig. 3 of his 2012 paper, ""Randomness Information Complexity,"" on the arXiv.) Moreover, many physicists regard new information as coming from such events as quantum fluctuations and quantum decoherence -- events that seem to me to be more in the ""disorder"" camp; see, e.g., the article by Seth Lloyd in ""Complexity and the Arrow of Time"" (Cambridge UP 2013). CH never mentions either of these types of event.

CH invokes Nobel laureate Ilya Prigogine as the inspiration for several claims, among them: (I) ""[I]nformation emerges naturally in the steady states of physical systems that are out of equilibrium"" (@28), (II) the whirlpool that forms over your bathtub is drain is an ""information-rich state ...that we get for free in an out-of-equilibrium system"" (@29), and (III) ""[T]here is no past, and no future, but only a present that is being calculated at every instant,"" a view CH calls the ""instantaneous universe of Prigogine"" (@40). Prigogine is a divisive figure among physicists, and also among the broader community of researchers studying complexity; but as a dilettante in that field I'm probably more sympathetic to his views than not. Unfortunately, despite my good will, when I looked through four books by Prigogine I found evidence only for statement (I). The closest I found regarding (III) appeared to be a *rejection* of Henri Bergson's ""instantaneous"" view of time (Prigogine & Stengers @92). Regarding (II), CH claims ""information-rich"" refers to states with ""correlations that give 'information' its usual meaning"" (@18), though in (II) CH evidently means the same sort of information as used in (I). I consulted with a nanotech theoretical physicist who had recently published a paper with ""information-rich"" in the title, who suggested its use in the bathtub context arose from a confusion about information and entropy. Cf. Cross & Greenside's textbook on non-equilibrium pattern formation (CUP 2009), which doesn't invoke information at all; ditto for the Sinha & Sridhar text on patterns in excitable media (CRC 2015). Still, for the sake of argument, I'm content to give CH the benefit of the doubt on this, but since statements (I) and (II) play a prominent role in his synthesis, I postpone further discussion of them until Section 3.

2. ECONOMICS ISSUES

a. What is the economy?:

CH's characterization of the economy is limited to the conception and production of solid objects. His discussion of ""economic complexity"" is further restricted to sales of such objects (and their physical inputs) in market transactions in international trade (e.g. @154-155). To say that's a limited view of the economy is an understatement. It excludes services, which have accounted for >50% of the GDP of the US since the 1950s and of Japan since the 1960s, to mention but two examples. It excludes domestic production of goods, which may incorporate considerable knowledge and knowhow. For example, Japan has the world's largest number of companies over 100 and 1,000 years old. Many of these are providers of local goods and services, such as foodstuffs like yuzumiso, products like the nose cones for Japan's bullet trains (which are shaped *by hand*), and services such as repairing ancient religious architecture; the skill required for each of these is tremendous.

There are many types of knowledge and knowhow that aren't involved in market transactions, too. But while the book's long discussion of ""social capital"" (Ch. 8) veers close to that topic, it focuses resolutely on economic impact. This myopia leads an expression of surprise at discovering society: ""Yet there are also good reasons to believe that social networks predate modern economic activity. ... As [a] team of researchers puts it, 'Certain elements of social network structure may have been present in an early point in human history' -- a point that, of course, might be earlier than the emergence of modern markets"" (@117). Boy, had I been messed up: I'd thought it was small bands of intrepid bond traders who were the first to kill wooly mammoths for food and protect their families from hungry sabre-tooths.

I stray, though, in mentioning bond traders, because in this book's view the financial services industry doesn't exist. And anyway, there isn't any need to worry about those members of the 1%, because they aren't actually rich: ""Our ability to crystallize imagination teaches us an important lesson about the complexity of economies: markets do not make us richer but *wiser* , since they produce wealth as long as they give us indirect access to the practical uses of the knowledge and imagination that our species has been able to accumulate"" (@69, emphasis in original)."" How broad is the meaning of ""indirect""? Broad enough to take in short trading, front running, and outright market manipulation?

And is *producing* wealth all that markets do? Might they not have a role in *transferring* it, e.g. via what the classical economists called rents? Whether it's because of his own ideological commitment or simply because he's too focused on his field of research, CH's narrative effectively masks not only most of the economy but the economy's impact on society, and risks turning the book into a sketch for a neoliberal Theory of Everything.

b. Aggregates and advantages:

Turning to more technical issues, CH does make a worthwhile point in championing disaggregation of types of production, updating the work of Wassily Leontief by using network and graph theoretical techniques. That aspect of his work seems both interesting and solid. Nonetheless, he swallows whole the notion of using production functions, never so much as mentioning the critique of them by Piero Sraffa et al. in the ""Cambridge controversy"" between U. Cambridge economists and MIT economists (a controversy that MIT economist Robert Solow, having outlived his antagonists, has for decades simply asserted that he won).

It's ironic, though, that CH offers us long and very reasonable endnote (@200n12) deriding the circularity of ""revealed preferences"" -- the neoclassical notion, developed by MIT economist Paul Samuelson, that the fact that we buy something means that we really wanted to buy it. He omits to mention that his own published research relies on something called ""revealed comparative advantage,"" a term that suggests that because a country sells a disproportionately bigger amount of a product than other countries it's got some Ricardian advantage in selling it. In the real world, there can be many reasons why we buy stuff from one country and not another -- oil from the Saudis and not from Iran, Cold War era goods from Japan and not from the Soviets -- that don't have anything to do with quality, productivity, etc. Similarly, despite the fact that the data he presents seems to start in the 1980s, CH never once reflects on whether peculiar institutional conditions promoting international trade since that decade -- e.g., WTO, the IMF, the World Bank, etc. -- might render his results to be less representative of a force of nature and more representative of a particular socially- and politically-constructed form of capitalism in our present era.

c. Predictive accuracy of ""economic complexity"" metric:

In Figure 15 (@160), CH presents evidence that the metric of ""economic complexity"" he published in 2009 with Ricardo Hausmann (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 106:10570-10575, available online for free, along with supporting material) predicts future economic growth accurately, albeit on time scales of ' 5 years. The graph shows a scatterplot of annualised GDP per capita growth rates for various countries from 1985 to 2000 (i.e., the calculated annual rate that would take you from GDP per capita in 1985 to GDP per capita in 2000), with the X-axis values being the rate predicted by CH's metrics and the Y-axis being the observed rates.

Look at the book's graph and you'll immediately see something striking: there are about 15 countries where the supposedly observed annualized rate was above 8%, and in some cases above 10%. Reality check: 8% annual growth of GDPPC for 15 years would more than *triple* it, and a 10% rate would more than *quadruple* it. One of these supposed super-growers is Japan, which for most of that historical period was famously experiencing its low-growth ""Lost Decade,"" so this data struck me as downright bizarre.

I followed a link from the American Economics Association and checked the Conference Board's Total Economy Database. Using PPP (purchasing power parity) GDP per capita data, I computed the annualized endpoint-to-endpoint rates over that interval for the 15 countries involved. Here's what I got: Chile 4.98%, China 5.56%, Dominican Republic 3.29%, Hong Kong 3.54X, Ireland 5.75%, Israel 2.60%X, Jamaica 1.28%X, Japan 1.95%X, Korea 6.70%, Portugal 3.45%X, Singapore 4.66%, Spain 3.25%X, Turkey 2.51%X, United Kingdom 2.40%X, Uruguay 2.74%X. *All* of these are way less than the 8% to 10+% alleged to have been observed, and those marked with an X -- 9 out of the 15 -- are also *way* less than the predictions of CH's model as presented in the book. (Fig. 15 shows Japan's predicted growth at around 8%, too.)

Then I looked at the 2009 PNAS paper, which also uses PPP data. Figure 3F presents a test of the complexity metric for the interval 1985-2005 -- but only one country has an observed GDP per capita annualized growth of over 8%, China. Another outlier was Korea at just under 6%; Japan is lost in a crowd of type just below the break-even line, but its predicted growth looks to have been between 2%-3%. All in all, this graph looked pretty good, and consistent with my own sample of PPP-based calculations.

Thinking CH had made an unintended error by swapping in the wrong graph, I wrote to him to alert him to that. He kindly replied promptly, but defended the book's graph, explaining he had changed the data set subsequent to the 2009 peer-reviewed paper. His new source was ... Google, which uses current dollar value statistics from the World Bank World Development Indicators. He explained that ""[t]his time series has much better coverage (it includes more countries for more years) so I chose to use that."" (I've modified this review to correct my prior misunderstanding about a possible inadvertent substitution of the graph.)

When I checked Google, sure enough I found 7.24% annualized Japanese growth from 1985-2000. Since Google is always right, I might have ended my inquiries there, but I decided to check Japanese government statistics anyway. I couldn't find inflation-corrected figures for the entire time interval, but using official GDP and population statistics, I arrived at 2.77% annualized growth in nominal GDP per capita from 1985-2000, and 2.31% for inflation-corrected GDP per capita from 1985-1998 (Google gave the mind-boggling result of 7.94% for that period). The government growth rates are slightly higher than the PPP-based rates (which are intended for international comparison), but still quite close.

Digging deeper, the reason for the discrepancy appears to be simple: the yen-dollar exchange rate (XR). ""Current dollar"" values reflect XRs in effect at the time of the relevant data point; as this swings from year to year, GDP per capita expressed in this way will also be affected. If we use Japanese government data for population and nominal GDP, along with the annual average of the Federal Reserve daily XRs, we get results (4th Column) pretty close to Google/WB:

YEAR---JPN-NOMGDPPC-------FRB ¥/$----------RESULT-------WB (Book)----""Back Translation""
1985......¥2,672,822............238.471.........$11,208.16.......$11,465.73......¥2,734,244
1998......¥3,924,471............130.818.........$29,999.47.......$30,969.74......¥4,051,302
2000......¥4,029,610............107.821.........$37,373.15.......$32,716.42......¥3,527,517

Notice how the XR difference between 1985 and 2000 means Google/WB's GDP per capita figure almost triples, while the government's doesn't even double. That XR difference works out to *an annualized rate of more than 5%,* meaning that most of the purported Japanese ""economic growth"" shown in this book's Fig. 15 actually is due to exchange rates. WB apparently didn't use FRB XR data, so I can't be more precise. For the same reason, we can only get a very rough idea if we use the FRB data to ""back-translate"" the Google/WB data into yen. But doing so yields annualized growth rates in the 1.7%-3% range -- in the ballpark for the rates from the Japanese government, my PPP results, and the PNAS 2009 graph. It seems to me that Fig. 15 simply forgot to factor out exchange rates at each data point. (Actually, this would be hard for so many currencies -- a good reason to avoid constant-dollar stats.) If I'm right about that, then a good way to avoid this Macroeconomics 101 type of error is to use PPP-based time series, just as in the PNAS 2009 paper.

Given that Japan was until recently the world's #2 economy and remains #1 in complexity per Hidalgo & Hausmann's metric, it's surprising, to say the least, that neither CH nor any of the distinguished advance readers of the book who provided back cover quotes were familiar with recent Japanese economic history. Nor with the history of the UK, another of the 8% Google-growers: if growth were as spectacular as the book suggests, how in the world did John Major manage to lose the election to Labour in 1997? Nor did any of them notice that the shape and scatter of Fig. 15 are entirely different from the PNAS 2009 version, which would suggest some artifact in the new data set. I appreciate CH's openness about his change in source. But I wonder if it might have been more prudent to stick with the PNAS graph after all.

3. SYNTHESIS ISSUES

Here I'll focus on three particular discourses that connect ""information"" to economics.

(a) Bugatti discourse:

CH mentions that a Chilean paid $2.5 million for a Bugatti Veyron, and observes that of course no one would pay that for a Bugatti that's been smashed against a wall. ""This is another way of saying that the $2.5 million worth of value was stored not in the car's atoms, but in the way those atoms were arranged. That arrangement is information. [¶] So the value of the Bugatti is connected to physical order, which is information .... [I]nformation is a measure of the minimum volume of communication required to uniquely specify a message. That is, it's the number of bits we need to communicate an arrangement, like the arrangement of atoms that made the Bugatti."" (@12-13.) Later he refines this by specifying that there is an equivalence class of atomic arrangements that could have the same value, e.g., a Bugatti whose tires have been rotated (@20).

For the moment, I'll accept CH's comment about information about atomic arrangements being the minimum volume of communication, etc. -- i.e., information in its IT sense. Even so, the notion that the Bugatti's value comes only from the arrangement of its atoms is nonsense.

The value of the Bugatti comes not only from the arrangement of its atoms, but from social MEANING. Suppose a Bugatti Veyron has a lot of B's and V's on it. Now suppose those letters signified a Buick Verano: still $2.5M? Or suppose I tell a prospective buyer that the Bugatti was assembled in an area of Syria controlled at the time by ISIS. Will she still be so confident about the workmanship? Or suppose the car pops up in a society where no one has ever heard about Bugattis, and people use it as a planter for growing vegetables. Etc., etc.

Aristotle teaches us that the prices of goods are arbitrary and established by social convention (Politics, Book I). The 19th Century neoclassicals, along with some of their intellectual forebears (like J.-B. Say), tell us the same: Léon Walras famously declared that the utility of the same phial of medicine may be greater to someone who plans to use it for murdering his family than to a doctor who plans to use it for saving a sick child. It's not surprising that the book overlooks this, though: CH shows little sensitivity to the history of economic thought, as when he declares that around 1906 ""[e]conomics did not need psychology"" (@xiii). In fact, that was the absolute heyday of psychological utility, as in Walras, Edgeworth, Slutsky, Pareto and others.

There's also a more technical objection to this discourse: how can one communicate the positions of the *different types* of atoms in the Bugatti, distinguishing iron atoms from molybdenum, carbon, etc. using only 1s and 0s? Even if you're talking about a single-element crystal like a diamond, how do you communicate the positions of atoms without some convention about word length, etc.? I.e., the issue of meaning comes up in this context too. It's the same as running an object file: it will generally only work on a particular type of processor, and be meaningless on others. Shannon was concerned only with a signal, not a signal that represents something. But if you want to use a digital sequence to communicate an arrangement of something else, you're smack in the realm of representation.

The Bugatti discourse bears a striking similarity to certain views of Ayn Rand. In an essay called ""The Metaphysical versus the Man-Made,"" collected in ""Philosophy: Who Needs It,"" Rand says ""The power to rearrange the combinations of natural elements is the only creative power man possesses. It is an enormous and glorious power -- and it is the only meaning of the concept `creative.' ... Creation means the power to bring into existence an arrangement (or combination or integration) of natural elements that had not existed before. (This is true of any human product, scientific or esthetic: man's imagination is nothing more than the ability to rearrange the things he has observed in reality.)"" This theme got picked up by the economist Paul Romer, who gave several interviews where he spoke about obtaining value for economic growth from rearrangements of the elements from the Periodic Table, and the value of ""recipes"" for doing so. Indeed his 1990 version of endogenous growth theory is supremely John Galt-ish, being hard-wired so that the value added by labor pales in comparison to that added by ""ideas."" CH acknowledges being influenced by Romer, and aside from its overall Prometheanism the book has plenty of passages extolling creative geniuses, including the story of poor Boltzmann, a chapter entitled ""Out of Our Heads!"" about genius inventors and the ""favors"" that Michael Faraday did for us, and even the Acknowledgments that chronicle CH's violent and messy creative torments. To be fair, though, CH doesn't give any sign of endorsing Rand's culture of self-interest, so her influence may have been indirect only.

(b) Cosmic whirlpool discourse:

CH tells us several times we're exceptional when it comes to information, e.g. ""We can think of our planet as a little whirlpool of information in an otherwise vast and barren cosmos"" (@30; see also xx, 181). I read this together with the statements (I) and (II) mentioned above in Section 1, in which an ""information-rich"" bathtub whirlpool emerges naturally from the steady state of a physical system that's out of equilibrium (an SSOOE system).

OK, so let's consider: either the type of information that emerges from natural SSOOE systems is qualitatively the same as the information involved in the human economy, or it isn't.

First, let's suppose they're the same. Then CH is simply wrong in his cosmic assertions. There are SSOOE structures *throughout* the universe. Here are a few: The spots and bands on Jupiter and the other gas giant planets of our Solar System (and presumably in other solar systems as well). Sunspots and chromospheric granularity on our Sun, and presumably on many of the ca. 10^22 other stars in the visible universe. Spiral arms in our Galaxy and in a sizeable fraction of the other ca. 10^11 galaxies. The distribution of galaxies in our universe. (See chapter 1 of Cross & Greenside for a few more cosmic examples.) If our bathtubs are generating the same type of information as our economy, then so are these puppies. What we produce is pretty insignificant.

Alternatively, suppose the information in our economy is qualitatively different from the stuff in our bathtub. Then all the physics mumbo-jumbo about Boltzmann, physical order, etc. is sheer empty pretentiousness.

Take your pick.

(c) What-the-economy-does discourse:

Arguably, this discourse is distributed throughout the book in the ""crystallized information"" metaphor for manufactured products, but CH puts it explicitly early on: ""Information, when understood in its broad meaning as physical order, is what our economy produces. It is the *only* thing we produce, whether we are biological cells or manufacturing plants."" (@xix, emphasis in original.)

Wouldn't the the practice of recycling old computer equipment, vehicles, and other products be an obvious counter-example to this claim? If assembling a Bugatti is producing information, what does stripping one amount to?

But what really qualifies this statement as being not just nonsense but dangerous nonsense is that it ignores the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and the fact that all real production processes create waste. To be clear: I'm not alluding here to the argument of the late Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen that we can't clean things up adequately because our stock of ""low entropy"" is becoming depleted. (For a critique of NG-R's argument, please see my Amazon review of ""The Entropy Law and the Economic Process"" and references mentioned therein.) Rather, I mean that as a matter of practical fact, we do create waste and *don't* clean it up.

CH invokes plants and ecosystems for the sake of an analogy about networks of economic knowledge and knowhow (Ch. 11), but this book is completely silent about the non-metaphorical impact of economic activity on the environment. Many toxic metals, such as mercury, naturally occur in high concentration within ores, but thanks to economic activity have wound up highly dispersed in bodies of water and in soils, where they can have residence times of centuries. The burning of fossil fuels produces waste heat and gases that enter the atmosphere, and nuclear plants inject waste heat (and much else, thinking about Fukushima Dai-Ichi) into aqueous ecosystems. By no stretch is any of these cases one of enhanced physical order ""a/k/a"" information. For a 21st Century physicist to tell a popular audience that the *only* thing economic activity produces is ""information"" is tantamount to climate change denialism (actually, denialism about a whole slew of man-made environmental ills). That's all the more the case when the production of information is presented as humans' triumph over the barren universe. It's not only physically incorrect, it's deeply irresponsible.

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The writing style is generally easy to read, all the more an accomplishment because CH isn't native in English (I presume). Still, there are a fair number of unfortunate metaphors and over-the-top passages that his editors and other readers should have counselled him to prune back. E.g., ""Our planet is to information what a black hole is to matter and a star is to energy"" (@x): what does this mean? Black holes suck in matter -- is that what our planet does with information? Or the concluding paragraph (@181), which speaks of ""our planet continu[ing] its rebellious path marked by pockets that are rich in information"" -- this suggests the pockets are in the path, but the rest of the book suggests they're in the planet. (And maybe there isn't even a path: see (III) discussed in Section 1 above.) We are ""enslaved by the growth of order"", so is it reasonable to expect we can also appreciate ""the beauty of information"" if order is the same thing? (@id.) And we're told that a ""godless creation ... has now been bestowed upon us"": bestowed by Whom? (@id.) I won't dwell on the Acknowledgments, other than to say that they were, ironically for this book's theme, TMI. (Life imitates art: see Paul Theroux's 1979 New Yorker story, ""Acknowledgments,"" anthologized in, e.g., ""Sudden Fiction International"" (1989)). The book has endnotes without any bibliography, but the notes section is brief, so finding sources isn't as difficult as in some other recent books.

I usually try to cut young researchers some slack when reading their books. Unfortunately, the quantity and quality of problems with this book limited the extent to which I could do so. I can only suggest and hope that CH will take somewhat more time and care to do better on his next attempt. There's a good reason why an attempted grand synthesis like this is more typically the product of a scholar's later years.",156

Todd,5.0 out of 5 stars,Visual Complexity: Mapping Patterns of Information,A fantastic work - and a recommendation,"If you want to improve your ability to analyze and visualize data, this is an excellent book to read.

If you're looking for click-by-click advice on how to make your next PowerPoint prettier, you might get frustrated by this book. But if you're interested in making your graphs more information-rich and analysis-friendly, you've come to the right place.

If you're interested in this book, I also highly recommend Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward Tufte - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0961392142/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0961392142&linkCode=as2&tag=todmedblo-20&linkId=2XHU3RHNLTB7QJCS

Lima's book is in many ways a modern counterpart to Tufte's, discussing analysis and visualization in a world of networks and big data. While both are fantastic reads for the data nut, I still believe that Tufte's is more useful for someone looking to get a first crash course at understanding data.

Du Nguyen,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age,Hackers and painters is a book which reads like a collection of random essays,"Hackers and painters is a book written by Paul Graham who ran a startup in the 1990’s which was later sold to Yahoo. He is now running Y Combinator.

Hackers and painters is a book which reads like a collection of random essays. The first few chapters is about the start of computing and about childhood while later chapters are about both starting a startup and socioeconomic policies. The last chapters are about programming languages where he strongly argues for lisp.

Anyone so have read one of his essays know how well articulate Graham can be and the this book is no exception. The chapters themselves are really well written even though he sometimes argues unconvincingly.

In the end I did not feel that this book was anything else than a collection of essays and while some are interesting, it does not save the entire book. A stronger focus and some narrative between the chapters would improve this book immensely.",2
Bas Vodde,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age,A fun read,"Paul Graham's ""Hackers and Painters"" is a collection of separate articles from Paul. The articles are well written and funny, though I frequently did not agree with the content. Since one of the earlier articles was on censorship, I'd say... that was probably the intention :)

The first article is triggered by Pauls growing up and asks why nerds are unpopular when you are younger. He explores memories of his childhood and tries to clarify them. He continues with a article after which the book is named. He explains that he has *some* education in painting and explores the similarity between hacking and painting.

The next couple chapters are an attack to taboos in general. What can we say? Why can we say that? And he claims that hackers are more comfortable breaking taboos, breaking the rules.

In the article ""The road ahead"" he is making predictions related to web-based server software, of which some are insightful (or were insightful). He claims that server-based software will be the future and the recent years have certainly shown that to be true.

The next couple of articles relate to capitalism and I did disagree with a lot of the statements he made in here. Though, often his points are carefully crafts.. here I found them simplistic. It annoyed me and even thought about stop reading it. The well-written-ness made me continue though.

The middle of the book contains an article about spam. This one doesn't fit well in the book and could have better left out, in my opinion.

The last articles in the book relate to programming languages and were fun to read. Paul is a serious Lisp fan and tries to argue about programming languages in such a way that it always supports his chose of lisp. He does make a couple of good points.

All in all, I've enjoyed reading ""Hackers & Painters"". Its an easy read with interesting strong opinions from Paul. I'd rate it between 3 and 4 stars, mainly because the amount of learning is not high. Though, I remember some articles got me laughing out loud, so decided to go for a 4.

Graham has a knack for distilling the essence of things: high schools as holding pens, hacking as a craft, money as a way to move wealth, programming languages as chairs, etc. Two questions seem to drive Graham's writing process: What is the broadest thing that can be said about X without being false? And how can I say it in the simplest manner possible? It's this joint process of abstraction (of content) and simplification (of form) that results in really good essays.

But what is it? Is it a business book, or a technical book? A bit of both actually, with a pinch of social criticism thrown in. There are essays on business --- particularly startups --- and essays on programming languages and how to combat spam, and one delightful one on the difficulty being a nerd in American public schools.
My favorite essay of the 15 --- and picking a favorite is itself a challenge --- is called ""What you can't say"". It is about heresy, not historical Middle Ages burned-at-the-stake heresy, but heresy today in 2004. And if you believe nothing is heretical today, that no idea today is so beyond the pale that it would provoke a purely emotional reaction to its very utterance, then read some of the other reviews. Graham's idea is not that all heresies are worth challenging publicly, or even that all heresies are wrong, but merely that there is value is being aware of what is heretical, so one can notice where the blind spots are.

My excitement upon learning about the book immediately led me to reserve a copy of it. The book amazed me with its rigor and the quality of its research. I have to say that I learned a good amount from it which, of course, made me very happy!

I would like to end by recommending that Visual Complexity be an essential reference to all of us who work in visualizing data, from all fields of knowledge, not only designers. Above all, it is a must-have for communication design college students (and instructors). It will be a required book in all of my information design courses. I am certain Visual Complexity will impart both inspiration and information to all who read it.",33
Justin M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Visual Complexity: Mapping Patterns of Information,"Visually gorgeous, intellectually stunning","People interested in and fascinated by gorgeous data and network visualization will love this book.

Lima has done a masterful job of researching and showcasing some of the most beautiful visualizations in the world. However he has actually gone much, much further.

The book contains deep original research on the origins of visual representation, the emergence of networks and network thinking, as well as exploring a new syntax for mapping complex systems. All of this makes for something far more sophisticated than a compendium of pretty infographics -- even though aesthetes will be very much satisfied! -- instead it is an ambitious and intellectually significant dive into the very heart of networks, the desire to understand data, and the practice of discerning insights from their visualization.

A particular highlight are the jaw-dropping comparisons between Jackson Pollock's art and network visualizations in the chapter on 'Complex Beauty'. Lima compares one Jackson Pollock painting with a computer-generated model produced by an IBM supercomputer mapping millions of neuron connections in the brain. The two images, side-by-side, are eerily similar. It gives you the tingling sensation that Pollock's work was less raw artistic explosions and more a representation of what he was 'seeing' deep inside into his brain.

All up, an immensely valuable contribution to an exciting and emerging phenomenon. Brilliant for people interested in beautiful visualizations and perfect for those wanting to delve a little deeper into what's really going on.

'Visual Complexity' is taking pride of place on top of my coffee table.",22
Jaume Nualart,2.0 out of 5 stars,Visual Complexity: Mapping Patterns of Information,"Great images, but captions not readable","I liked the book. Lima is a guru on visualization and visualcomplexity is a reference, that's clear.
My critics are about the book layout, specifically the font color on all the image captions. The captions are unreadable for me.

The book is a great resource to utilize, but there are a distinct lack of examples. You'll absolutely need to supplement this book with something else--educational videos online are a great resource.

I used this book in a Theory class, and it was really difficult. Going from DFAs to NFAs to PDAs were pretty simple, but the jump to Turing Machines was incredibly difficult... I had trouble learning it from this book and had to find other places.

If my teacher did not assign problems from the book, I would not have not have bought it. I don't think it impacted how I learned the subject in any way, so save your money if it's an optional buy.",2

Erik Gfesser,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Schema The Complete Reference,Best dimensional modeling text,"For technologists looking for a thorough exploration of the traditional data warehouse star schema, nothing compares to this book. Other reviewers are correct that although works by Ralph Kimball are classics in this space, the content that Adamson provides here is presented in much greater detail with a far greater quantity of examples, and written very well. While I found myself referencing ""The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling"" by the aforementioned author during a recent data warehouse project, because that resource is introductory many practitioners will likely end up referring to the design tips that The Kimball Group website offers as supplementary material on a more frequent basis, and many of these design tips are really only a point in the right direction.

So to get to the point, Adamson offers great advice and explicit step-by-step explanations for many star schema topics. The only area that the author does not delve into is material around specific database products, but readers should be able to research this information after following along with the presentation that the author offers with this work. After discussing the fundamentals of analytic databases and dimensional design, data warehouse architectures, and stars and cubes, the author offers detailed presentations on fact tables, dimensions, hierarchies, bridges, snowflakes, and slowly changing dimensions, followed by discussions on performance and additional topics of interest for developers of dimensional models, including an exploration of some common dimensional features that often strain business intelligence tools, techniques to mitigate any shortcomings, and short discussions on process, design, and documentation.

One great example of the thoroughness of this book is the presentation that the author offers in Chapter 10 (""Recursive Hierarchies and Bridges""). After discussing types of recursive hierarchies (balanced versus unbalanced and attribute-based versus instance-based), reporting challenges associated with recursive hierarchies, and the process and implications with flattening such hierarchies, Adamson delves into the hierarchy bridge, providing a detailed walkthrough of how to construct it and use it, how to avoid double-counting, how to hide the bridge from novice users, how to resolve the many-to-many relationship, and how to handle Type 2 changes to the hierarchy. The step-by-step explanation of this last item is especially well done, with great diagrams and a detailed discussion of the ripple effect of such changes and why you should not resist the ripple effect, despite the additional data involved. This explanation contrasts markedly with other material on this subject. While a single design tip called ""Help for Hierarchies"" from The Kimball Group, for example, discusses this subject, it is done so at a very high level.

As a data architect working through this book for the first time during a project, most of my time was spent in Part 3 (""Dimensional Design""), which breaks down into Chapter 6 (""More on Dimensional Tables""), Chapter 7 (""Hierarchies and Snowflakes""), Chapter 8 (""More Slow Change Techniques""), Chapter 9 (""Multi-Valued Dimensions and Bridges""), and Chapter 10 (""Recursive Hierarchies and Bridges""), although I did spend significant time with Chapter 4 (""A Fact Table for Each Process""), Chapter 11 (""Transactions, Snapshots, and Accumulating Snapshots""), and Chapter 12 (""Factless Fact Tables""). While I will likely continue to reference a number of other resources in this space, this is the one book currently in the marketplace that has staying power for the long-term. Highly recommended.",3
Robert Blackburn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Schema The Complete Reference,Great book on dimensional modeling,"The book is broken down into six parts:

I. Fundamentals
II. Multiple Stars
III. Dimension Design
IV. Fact Table Design
V. Performance
VI. Tools and Documentation

This is a very natural and logical progression through data modeling and ETL implications. You can read the book from beginning to end and/or use it as a reference when faced with a particular challenge. Star Schema covers a wide range of scenarios with examples that can be easily extrapolated to other industries or your particular data.

Even being in IT, IT books can be dry. However, Christopher’s writing style is that of a mentor. He walks you through each topic with examples. Often, I came up with a question only to be answered on the next page. This keeps the reader engaged and that makes for a deeper understanding of the material. Not every Customer Dimension or Sales Fact is modeled the same. After you know the concepts and the data, you can produce the best design.

From Conformed Dimensions to Recursive Hierarchies and Bridges, you will see your data and your data model in a new light. Every system needs a strong foundation. This book will help you develop a solid dimensional model that will support and grow as your business does.",1
Jaewoo Kim,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Schema The Complete Reference,Great for both Star and Snowflake Schemas,"This book really deserves its 5 stars. It is, by far, the best book on data warehousing I have ever read.

Not only is the content very precise and comprehensive, but it is also very well written.

Data Warehousing concepts are notoriously difficult to explain. That's why so many well-meaning DW books comes short. If you can only read one book on DW design, then make it this one.

Contrary to the title, the book covers Snowflake Schema quite adeptly, and the author is careful to list all the pros and cons of going from Star to Snowflake. That leap from star to snowflake should always be taken with considerable thought.

The book is light both on data analytics and ETL. This book is almost all about Star and Snowflake schemas.

Pros:
1)The best book on data warehousing design I have ever read.
2)Comprehensive AND in-depth coverage of both Star and Snowflake schemas.
3)Very well written.

Cons:
1)Doesn't cover much outside of data warehousing. It has light coverage of data analytics and ETL.",13
Emmanuel Oga,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Schema The Complete Reference,"Nice, thoughtful treatment of data warehousing subjects","This is a great book about data warehousing. Most people will embark into the task of building data warehousing without knowing what they are getting into... only to reinvent (likely in a half baked way) concepts that have been implemented long ago by data warehouse designers. Some people heard ""data warehouse"" and automatically think of Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle... but the concepts in this books are applicable whether you are using one of those databases, mysql, postgresql or whatever you use to get analytic data out of your operational data store.",2
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Star Schema The Complete Reference,Absolutely Wonderful.,"I have been working designing and developing OLTP databases for 20 years. I am new to Data warehouses and picked up this book based on reviews and I don't have any regrets. I have completed 4 out of 18 chapters ~ 85 pages. I love the way Chris analyses each topic from different angles and explains the pros and cons of each approach. I am fully satisfied with this purchase and would say that this is a great book to clear the concepts of database design for warehouses, which, is very different from OLTP designs.

The book is well organized for reading end to end and also provides a great reference while in the development process. I've had my copy for only 2 months and it's well worn by my constant usage. This book has provided exactly what I needed to completely understand the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to solve real world business problems with the dimensional model.

The premise is perfect: science examining art and thus illuminating human condition. Well, examine it did, illuminate – not so much. I found myself simultaneously impressed with the depth of the research and disappointed with the triviality of the findings. Moreover, as much as the authors hope that their formula will open publishing industry to new writers overlooked otherwise, I have a feeling it will only serve to build more, higher walls, imprisoning writers in even tighter cells. Ironically, what would mediate the potential for abuse is making the formula available to the public in the form of a readily accessible test.

I will admit I love data and how concrete it is. As a creative who straddles the line between that and the analytical, this truly scratched my itch. I'm currently working on a book that will be finished in mere days. After reading this book (in one setting of an afternoon), I took my notes and takeaways and revisited what I'd written.
Mistakes that I'd never have seen blared at me. Not the normal mistakes of grammar or developmental issues--no mistakes that would have sent my book into the abyss of Meh. With a few tweaks here and there, my manuscript now gets me excited. I was able to change my perception of my writing to provide the entertainment ride it should be.
I will not attempt to tell you what I did, because I believe this books should be experienced in the customization of your own needs as a writer. I will say that I found the graphs they provided on pacing, the tips on theme and their examination of ""The Girl"" books and how 50 Shades and Da Vinci Code could be twins to be very illuminating.
This book may not be for you if you do not enjoy the value of data, have the ability to grasp the data and then conceptualize it into how it pertains to you or believe that a computer can read a book and then tell you how to make yours better.

Ralph White,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Bestseller Code: Anatomy of the Blockbuster Novel,Junk Science for Junk Writers,"This book will not provide the literary alchemy required to transmute your leaden manuscript into a golden book. It does contain some common sense observations which are not derived from the authors’ model, but a rational person must be skeptical of the notion that text mining and analysis of “word clouds” can be predictive of a book’s commercial success.. There are a lot of problems with the authors’ analytics, and even more with their presentation. Where to start?

- There's no surprise “the Code” (also called “the Model” or the “Bestseller-ometer”) works so well. Success was built in since historic bestsellers are already known, so when they are programmed into the model it “predicts” they’ll sell well. What The Code can’t do is predict the success of an unpublished novel.
- Science is peer-reviewable and this bestseller-ometer hasn’t been peer reviewed. To do that a double-blind test would have to be made by independent investigators to determine if the model produced the claimed results. It would not.
- The authors claim to have analyzed 5 thousand novels published in the last 30 years. First of all, they probably didn’t. Second, predicting future results from past performance is fraught (see Enron and Lucent stock prices). Modern literary tastes differ significantly from those of the past and you are not planning to sell your novel into a 1980s readership or to a Borders store.
- In your heart, Dear Reader, do you honestly believe that when 5 thousand novels were “DNA deconstructed” by the bestseller-ometer, that it could produce the lists on pages 70-71? There is only one way that could have happened and that is for the model to pick up key words like “Jodi Picault,” “David Baldacci,” “Nora Roberts,” “Stephen King,” and “Paulo Coelho” as part of its analytic filtering. Again, hindsight is difficult to overrate.
- Consider these supposedly surprising conclusions revealed by the model. A bestseller must have a dominant theme comprising roughly a third of its word count. And that topic must appeal to millions of readers. And it must have “human closeness.” And, my favorite revelation, conflict drives novels. Who knew?
- If you aren’t put off by the book’s inane claims by page 88, consider the graph of the “measured beats” (a key modeling predictor) in Fifty Shades. You may or may not notice that the vertical axis on the chart is not labeled. That is because “measured beat” is a vague concept, not a scientifically measureable variable. In fact the wavy line on the chart is just a freehand depiction of something, maybe tension, which, by the way, the model can discern infallibly.
- Knowing what you now know about this freehand line derived from Fifty Shades how amazed are you by the authors’ claim that it precisely overlays the freehand line representing the rising and falling of tension in DaVinci Code? Are you awestruck that those two wavy lines are the only two which are exactly alike among the 5 thousand books over 30 years whose DNA were deconstructed by the model? Recall what they say about something too good to be true.
- Do you sincerely believe that a word cloud identification model can determine whether the book has a killer hook in the first 40 pages? What would a hook look like in a word cloud?

This book is junk science and it relies on a scientifically illiterate readership (and St. Martin’s Press’s promotional budget) for any success. If the authors’ research had taken them back further than thirty years they might have data-mined the inspiration for their bestseller-ometer, P.T. Barnam’s quote, “A sucker is born every minute.”",5

David B. Mignery,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Bestseller Code: Anatomy of the Blockbuster Novel,Where's the Good Stuff?,"As a novelist, I was interested in the insights this book might offer as to what most readers of novels are looking for. It does provide some insight, however I was very surprised at what was left out. I won't try to explain how the author's computers analyzed books except that they apparently accumulated considerable data on the frequency of certain themes, topics, plot-lines, names, words, word categories, and phrases that appeared in bestsellers as opposed to non-best sellers. Most bestsellers don't appeal to me as a reader, and, as an author, I’m not particularly interested in writing that type of book. But, as an author, I am interested in finding an audience.

As the authors and several reviewers point out, this book is not intended to help authors write bestsellers, however, it would have been very instructive to any author to learn which themes, topics, plot-lines, names, words, word categories, and phrases appear most often in bestsellers as opposed to non-bestsellers. Such data could have been easily shared with us, but, inexplicably, it is almost completely absent in this book. It would also have been interesting to see this data provided for separate genres, as well as for those non-bestsellers which achieved widespread critical success.

The authors do provide lists of bestsellers relative to certain themes, topics, and plot-lines in order of conformance to the computer’s criteria for bestsellerdom, but these lists seem to be essentially useless. All this leaves me with the question – why did Archer and Jockers leave the most interesting and useful parts of their research out?",2
crazypoet,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Bestseller Code: Anatomy of the Blockbuster Novel,A Mishmash of Pseudo-Statistical Analysis,"There's a small amount of original and useful research here but the majority of it is a bunch of either obvious stuff or far too vague to be meaningful.

For example, the authors will talk about how titles should or shouldn't use ""The,"" cite their data, and basically conclude that there are plenty of examples of both. Or that some data shows that a noun/adjective between ""The"" and the ""Object"" is bad, except when it's good. Not to mention all the examples that fit neither.

Personally, I think the entire methodology is deeply suspect. It's a sort of after-the-fact statistical overfitting. Both of the authors are from the literature / editorial side of the business, which would be fine if that's the kind of material they were presenting. But they attempt to get into statistical analysis. Two English major types! I assure you, they have no idea what they are doing. It's a bit like asking a fisherman for his Michelin 3-star recipes. Just because they know one aspect of food doesn't mean they know another. If they had an actual statistics expert look at this, I think they would either have been dissuaded from publication or it would be greatly improved. But that didn't happen and instead you get pseudo-statistical gobbledygook.

And then of course there's this issue: none of their ""analysis"" has anything to do with quality, usefulness, meaning, or beauty. If your sole goal in life is to figure out how to generate total crap that sells -- longshot that this would truly help even with that but I guess possible -- then maybe you can find something in here to get yourself published in some bare minimum way, especially if you're a first time author, don't read much, and have absolutely no idea what makes a good book, and don't really care.

Oh, and it's not particularly well organized.

For me, as I look back on it, I truly can't think of a single takeaway or useful bit of information that I gleaned from the entire book. Not a single sentence, idea, or suggestion stands out. The only reason I'm not giving them one star is due to their enthusiasm and, I think, sincere intentions.",1
Lynn S. Bay,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Bestseller Code: Anatomy of the Blockbuster Novel,How to do it without a computer.,"While I don't think one, even a computer, can entirely figure out what makes a bestseller, this book gave enough instances of what parts many have in them to make for an interesting, informative ""wild-ass"" guess. Overall, most contain the same elements, but so many things can go wrong: Style of writing, subject matter and even time of year. That being said, years ago, most authors are encouraged to ""take apart"" their favorite books; looking for reasons that certain passages and rhythms are successful. So one doesn't really need a computer, but it would be quicker. I enjoyed this book and how the authors explained their algorithms use.",2
MJBeebe,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Bestseller Code: Anatomy of the Blockbuster Novel,Incredible insight into the common elements of bestselling novels,"With their gripping Bestseller Code, Archer and Jockers have done a great service to authors and readers. Their research does not provide a prescription for writing a best selling novel, but it does provide authors with some insight into the common elements of successful books. The authors, using algorithms to read, parse and measure books, identified certain structural elements involving theme, story arc / pace, voice and character development that were highly correlated with a book’s presence on the best seller list. The methodology was not meant to judge the quality or literary merit of the work they evaluated, but rather its commercial success. Essentially, it identified the things that consistently resonated with readers. Surely, there will be aspiring authors who look to the book for guidance in improving their commercial success, while others will decry the reduction of literature to an algorithmic formula. The exciting reality is that this sort of analysis can be further developed and applied to help authors find the right readers, and help readers find the right book, at the right time.",1

Onlydole,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions",Wonderful Starting Point,"This was a beautiful book that really refueled my interest for Statistics (which I've been struggling to start learning...even though I know calculus and LOVE mathematics)...but it really caught my eye because it goes into detail about the R statistical programming language.

The first few chapters get you going on a specific mindset of how to interpret data, which is VERY important to keep throughout the entire reading of this book.

After that groundwork is established, you are taken on a really cool journey of some Excel features (don't freak out...those of you who don't know excel proficiently will be fine in the hands of this book) that you never would've believed were there! You can even use Google Docs to do the same things if you don't have a valid copy of Excel!

Finally, R comes into play with all its glory...I would've loved for a deeper dive with this technology, but there are several other books out there in which you can get down and dirty with R (http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Programming-Statistical-Software/dp/1593273843/ and http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-OReilly-Cookbooks-Paul-Teetor/dp/0596809158/ are my favorites and I own them both on my kindle).

I hope that eliminates all your FUD's (Fears, Uncertainties, and Doubts)...go and grab this book RIGHT NOW! You'll be blown away with what you'll be able to do after you read everything here!

Page 97 lies in the middle of the ""optimization"" chapter, but you don't get to the punch line on what to do about the ""pretty bad news"" until page 108. The pace of the book is simply too slow--which I attribute to an overuse of the Head First style, a style supposedly ""designed for the way your brain works.""

Shawn Winigman,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Head First Data Analysis: A learner's guide to big numbers, statistics, and good decisions","Good Intro, Poor Quality","Going through this book for introductory Data Analysis elements has been extremely helpful, especially in later chapters utilizing ""R"".

Pros:
1) Great introductory material to Data Analysis, including reporting techniques and later chapters including hands on examples utilizing ""R"".
2) Extremely easy read, was able to cover the material in the span of 1-2 work days and feel as though most of the information has been absorbed.

Cons:
1) The binding is really poor (it might just be my copy). When I opened the book I had a handful of pages just fall out. I needed the book for work, so there wasn't much of an option to wait while returning it. I'll just have to fix the binding myself later.
2) Multiple areas that have typos or missing data. For the most part I was able to figure out what was being explained, but some links for data were incorrect.

Wishes:
1) A section containing data collection techniques would have been wonderful. Sometimes you aren't given the data, and are expected to retrieve the data needed for analysis.
2) A section covering creating models and analysis based on best/worst/average case estimates from subject matter experts. What to do while waiting for needed data.

- implementing data structures from scratch in Java
- using built-in Java library data structures
- algorithms
- solving programming problems
- testing
- UML

It is the selection of topics that makes your time so efficient, the thought that went into that, that makes it unique, if these are the topics you want to learn or brush up on.

Alexander,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Structures: Abstraction and Design Using Java,Concise and informative,"This was the textbook for my data structures and algorithms course. We covered the entire book in the semester.

The professor supplemented the book with some of his own material, in particular the section on graphs which took advantage of the fact that integers can not only be stored in the graph but serve as an array index; so we did something a little more generic that could accept any data type. But the text itself was a pretty good reference even for the supplemented portions of the course.

One nice feature of the book is the refresher on Java. If you are a more experienced programmer but just have forgotten how Java does something, this is a great quick way to look it up without being drowned in largely useless introductory material designed for absolute beginners.

For instance, both models use the term ""phase"" for different characteristics of the abstract process that describes software development. Presenting a less ambiguous treatment of this subject would improve the accessiblity of the work. This is the only criticism that I have of the text. It does a remarkable job at explaining how one translates between iteration and recursion and vice versa.

Christoffer S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Effective Threat Intelligence: Building and running an intel team for your organization,Gentle but shallow introduction to threat intelligence,"This is a brief and rather trivial introduction to threat intelligence. There are no references to other books or articles to substantiate what's being taught and written in the book. Perhaps its worth treating the book like nothing more than a long blog-post.

First of all you'll not learn how to build an effective threat intelligence program. The treatment of metrics and how to properly evaluate your threat intelligence program is, well, trivial as everything else in the book. Did you know that you could send an email, or make a phone call, to disseminate intelligence to a recipient? Well, now you do.

There is not a discussion of how you would collect data, normalise, transform or otherwise prepare collected information and data. How does threat intelligence relate to the various steps of more classic intelligence work? Direction, collection, analysis, feedback etc? How do we know what's being taught is actually effective?

What you'll get, in short, is a brief treatment of threat intelligence and a few pointers to get you started. You'll have to do much more research and studying to understand intelligence collection and analysis. This book will not be enough, not by a long shot.",4

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),wait for the errata to fill in before buying,"Before buying, look at the book description at the publisher's website (oreilly.com) and click on the ""errata"" link. Check to see how long that list is. If you can live with cross-referencing this list with the book, then buy it. Otherwise, there are probably better books out there.

As it is, I am somewhat proficient in R and bought this book as a crash course for a better understanding of the basics, especially the graphics and statistics. After barrelling through roughly half of the book, I found many references to functions or parameters which were never explained or were explained later in the book (without saying so at the first reference). For someone who is hoping for a quick read through most of what R has to offer, this is like hitting a brick wall.

The book helps the reader understand a lot of what R is capable of, but it seems to be done in a more slip-shod manner than I was hoping for. I get the feeling the author was rushed in getting this to print. Or, they didn't pay the editor enough.

Bill y,4.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),"Solid book, covers broad areas, maybe too much on programming","I bought the 1st edition and this one is just as good. Generally he uses straightforward examples and provides enough detail to ""make it work."" So, for example, with just a few pages of reading I can understand how to technically get decision trees to work in R. For the general reader I think Adler spends way too much time on object programming concepts and the behind the scenes structure of R. It would be nice to have time for theoretical detours like he uses but for those of us who are busy and in the commercial world, such material should be relegated to an appendix. I really don't care how R does it, in the same sense that I do not car how my car optimizes its gas/air ratio -- I just want it to go.

That being said, Adler's range of knowledge is astounding and I certainly trust what he says. With just a slight tweak to meet the needs of his less academic readers, the book would be perfect.",1

Erik Gfesser,3.0 out of 5 stars,R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),Not a tutorial or the encyclopedia one would expect,"This book is the second that I purchased this past year to get up to speed on the R language and environment, along with ""R in Action"" and ""R Graphics Cookbook"" (see my reviews), but unlike these other two, I fully expected this book to serve as a reference rather than a tutorial, based on my experience with ""UNIX in a Nutshell"" many years ago. However, through my experience I was quickly made aware of the breadth of the R language, which includes over 2500 packages that have become available to the community, and I have instead typically used this book as a starting point for additional research on websites which cater to the R community, including CRAN (""Comprehensive R Archive Network"").

Even given its near 700-page size, it is difficult for any book to cover R extensively, so I credit this book to continue to provide pointers in the right direction as I gain experience using the language. While ""R in Action"" in its introductory chapters gets one up and running with R more gracefully, chapter 1 (""Getting and Installing R"") and chapter 2 (""The R User Interface"") in this book also provide a glimpse into the many options available with regard to environments. The closest that one will get with a tutorial in this book is the 18-page chapter 3 (""A Short R Tutorial""), but this chapter should really only be considered a way to wet one's appetite with regard to basic operations, functions, variables, data structures, objects and classes, models and formulas, and charts and graphics, as chapters 5 through 10 go over these topics more extensively.

Chapter 11 (""Saving, Loading, and Editing Data"") along with Chapter 12 (""Preparing Data"") provide useful information on working with data, because, like it or not, as with any language most data work revolves around first getting it into the correct format, but although these chapters present more available options in this area than ""R in Action"", these chapters also again read more like an encyclopedia and do not provide any guidance, because as is the case with most of this text, readers are likely best served when they have a decent idea of what they are looking to accomplish.

Most of my use of this book has involved Part 4 (""Data Visualization""), Part 5 (""Statistics with R""), and Part 6 (""Additional Topics""). After experimenting with the packages included with R by default, it is Chapter 15 (""ggplot2"") which led me to purchase ""R Graphics Cookbook"", a well recommended book to learn the ggplot2 package, but it is the other chapters within this part of the book that made me realize that although the ggplot2 package provides standardization that is often lacking with R, no single package is likely to ever serve the needs of a developer, at least over time. Recommended text for those in the earlier stages of using the R language and environment and still finding their way, but not for the neophyte, as this book is not a tutorial, nor is it the encyclopedia one would expect from the ""In a Nutshell"" series.",10

So, there is no conceptual clarity about what IS and what IS NOT emergence. Just vagueness and no rigor.

M. Barr,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software",Read critically,"Very interesting and well written book. The author is pretty constantly pushing the idea that understanding emergence and writing emergent software are the be-all end-all solutions to everything. As a software engineer, I can assure you this is not the truth. In fact, ""the 5 rules of emergence"" need to be carefully and critically digested. I understand that an author in this type of publication needs to choose a strong thesis and defend it well, but please, take the ideas in this book in with a critical eye.",5
Philip Carl,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software",Mainstream Media Meets Complex Adaptive Systems,"The publishing industry continues to fuel the growth of popular science with titles like Emergence. I'm all for the growth of science titles, but the price comes at the increase in the number of watered-down, easy-to-digest material you'll find in bookstores. With the explosion in books written on the topic of complex adaptive systems, I found it difficult to choose a single book in the category. With little restraint, I dove in.
Emergence is a light, easy read devoted to describing systems that demonstrate adaptive behavior. The author sends significant time on contemporary systems such as the news media, the worldwide web, and large urban areas. On more than one occasion, the author appears to be reaching to make a conclusion. It's difficult to say whether he hadn't done the research or wanted the reader to draw his/her own conclusion.
Nonetheless, Steven Johnson paints an abstract picture of systems that demonstrate a larger, collective set of smarts. Like most abstract art, some people will be inspired and others won't. I found the writing and subject matter interesting enough to keep my curiosity fueled to pick up another book on complex systems. If you approach Emergence with a mind-set of getting more art than science, you're less likely to be let down.",11
Craig Scott,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software",Tastes great -- less filling,"As per the previous reviews the book is an exuberant romp through a fascinating field of theory. The first half of the book is wonderful and will get you thinking about things differently (unless you are already well read in the area -- which I am not). The annecdotes regarding ants and cities are great introductory material but I found myself wanting the writer to go a little deeper. Chapters 5 and 6 are a little weak and find the author waxing excitedly about a variety of disconnected threads. The closing section of the book is an interesting attempt to extrapolate current trends into the future -- mostly dwelling on music, film, broadband etc. The futurism would have been more satisfying if it had touched more on other areas of life, medical, manufacturing, but that would have required a far greater leap.

Some of the analogies backfired. The games mentioned don't strike me (or many other reviewers, apparently) as particularly compelling.

O. Halabieh,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google",Account of Utility Computing!,"Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:

1- ""What made large-scale electric utilities possible was a series of scientific and engineering breakthroughs - in electricity generation and transmission as well as in the design of electric motors - but what ensured their triumph was not technology but economics.""

2- ""At a purely economic level, the similarities between electricity and information technology are even more striking. Both are what economists call general purpose technologies...they can both be delivered efficiently over a network.""

3- ""If the electric dynamo was the machine that fashioned twentieth-century society - that made us who we are - the information dynamo is the machine that will fashion the new society of the twenty-first century.""

4- ""What the fiber-optic Internet does for computing is exactly what the alternating current network did for electricity: it makes the location of the equipment unimportant to the user. But it does more than that. Because the internet has been designed to accommodate any type of computer and any form of digital information, it also plays the role of Insull's rotary converter: it allows disparate and formerly incompatible machines to operate together as a single system. It creates harmony out of a cacophony. By providing a universal medium for data transmission and translation, the Net is spurring the creation of centralized computing plants that can serve thousands or millions of customers simultaneously. What companies used to have no choice but to supply themselves, they can now purchase as a service for a simple fee. And that means they can finally free themselves from their digital millwork.""

5- ""It will take many years for the utility computing system to mature. Like Edison and Insull before them, the pioneers of the new industry will face difficult business and technical challenges. They'll need to figure out the best ways to meter and set prices for different kinds of services. They'll need to become more adept at balancing loads and managing diversity factors as demand grows. They'll need to work with governments to establish effective regulatory regimes. They'll need to achieve new levels of security, reliability, and efficiency. Most daunting of all they'll need to convince big companies to give up control over their private systems and begin to dismantle the data centers into which they've plowed so much money. But these challenges will be met just as they were met before. The economics of computing have changed, and it's the new economics that are now guiding progress. the PC age is giving way to a new era: the utility age.""

6- ""Virtualization allows companies - or the utilities that serve them - to regain the high capacity utilization that characterized the mainframe age while gaining even more flexibility that they had during the PC age. It offers the best of both worlds.""

7- ""Some of the old-line companies will succeed in making the switch to the new model of computing; others will fail. But all of them would be wise to study the examples of General Electric and Westinghouse. A hundred years ago, both these companies were making a lot of money selling electricity production components and systems to individual companies. That business disappeared as big utilities took over electricity supply. But GE and Westinghouse were able to reinvent themselves. They became leading suppliers of generators and other equipment to the new utilities, and they also operated or invested in utilities themselves. Most important of all, they built vast new businesses supplying electric appliances to consumers - businesses that only became possible after the arrival of large scale electric utilities.""

8- ""When applications have no physical form, when they can be delivered as digital services over a network, the constraints disappear. Computing is also much more modular than electricity generation. Not only can applications be provided by different utilities, but even the basic building blocks of computing - data storage, data processing, data transmission - can be broken up into different services supplied from different locations by different companies. Modularity reduces the likelihood that the new utilities will form service monopolies, and it gives us, as the users of utility computing, a virtually unlimited array of options.""

9- ""Not only will the Internet tend to divide people with different views, in other words, it will also tend to magnify the differences.""

10- ""All technological change is generational change. The full power and consequence of a new technology are unleashed only when those who have grown up with it become adults and begin to push their outdated parents to the margins. As the older generations die, they take with them their knowledge of what was lost when the new technology arrived, and only the sense of what was gained remains. It's in this way that progress covers its tracks, perpetually refreshing the illusion that where we are is where we were meant to be.""",1
Andrew Sanchez,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google",A grid-cloud comparison,"In his book, The Big Switch, Nicholas Carr related the history of the electric grid from the invention by Edison to the centralization of the grid and used it as a basis for the thesis of the book which is to derive a parallel for the evolution of information technology and processing. The underlying theme in the book is that as a technology matures, it becomes commoditized to gain efficiencies in production and usage and, eventually, it becomes indispensable but also brings with it unintended consequences. The book was divided in two parts which differ in theme and dynamics. The first part was historic and revolved around technology while the second part centered on social implications of technology.
The first section is covered electric and data technology and their evolution. Carr began his discussion with a comprehensive account of electrical energy generation. He started chapter one with the Burden's Wheel and explained that such invention allowed for the increase of productivity but was limited when kinetic energy could not be stored or transported for more than short distances within a factory. Additionally, kinetic energy from the Burden's Wheel required the use of physical conduits such as levers, pulleys and gears. The underlying power source of the Burden's Wheel was running water; therefore, industrial uses of its power were limited.
The second chapter included a detailed account of Edison's venture into the Direct Current (DC) generation as well as the subsequent advent of Alternate Current (AC) which allowed for the centralization of the power grid. In this chapter, Carr initiated the comparison of the electric grid to the information technology (IT) data center. His main idea behind the comparison was that as data processing becomes more and more commoditized, it no longer advantageous for companies to keep their own data center and incur the costs of keeping up an IT staff and operations facility when processing can be provided centrally at a much cheaper cost.
The rest of part covered analogy after analogy that attempts to draw a parallel between the evolutions of the electrical grid and the computing cloud. In chapter three, Carr covered the history of the computer from the early inceptions to the modern data center. The analogies stop making sense when the chapter cites the availability of cheap and vast bandwidth as the basis for cloud computing and AC power. While bandwidth and AC may be similar at some level, AC is pure power while bandwidth is not. He later corrects the analogy and points to the grid but the comparison continues to be a rather weak one from that point on; mainly because he is comparing two very different technologies with two distinct uses and levels of sophistication.
Later in part one he predicts the downfall of Bill Gates and his monopoly on computing as well as the inefficiencies of the data center. In his own logic, Carr argues that computers will become appliances that will require little in the way of customization and that processing and storage will take place entirely in the cloud. While this is happening with some success, it is not realistic to think that all processing can be in the hands of a few companies with centralized locations. The reason is that unlike the electric grid, data processing needs vary widely among companies. Many will undoubtedly require no more than what the cloud offers while others will necessitate vast amounts of processing and storage; not to mention security.
The IT industry has had some successes with the cloud and virtualization but there have also been a lot of failures which have forced companies to switch back to in-house processing and storage. The modularization of the cloud allows for efficient operations but even those operations are nothing more than big data centers which in turn will have their own inefficiencies. Carr makes no distinction between the centralized outsourced data center and the electrical grid with centralized power generation. Nevertheless, they cannot be compared at face value because, unlike electricity generation, processing and storage cannot be done for everyone with one solution. In other words, the electricity current that is used by a residence is only slightly different than the electricity used by the Pentagon and differs only in voltage. However, the processing and storage required by the two are vastly different. The Pentagon will not put its data where it can be reached by someone other than their employees or where it can be made unavailable by some system or power failure.
Overall the first half of the book was very fundamental in nature and included very accurate information about existing technologies and companies in IT. The analogies are at times not the best but Carr makes them work under a certain applied logic. The intended reader should be someone with some knowledge of IT as some of the assumptions and conclusions made by Carr require some analysis and objective questioning.
The second part brings the topic of the cloud to the present and Carr explains the promises of the internet and the worldwide computer. In Carr's view the internet is a web of computers that somehow morphed into a collective and he reasons that the ""big computer"" is better than the individual computers which act independently. One huge misunderstanding on Carr's part is the notion that the worldwide computer acts alone and by its own means. He mentions the advancement of knowledge, innovation and modularity which are all accessible via the web browser. What he does not seem to realize is that computing takes many forms and some are apt for modularization but some are not. Appliances are fine but eventually a web browser has to run on something. Computers fundamentally have not changed at all since the first Apple II. Computers need input, they process the input, they store the processed input and they output something. Appliances are a variation but not much else. All the innovations happened at the higher OSI layers; the top two layers, presentation and application, to be exact. While DC and AC are very different, the cloud and desktops and appliances are not all that different at their core. The cloud is merely a bunch of computers hooked up in a way that they can serve many users at once. This is really not much different than the mainframes and Wyse terminals from the 1970's and 1980's.
The big message that Carr wants to deliver throughout the book is that IT is on its last stand and that computing and end-users will require nothing more than a device with a browser to access all the vaults of information available on the web. What he does not realize, again, is that the cloud needs a lot of maintaining, upgrading, securing, cooling, backing up, cleaning and updating. End users will probably not be able to do all those things. It will require IT specialist to perform those functions. Carr failed to mention that moving the electric generation from the factory-based DC plant to the AC grid did not do away with electrical engineers or the equipment needed to generate electricity; it merely centralized the need.
The rest of the book takes on some interesting topics such as the unexpected consequences of the grid and the elaboration of home appliances which made housewives lives more isolated and even harder, to some degree, than before the electrification of the home. Carr makes the analogy to the notion that the internet would bring the world under a common collective which would interact without geographical and cultural barriers. Carr makes the assertion that the opposite occurred as the internet public became segmented into subcultures and special interest sites. While the arguments make sense, it is not clear where Carr got the idea that people expected the internet to bring the world into a common culture. Since no other medium before the internet had such an effect, there would be little reason to believe that a new medium do somehow erode culture and special interests.
The rest of the book is devoted to topics that the author should not have included such as security and privacy. He describes how easy it is to get anyone's surfing history and buying habits. While this may be easy for an internet service provider (ISP) it is rather difficult for an average user. Carr clearly got into realms of technology he does not fully understand. Although, Carr is able to recite protocol fundamentals, he is not aware of the vast complexity that exists in trying to read packets across switched subnets and behind NATted segments. Unfortunately, he was not able to rescue the end of the book as well as he admirably wrote the beginning.
Overall the book The Big Switch by Nicholas Carr provides much useful information on technology and contains accurate information on IT industry players such as Akamai, 3Tera and Citrix, he got entangled in topics he does not appear to fully understand. The value of the book lies in its detailed narration of the history of the electrical grid, computing and major events in the advent of the cloud. The book also includes well reasoned information on the unintended consequences of technology on society. Carr's book should not be adopted as a technical piece but rather a reasonable analogy between the electrical grid and cloud computing. There is no formal research, new models or any academic value; however, it presents a good representation into the popular view of the modularization of processing and storage.",1
David C. Casler,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google",Really two books in one,"For those who know or care about the infrastructure undergirding our technology revolution, this is a must-read book. The thesis is simple: we're at a tipping point where ""utility computing"" will quickly replace in-house data centers. It sounds simple, but the implications are not. The first half of the book lays out and describes the revolution, sometimes in breathless terms. The second half is much darker, however, detailing projected consequences. The author points out that a number of popular websites these days have nearly zero staff--the content comes from users and the infrastructure is rented utility computing from the likes of Google and Amazon. This means that huge online businesses do not translate to employment. In the past, when industries, such as electrical utilities, have undergone major transformation, people lost jobs, but new jobs were available using different skills. The author has a gloomy outlook here: the lost jobs may not be replaced. I suspect the real outcome will be a bit better. People are inventive and new technologies (perhaps not electronic) will need people. Overall, a great book, but I do think the second half is rather darker than it needs to be.",1

Robert David STEELE Vivas,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google","Very Worthwhile, One Major Flaw","This is a very worthwhile easy to absorb book. The author is thoughtful, well-spoken, with good notes and currency as of 2007.

The one major flaw in the book is the uncritical comparison of cloud computing with electricity as a utility. That analogy fails when one recognizes that the current electrical system wastes 50% of the power going down-stream, and has become so unreliable that NSA among others is building its own private electrical power plant--with a nuclear core, one wonders? While the author is fully aware of the dangers to privacy and liberty, and below I recap a few of his excellent points, he disappoints in not recognizing that localized resilience and human scale are the core of humanity and community, and that what we really need right now, which John Chambers strangely does not appear willing to offer, is a solar-powered server-router that gives every individual Application Oriented Network control at the point of creation (along with anonymous banking and Grug distributed search), while also creating local pods that can operate independently of the cloud while also blocking Google perverted new programmable search, wherer what you see is not what's in your best interests, but rather what the highest bidder paid to force into your view.

The author cites one source as saying that Google computation can do a task at one tenth of the cost. To learn more, find my review, ""Google 2.0: The Calculating Predator"" and follow the bread crumbs.

The author touches on software as a service, and I am reminded of the IBM interst in ""Services Science."" He has a high regard for Amazon Web Services, as I do, and I was fascinated by his suggestion that Amazon differs from Google, Amazon doing virtualization while Google does task optimization (with computational mathematics). Not sure that is accurate, Google can flip a bit tomorrow and put bankers, entertainers, data service providers, and publishers out of business.

I completely enjoyed th discussion of the impact of electrification and the rise of the middle class, of the migration from World Wide Web to World Wide Computer, and of the emergence of a gift ecnomy.

The author also touches on the erosion of the middle class, citing Jagdish Bhagwati and Ben Bernake as saying that it is the Internet rather than globalization that is hurting the middle class (globalization moved the low cost jobs, the Internet moved the highly-educated jobs).

I was shocked to learn that Google can listen to my background sound via the microphone, meaning that Google is running the equivalent of a warrantless audio penetration of my office. ""Do No Evil?"" This is very troubling.

Page 161: ""A company run by mathematicians and engineers, Google seemsx oblivious to the possible social costs of transparent personalization."" Well said. The only thing more shocking to me is the utter complacency of the top management at Amazon, IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. Search for the article by Steve Arnold, the world's foremost non-Google expert on Google, look for <Google Pressure Wave: Do the Big Boys Feel It?>.

The author touches on Internet utility to terrorists, and our military's vulnerability, but he does not get as deeply into this as he could have. The fact is the Chinese can take out our telecommunications satellites anytime they want, and they are not only hacking into our computers via the Internet, they also appear to have perfected accessing ""stand-alone"" computers via the electrical connection. See <Chinese Irregular Warfare oss.net>.

The portion ofthe book I most appreciated was the authors discussion of lost privacy and individuality. He says ""Computer systems are not at their core technologies of emancipation. They are technologies of control."" He goes on to point out that even a decentralized cloud network can be programmed to monitor and control, and that is precisely where Google is going, monitoring employees and manipulating consumers.

He touches on semantic web but misses Internet Economy Meta Language (Pierre Levy) and Open Hypertextdocument System (Doug Englebart).

He credits Google founders with wanting to get to all information in all languages all the time, and I agree that their motives are largely worthy, but they are out of control--a suprnational entity with zero oversight. I can easily envision the day coming when in addition to 27 secessionist movements across the USA, we will hundreds of virtual secessions in which communities choose to define trusted computing as localized computing.

The book ends beautifully, by saying we will not know where IT is going until our children, the first generation to be wired from day one, become adults.

Christian Claborne,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google",The History of Power Generation,"After reading the book, the summation or description provided by Amazon above captures the core of the author's message. The first part of the book drags you through the beginnings of the electric power generation industry and how it grew and developed into what we have today. The author then uses this as an analogy to support his view that ""utility computing"" will replace corporate datacenters we have today. This long history wasn't necessary for the point to be delivered.

One thing this is frequently skipped over is hardware as a service and it's implementation and role that it plays in the growth and success of SaaS.

The author touched on some of the social and business impacts he sees and the impact that it has had on anyone that creates content that can be digitized. The rest of the book covered various observations about the impact of the Internet on society and business that can be found in just about any other Web 2.0 book out there.

This book continues the trend of taking a magazine article that touches the touches on the epicenter of Internet 2.0 that is so popular. ""Everything is Miscellaneous"" is another example. My opinion is that this book should have stayed as a magazine article. I don't recommend it unless it's the only Web 2.0 book you read.",16
Mark P. McDonald,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google",The Big Switch in Many Ways,"Nicholas Carr's latest book The Big Switch is not the book that many would expect, in fact its better. Carr, who made his fame by making the assertion that IT doesn't Matter and then asking the question Does IT matter? deals with this subject for about 10% of the book. The remainder concentrates on Carr's looking forward to business, society, politics and the world we are creating. It's a welcome switch as it enables Carr to discuss broader issues rather than hammering on a narrow point.

The net score of three stars is based on the following logic. This book gets four stars as it's is a good anthological review of broader issues that have been in the marketplace for some time. It loses one star because that is all it is, a discussion, without analysis, ideas, alternatives or business applications the book discusses rather than raises issues for the future.

Ostensibly the big switch is between today's corporate computing which has islands of individual automation to what Carr calls the world wide computer - basically the programmable internet. Carr's attempt to coin a new phrase - world wide computer, is one of the things that does not work in this book. It feels contrived and while the internet is undergoing fundamental change, the attempt at rebranding is an unnecessary distraction.

Overall, this is a good book and should be considered as part of the overall future of economics and business genre rather than a discussion of IT or technology. Carr is an editor at heart and that shows through in this book. 80% of the book is reviews and discussions of the works of other people. I counted at least 30 other books and authors that I have read and Carr uses to support his basic argument.

The book's primary weakness is in its lack of attention to business issues, strategies and business recommendations. As an editor, it's understandable that Carr would not know first hand how to run a company. But I would have expected a more balanced analysis of the issues. Carr almost exclusively talks with companies that are vendors of this new solution - the supply side. He is a booster for Google - not a bad thing in itself - but something that leaves the book unbalanced. Without case examples, a discussion of business decisions, and alternatives - the book is too general to be something to organize my company's future around.

As an anthology about technology's influence on the future it's pretty good. The book does not deliver on groundbreaking new ideas that will drive strategy - particularly not for people who have followed the development of the internet. If you have read Gilder, Negroponte, Davenport and Harris, Peters, Lewis, Tapscott, among others, then you will recognize many of the ideas in this book.

Carr's book is in fact a prime example of the future world he describes where individuals garner attention, form a social group and then extract value from that group. Carr garnered attention with IT Doesn't Matter, used that to polarize the business community into IT supporters and detractors - creating even more attention, and finally extracting value from the group in the form of speaking engagements and this book. So Carr has made the big switch and it is from traditional media to a new attention driven economy. (Read Davenport and Beck's book Attention Economy if you want to understand more)

Chapter by Chapter Review

The book is divided in to two parts. The first uses historical analysis to build the ideas that the Internet is following the same developmental path as electric power did 100 years ago. This idea is one of Carr's obsessions and featured throughout his writing. The second section discusses the economic, social and other issues associated with the Internet becoming the platform and marketplace for commerce.

Chapter 1: Burden's Wheel lays out Carr's overall argument from an academic perspective. It starts with the historical position of water power, the precursor to electricity, and then explains conceptually what these different technologies mean. This is a clear statement and one that is important to the book. Carr points out the unique economic impact of general purpose technologies - the few technologies that are the basis for a multitude of other economic activity.

Chapter 2: The Inventor and His Clear is a historical account of the early days of electricity. Well researched, this chapter is good reading for the business history buff than one looking to understand the arguments Carr is making. The chapter focuses largely on the development and adoption of electric power. It points out that electric power had some false starts such as Edison's instance on local DC plants and that it needed the development of some additional technologies to take off. As an analogy to computing and the internet, these examples fit very neatly - almost too neatly into Carr's argument.

Chapter 3: Digital Millwork discusses the recent history of the computer. This is intended to give the reader the opportunity to connect the history of the electricity at the turn of the 20th century with the development of computing at the turn of the 21st century. It works to a point. Straight comparisons between client service computing and DC power generation among others are partially accurate, but incomplete. Carr sees bandwidth as the savior of computing much in the same way that the dynamo and Tesla's AC power turned electric plants into regional power companies.

This chapter communicates Carr's basic complaint with current information technology - at least in this book. His complain on page 56 and 57 is that IT costs too much for what it delivers. Latter he talks about excess capacity in servers and computing capacity. This basic cost economics argument does not take into account the value generated by the existence of the applications that run on those servers and the fact that at the time business leaders, like their grand fathers before them did not have another choice.

Chapter 4: Goodbye, Mr. Gates holds his explanation of the future world - a future of virtual computing where physical location and therefore device based software licensing no longer exists. In the chapter, Mr. Carr is late to the game. Grid computing has been a developing factor for more than 10 years and will accelerate as this book popularizes the idea. The comments in this chapter are not particularly new for the technology aware but they are almost unabashedly positive in favor of Google, something that will continue for the rest of the book

Chapter 5: The White City turns away from a continued development of the technical ideas of virtualization and grid computing and moves back into a historical discussion of how electricity changed people's lives and societies. Again Carr is providing information to set the reader up to make a comparison to what the switch to the Internet might be. His discussion of Insull and Ford are interesting if brief.

Part Two of the book takes a curious turn ad Carr finishes his arguments about the programmable internet and then seeks to systematically undermine the value of that environment on which he says the future is based. He offers few ideas or solutions, just criticism or more appropriately the criticism of others.

Chapter 6 World Wide Computer returns to the notion of what the unbridled possibilities of the programmable internet might be. This chapter concentrates on how wonderful this world will be for the individual with infinite information and computing power available to them. Carr provides a clear example of a Ford Mustang enthusiast's ability to create their own multi-media blog/website/advertising site as an example of how wonderful the world will be. This chapter is the utopian chapter where we all can benefit; Carr will destroy most of those notions in latter chapters.

Here is where Carr discusses the future of corporate computing; giving the topic all of four paragraphs p. 117-118. The basic idea is that today's IT will fade away in the face of `business units and individuals who will be able to control the processing of information directly."" For IT people, this is the end user computing argument. This is also the last word he makes on the subject of IT in the book.

Chapter 7: From Many to the Few is a discussion of the social impacts of a programmable internet where each runs their own personal business. Think Tom Peters and personal brand. This is the best chapter of the book and the most unusual Carr sets out to systematically point out the negative consequences of the assertions he makes in the previous chapters. Here he talks about the fact that fewer and fewer people will need to work in a global world of the programmable internet, that the utopia of equality and cottage industries envisioned by the web will not come to pass.

Chapter 8: The Great Unbundling talks about the move from mass markets to markets of one. The chapter also talks about the social implications of a web that connects like people creating a tribal and increasingly multi-polar world, rather than the world wide consciousness assumed to arise when education and communications levels increase.

Chapter 9 Fighting the Net discusses the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of free flowing information and the structural integrity of the net. This chapter again tears away at the foundation of the future that Carr lays out earlier. Normally in a book there would be public policy recommendations to address these points. They are not here giving this chapter more the feeling of journalism rather than analysis and insight.

Chapter 10 A Spider's Web addresses the personal privacy issues associated with the web and the realization that as Richard Hunter says ""we live in a world without secrets"". This chapter is a warning about the issues of privacy and what it means to do business where everything is recorded and tracked.

Chapter 11 iGod is the far out chapter talking about the fusion of human and machine consciousness. What is possible when the human brain can immediately access infinite information and the machine gains artificial intelligence? These are the questions raised but unaddressed in this chapter. In possibly setting up his next book, Carr provides a journalistic survey of the work that is being driven to bring man and machine together.",250

If you are familiar with Clojure, this book would be the best.

Dr Graham A Durant-Law CSC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World,Outstanding Publication on Network Analysis,"I've been using NodeXL , which is a plug-in for Excel, for some time now. It just keeps getting better and better, and has become one of my network analysis tools of choice and one of the tools we use in HyperEdge Pty Ltd . I therefore had no hesitation in pre-ordering ""Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World"" by Derek Hansen, Ben Shneiderman, and Marc Smith. Undoubtedly this is one of the better network analysis books on the market, and I unreservedly give it five stars. It is all the more better because it provides a comprehensive tutorial over several chapters on how to get the best from NodeXL.

The book has 15 chapters organised into three sections. The first three chapters serve as an introduction to social network analysis and social media like Twitter, Flickr and Facebook - none of which I use. I particularly like the chapter structure, which is consistent throughout the book. Each chapter provides key definitions and themes and finishes with both a ""Practitioner's Summary"" and a ""Researcher's Agenda"" - this means one can skim the book and quickly locate personal interests. Chapter 3 is elegant in its definitions and summary of key network analysis concepts. I particularly liked the idea of `network nirvana':

. every vertex is visible;
. every vertex's degree is countable;
. every edge can be followed from source to destination; and
. clusters and outliers are identifiable.

Section 2 is called ""NodeXL Tutorial: Learning By Doing"" and consists of four chapters. These chapters are, in my opinion, the heart of the book. They cover all the key elements of using NodeXL for network analysis, including layout, labelling and metrics. There is enough in the chapters to pique the interest of practitioners and academics alike, from beginner to advanced analyst. Again I like the elegance and accessibility for lay-people to some of the definitions. So much so that this text will become a standard inclusion in all my seminars and requires me to develop a NodeXL seminar and workshop!

The final section provides eight chapters, six of which are contributed by network researchers, and all of which provide case studies of network analysis using NodeXL. I found the chapter on email and lists of most interest, and commercially of most use, but from an academic perspective all the chapters are very interesting. The Twitter chapter was particularly enlightening, especially given I don't really see the value of Twitter - I'm rethinking that position at the moment! Similarly the Facebook chapter provided some interesting insights.

All in all this book was an excellent and easy read. Already my book is dog-eared and has lots of margin scribbles and highlights. I unreservedly give it five stars - five stars for readability and five stars for the learning by doing approach. It is a must-have book for every serious student and practitioner of network analysis. I can't wait for an e-book version, which I will buy immediately it is released.

Dr. Lee D. Carlson,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics),Excellent,"At least for the chapters that were studied by this reviewer, the authors of this book give an effective introduction to the mathematical theory used in cryptography at a level that can be approached by an undergraduate senior in mathematics. The field of cryptography is vast of course, and a book of this size could not capture it effectively. The topics of primary importance are represented however, and the authors do a fine job of motivating and explaining the needed concepts.
The authors give an elementary overview of elliptic curves over the complex numbers, and most importantly over finite fields whose characteristic is greater than 3. The case where the characteristic is equal to 2 is delegated to its own section. In discussing the arithmetic of elliptic curves over finite fields, the authors give a good motivation for Hasse's formula, which gives a bound for the number of points of the elliptic curve (over a finite field), but they do not go into the details of the proof. The Hasse formula is viewed in some texts as a ""Riemann Hypothesis"" for elliptic curves over finite fields, and was proven by Hasse in 1934. This reviewer has not studied Hasse's proof, but a contemporary proof relies on the Frobenius map and its separability, two notions that the authors do not apparently want to introduce at this level of book (however they do introduce the Frobenius map when discussing elliptic curves over F2). Separability is viewed in some texts in elliptic curves as more of a technical issue, which can be ignored at an elementary level. It arises when studying endomorphisms of elliptic curves of fields of non-zero characteristic, and involves defining rational functions. The Frobenius map is not separable, and this fact allows one to show that its degree is strictly greater than the number of points in its kernel. Taking the nth power of the Frobenius map and adding to it the endomorphism which simply multiplies elements by -1, one can show that the number of points of the elliptic curve is equal to the degree of this endomorphism. Just a few more arithmetical calculations establishes Hasse's estimate.
Some more of the highlights of this part of the book:
- The reminder that the fastest known algorithm to solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem takes p^1/2 steps for a finite field Fp (i.e. the algorithms therefore are not really better than ""black box"" algorithms).
- The brief historical discussion on public key cryptography.
- The motivational discussion for the Lenstra algorithm using simple calculations that leads to a failed attempt to find the reciprocal of an integer modulo p. This failure is used to explain the workings of the Lenstra elliptic curve factorization algorithm in a way that it is better appreciated by the reader.
- The discussion on the Frobenius map in the context of elliptic curves over F2 and its use in finding the number of points of an elliptic curve over a finite field.
- The motivational discussion for the use of distortion maps, due to the degeneracy of the Weil pairing. The distortion maps are used to define a modified Weyl pairing, which is proved to be non-degenerate.
Some omissions:
- Algorithms used to calculate the number of points of an elliptic curve over a finite field that are more efficient than brute-force counting or estimation using Hasse's formula.
- The proof that the torsion points of order m can be written as the product of two cyclic groups of order m. The authors apparently do not want to get into the notions of unramified and separable ""isogenies"" between elliptic curves and Galois extensions, both of which are used in the proof that they reference. Isogenies are mentioned in a footnote to the discussion on distortion maps, since the latter are isogenies.
- The proof verifying certain properties of divisors, namely that they are equal if the corresponding rational functions are constant multiples of each other, and that the degree of a divisor is zero if its sum is the zero element of the elliptic curve. The proofs were no doubt omitted due to their dependence on techniques from algebraic geometry.
- Quantum cryptography. This is discussed very briefly in the last chapter, but the subject is mature enough to be presented at the undergraduate level.
- Cryptography based on non-Abelian groups. One good example would be cryptography based on the mathematical theory of knots and braids (the braid group is non-Abelian), even though this approach is in its infancy at the present time, and in almost all cases shown to be highly vulnerable to attacks. It could have been included in the last chapter or possibly as a long exercise.
- Hyperelliptic curves are discussed very briefly in the last chapter, but a full-fledged presentation could be done in the book without missing the targeted audience. Hyperelliptic curves are also mentioned after the discussion of the MOV algorithm, wherein the authors allude to the use of Weil descent to transfer the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem to a discrete logarithm problem in a finite field F2^m when m is composite. The authors correctly don't want to elaborate on Weil descent in any more detail, since it requires a solid knowledge of field extensions and theory of algebraic varieties at a level that one obtains in a graduate course in algebraic geometry. Suffice it to say that the strategy of Weil descent involves finding a cover of the elliptic curve by a hyperelliptic curve that is defined over the extension of the ground field. This approach has been shown to be problematic for Koblitz curves, the latter of which are discussed in the book.

Darrell Teague,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Data Model Resource Book, Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling (Volume 3)",Excellent Treatment on Data Modeling for Durable Goods,"This is an excellent introductory to mid-level text on best-practices in enterprise data modeling.

Coming from a logistics/commerce consulting background, I can confirm that the recommendations are excellent.
The author clearly points out some anti-patterns that I have seen in many companies and, conversely, good models largely structured around ""durable goods"" businesses (selling, shipping and billing for material goods - though there are some considerations for services).

I would say this book is a ""must read"" for any business analyst, DBA, data-architect to prevent all-too-common errors seen in leading ""CRM"" and related systems that, given the acronym alone, clearly missed the boat on the concepts of sales/contact management systems.

It was only given four stars out of five as it does not really address more timely considerations of big-data, the diagrams could be more professional (and do not conform to any standard) and lastly the publisher seems to be squeezing every penny out of selling the CD and other volumes with no set discounts, etc.",1
Erik Gfesser,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Data Model Resource Book, Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling (Volume 3)",Well done third volume,"Incredibly well done follow-up to the first two volumes of Silverston's data model series (see my reviews for ""The Data Model Resource Book Volume 1 (Revised Edition): A Library of Universal Data Models for All Enterprises"" and ""The Data Model Resource Book Volume 2 (Revised Edition): A Library of Universal Data Models by Industry Types""). As discussed in the introduction to this book, while the first volume answered the question ""Where can we find a book showing a standard way to model common data model structures?"" and the second volume extended the template models presented in the first volume by adding additional data model constructs that are industry specific, this third volume answers the question ""How can we quickly extend and customize these models for our organization and our needs to quickly develop any data model with higher quality, even if it is specific to our enterprise?""

The patterns that Silverston and Agnew present are categorized into chapters entitled ""Setting Up Roles: What Parties Do"", ""Using Roles: How Parties Are Involved"", ""Hierarchies, Aggregations, and Peer-to-Peer Relationships: The Organization of Similar Data"", ""Types and Categories: The Classification of Data"", ""Status: The States of Data"", ""Contact Mechanisms: How to Get in Touch"", and ""Business Rules: How Things Should Work"". Each chapter is well laid out, similar in style to other books of this genre such as ""Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides. In this text, each pattern is laid out in its own section that answers the following questions: ""Why Do We Need This Pattern?"", ""How Does This Pattern Work?"", ""When Should This Pattern Be Used?"", and ""What Are the Weaknesses of the Pattern?""

In addition, an aspect of this book that this reviewer especially appreciates is a presentation of each pattern at different levels. While the data management industry habitually refers to conceptual, logical, and physical data models, because there are widely different views as to the definition and purpose behind each of these types of data models (this reviewer is all too familiar with this inconsistency from his consulting engagements), the authors devised four levels of patterns that span from the most static and the more specific (Level 1) to the most flexible and more ""generalized"" (Level 4). The authors explain that the two key purposes of a data model are (1) ""to illustrate and communicate information requirements, and (2) ""to provide a sound foundation for a database design"", and because these purposes can obviously be at odds with each other, depending on the stakeholders involved, care needs to be taken during the modeling process to determine appropriateness of approach.

While this reviewer offers no suggestions for alternative terminology, the decision of the authors to use the term ""generalization"" to describe the transformation of very specific data model structures to those which more flexibly support data requirements is interesting (especially given their explanation that they chose to do so since the object-oriented community uses the perhaps more intuitive term ""abstraction"" in a different way that has a different meaning) because this reviewer is well aware that software developers also use the term when referring to an object class superset that has object class ""specializations"". But despite this small matter, the consistent focus of the authors on the purpose of each level of data model presented throughout the text for each group of patterns (always discussing Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3, and sometimes discussing Level 4) is highly valued by this reviewer, especially when the authors discuss these levels in relationship to the Zachman Framework and other data model classification schemes.

This reviewer also enjoyed the last two chapters, entitled ""Using the Patterns"" and ""Socializing the Patterns"", in which the authors answer the questions ""How do I use, apply, and/or implement these patterns in my enterprise?"", ""What is an appropriate balance between requiring adherence to the patterns and allowing them to be used completely optionally and used if and when they are helpful to the modeler/designer?"", ""How do you get your enterprise and various people in the enterprise to adopt these patterns?"", and ""What types of policies or principles regarding use of the patterns would be most appropriate to get the most benefit from these patterns?""

In the first of these last two chapters (Chapter 9), the authors demonstrate how the patterns can be used to create different data models that meet different needs, using the different levels of patterns as interchangeable components and combining them to solve common data modeling challenges for circumstances surrounding the building of prototyping and scoping data models, application data models, enterprise data models, data warehouse data models, and master data management (MDM) data models. In the list of additional considerations when using generalized patterns at the end of this chapter, this reviewer appreciates their remark that ""generalized structures move the change process from the typical 'data architect to DBA to developer to tester' process to a data change process, and often organizations have no formal process for data change like they have for application change"" and that ""this can be addressed with organizational commitment to flexible data modeling structures"", especially because this reviewer experienced firsthand the impact on culture when implementing database change management processes at his last two clients.

Chapter 10 addresses getting these patterns accepted and used appropriately, discussing in detail many of the objections that one might face in the workplace as well as what the authors see as key to success in this regard: (1) understand motivations and work toward meeting them, (2) develop a clear, common, compelling vision, (3) develop trust, and (4) manage conflict effectively. In addition to understanding the motivations of others, the authors also indicate that understanding one's own motivations is also important. While this last chapter is focused on the data model patterns discussed throughout the text, in the opinion of this reviewer the psychological aspects discussed are applicable to a much broader context in the workplace, and it can only help the industry if more authors choose to address such matters. Well recommended book to all data architects and other data management professionals.",3
Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Data Model Resource Book, Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling (Volume 3)",Best kept secret to flexible DB solution,"I'm helping to build a custom order entry and accounting solution for our company. As we were gathering requirements in the early phases we knew up front that the database underneath the software would be the foundation and backbone of the entire system. This wan't an issue we would compromise on. I've been a developer and business analyst for years and I know how much it costs to work around poorly designed data structures. I've seen developers quit over a poorly designed database because they knew how much pain and suffering they would have to endure to code around it. A solid database turns software maintenance and reporting into manageable tasks. Developers need to understand this: the structure of the data in the database is (and should be) very different from the structure of data in forms and fields in applications. You need to understand the relationship between the data model (intangible), the physical model (real schema), and the human readable projections (pretty much all the users are concerned with). This book will help you do this. Also, the CD that is available for purchase separately from the book is worth it's weight in gold.",2
Erik Gfesser,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Data Model Resource Book, Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling (Volume 3)",Great reference for the enterprise data architect,"It is worth repeating what this reviewer indicated in his review of the second volume in this series of three texts on data models: although there are quite a few positive reviews for this series, there are also a nontrivial number of dissenters as well, who cite use of Barker's notation rather than Crow's Foot notation (i.e. Information Engineering notation) as well as unexpected contents within the accompanying CD. When first introduced to Richard Barker's ""Entity Relationship Modeling"" text during graduate school, this reviewer does admit that becoming familiar with his notation did take some, but all told it does not deviate significantly from Crow's Foot, and after a short amount of time the reader will actually notice some advantages in using it, one of which is the reduced space that substantive models need to consume. Sure, additional information not available with the CD can be purchased on Silverston's companion web site at Wiley, but it really is not necessary. Not only are these downloads not necessary, these may detract from the process of understanding the material that Silverston is attempting to present. And Silverston presents very well.

Silverston explains in this volume that clients have inquired on numerous occasions where they can find texts showing standard ways to model data constructs, and ""based on numerous experiences of using template or 'universal data models' and customizing them for various enterprises, we have concluded that usually more than 50 percent of the data model (corporate or logical) consists of common constructs that are applicable to most organizations, another 25 percent of the model is industry specific, and on average about 25 percent of the enterprise's data model is specific to that organization. Of course, as John Zachman indicates in the second volume, ""Let's get pragmatic. Starting with a universal data model does not absolve anyone of the responsibility of knowing his or her own enterprise intimately, at even an excruciating level of detail! Nor does it absolve anyone from the responsibility of learning how to build data models! What you have to do is start with the universal model, and then understanding data modeling and understanding your own enterprise, make the necessary modifications to make the universal model your own.""

Barker's notation is presented along with basic modeling in the introduction to this text, after which the author presents chapters on modeling people and organizations, products, ordering products, shipments, work effort, invoicing, accounting and budgeting, and human resources. Five chapters on data warehousing modeling follow, including explanations on how to create the data warehouse data model from the enterprise data model, as well as star schema designs for sales analysis, human resources, inventory management analysis, purchase order analysis, shipment analysis, work effort analysis, and financial analysis. When determining which of the three volumes you might purchase, be aware that there is some overlap between the volumes. For example, the second volume in this series contains models for products and people and organizations. In respect to these subject areas, however, the second volume in this series presents this information in respect to specific industries, while this first volume discusses them in a manner universal to all industries, significantly expanding upon any overlapping areas of the second volume while at the same time remaining industry neutral. Remember though that all of these models are to be used simply as input to your enterprise modeling efforts rather than as end states in themselves.

This reviewer recommends this text just as wholeheartedly as the second volume in this series. It can never hurt to get additional insight from other industry practitioners, and compared to other available resources the cost of this text is trivial. Note also that the second volume in this series refers to this volume in a number of different areas, so it makes sense to acquire these two volumes together.",3
Rainy Day,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Data Model Resource Book, Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling (Volume 3)",Use together with Volume 2,"I've purchased numerous modeling books over the years, and this is by far the best. I highly recommend purchasing together with Volume 2 which has specialization of the models by industry type; I also purchased book 3 and they really worked well as a set. One criticism people have had is that the physical implementations require an expensive add on purchase. But check out the referenced example downloads as they include all of the database scripts for implementing parties and party roles, which is arguably the most complex part of the models. The sample scripts together with the book's included Logical Model Entities and Attributes Appendix provided enough detail for me to create a base physical model. Anyway, the sample scripts create a schema with migrating primary keys, which is not the way I wanted my physical model for use with Hibernate, so the purchased scripts would have been only of marginal value. Microsoft use to include a version of the scripts with SQL Server, but using my MSDN account I downloaded and installed the referenced version exactly as described in the Microsoft documentation, and the required final install sub folder as far as I could tell was missing, in case anyone else goes to look for it.

As to the level of ""detail"" provided in the models, refer to Volume 3 as to strategies for choosing right level of generalization. Personally, I really appreciated the provided detail.",3
Piers C.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Data Model Resource Book, Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling (Volume 3)",Required reference for enterprise database developers,"Relatively few technical books hold their value over time, but this is one of them. This volume describes example data models for areas of interest to most businesses: organization, products, ordering, shipping, work effort, invoicing, accounting and HR. The first two thirds of the book cover operational systems, and the final third addresses star schemas for data warehouses. The intent is to provide a starting point to help designers faced with developing new data models for businesses, perhaps in an area they are not already familiar with: indeed the Apache OFBiz ERP project has been built based on the models in this book. The book uses a special visual notation to present the entity-relationship models, which include a large number of optional subtypes, but it is straightforward to understand. An appendix provides a complete list of example entitiy attributes, but it may come as a surprise there are only fragments of DDL provided on the enclosed CD: the rest of the DDL is available on a separate CD from Wiley priced at $350. Alternately the models can be licenced for Embarcadero's ER/Studio, or it may be worthwhile looking at the Visio models created by the OFBiz project. In any case these are example models that try to address what is similar between many businesses, but they are not turnkey solutions that will meet all the needs of any given business.

My impression is that, given so many off-the-shelf business solutions are already available, the number of people building new data models from scratch is limited, and therefore so is the core audience of this book. Many more are faced with customizing or extending existing systems, and for them this is an interesting reference of best practices to be consulted for ideas when considering changes.",3
Thomas E.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Data Model Resource Book, Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling (Volume 3)",Good but repeats parts from 1 and 2,"The Data Model Resource Book (3) is a book about database patterns which can be used in many situations. If you are just interested in modeling something and want to check if there is a way to improve your model, but also if you just want to learn something about data modeling concepts.

The chapters are always structured in a way that the patterns start of with the easiest (to understand) and also strictest way to model a problem and finish with very flexible patterns.

I would say that the book is a good investment, but the first and second book already include a lot of the information that is written in the third part. That means if you don't already have the first and second part of the series it would be better to start with them.",1

Robert P. Hoeting,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Data Model Resource Book, Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling (Volume 3)",A Comprehensive Study of Key Data Model Patterns,"Unlike the world of Object Oriented programming, there are very few pattern books devoted to data modeling. This is unfortunate because most business applications suffer from over-specialization & inflexibility in the data model, where change is very expensive. The few data model patterns books that do exist do not explore the depths of subject to the extent that this book does.

Based on their many years of experience, Silverston & Agnew chose to focus on the most common areas of interest (Parties, Roles, Relationships, Statuses, Classifications, Contact Mechanisms, & Rules) and offer a set of data model pattens for each. Each area has a set of ""pattern levels"" ranging from specific to general, listing benefits, drawbacks, & usage guidelines for each. The modeler can choose which pattern level best suites the enterprise based on perceived needs.

This book can be thought of as the ""gang of four"" book for data modeling. I would recommend this book for anyone engaging in any form of data modeling. You may not use the exact patterns, but it will at least serve as a catalyst for future thought.",16
C. Allen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Data Model Resource Book, Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling (Volume 3)",An Essential Resource for the Serious Data Modeler,"""Universal Patterns for Data Modeling"" is the third volume in The Model Resource Book series.

In ""Universal Patterns"", authors and data modeling experts Len Silverston and Paul Agnew examine the recurring patterns that are essential for architects to understand in building and maintaining enterprise data models. The book covers key patterns, including those for party, role, hierarchy, classification, status, communications, and business rules.

Modeling methodology guides sometimes are overly prescriptive. However, a strength of the Silverston/Agnew book is that it recognizes that different organizations have different requirements. Each pattern is examined across four ""levels."" A level represents the degree of generality or specificity with which the particular pattern is implemented. Thus, there is no underlying ""one-size-fits-all"" assumption, but rather a framework for thinking about the relative tradeoffs in choosing the level of generality to match given business requirements.

Anyone with a serious interest in data modeling should have all three volumes on their bookshelf. However, Volumme 3, ""Universal Patterns"" is definitely the volume to start with if you have not already bought Volumes 1 and 2. I've joked with Len and Paul that Volume 3, is the ""prequel."" For those who are new to this series, start with Volume 3, then go on to Vol. 1 and 2.",9

The book was a very concise useful source for the implementation of both logical, and subsequently physical data models. Some people may criticize so called generalities, but ""generalities"" are a subjective concept. I have personally have seen much more generic type models that where nowhere near as useful as the models in the Data model resource book.
The bottom line is that these models work in the real world as a jump-start for data projects. If you don't want to get caught in the mire of data modeling, buy this book.",2

Michael Tozer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Data Model Resource Book, Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling (Volume 3)",Well Done!,"Len Silverston's book on Universal Data Models, ""The Data Model Resource Book: Volume 1"" is generally well done, and important. The text presents numerous Universal Data Models that can be employed in the design and development of logical data models in support of relational database designs in various industries. Such Universal Data Models can certainly be an aid in furthering the important goal of effective logical data modeling. However, the book is certainly no panacea. Nor, apparently, was it intended to be.

By way of background, I ought to share that I initially became involved in the disciplines of logical data modeling and relational database design way back in 1984. Yes, I was doing it before it was ""cool"". In my own experience, I benefited greatly from the ""Extended Relational Analysis"" methodology promulgated by Relational Systems Design of suburban Detroit. And yet, it was only eight or nine years ago that I came to be exposed to this notion of Universal Data Models, through work with the IBM Financial Services Models. And, at first, I must admit that my previous training and experience tended to make me want to resist such a thing as a Universal Data Model. However, over several years of working with these universal models successfully on numerous projects, I, too, came to be a ""believer"".

This first volume of Len Silverston's book does a fine job of representing the general sense of the universal models. One does get a sense, in carefully reading the text, that there might have been a good deal of copying and pasting going in the assembling of the text. And that may be regrettable. But, it is also understandable in light of the fact that the author is also evidently a practicioner, naturally constrained more than a bit in terms of time.

This volume deals with universal models of key concepts like Party, Product, and Contact Mechanism. And the reasoning behind these universal models presented within the corpus of the text is very worthwhile. In fact, I wish that I might have read this book and series years ago, when I first began working with such models. Having finished the first volume, I have ordered, purchased, and received the second volume, which deals with industry specific models. What better complement can we really offer to the author and publisher of this important work? Well done!",3

I found the book to be inconsistent. It seems the editors did a poor job of review. Particularly confusing is Appendix A. Many of the fields there don't appear any where in the models; they suddenly pop out there.

Further, the author leaves a lot of unanswered questions. They lightly touch on certain topics and then completely ignore them. They also discuss topics that quite arcane and overlook things that are required by most organizations.

Finally, the CD is absolutely useless. I'm not sure why it's even included. Apparently, if you want the CD with the DDL, it's sold separately.

This book is good only as an overview of how certain models can be created, but it's not good enough to be used as a guide to implement these models.",2

Doug Dew,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Data Model Resource Book, Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling (Volume 3)","Somewhat useful, but disappointing","Summary:
These books contain some useful information, but overall are disappointing. I would recommend buying the books, but I wouldn't recommend believing that these books are going to help you achieve a data modeling quick start.
The bad stuff:
The models in the books are so generic and abstract that they cannot be considered ""ready-to-use"" in any sense. You will almost certainly have to make some significant adjustments.
Also, these books take a long time getting to the point. Consider that a discussion of physical database design isn't provided until chapter 15 of the book. Who would want to read a cookbook, data or otherwise, and have to suffer through 14 chapters of abstractions before finally getting around to talking about cooking in chapter 15? Not me.
Worse, once in chapter 15, the reader discovers that the author is quick to drop some of his preachy notions of supertypes/subtypes of chapters 1 - 14 as soon as the author has to actually do something real with a plain ol' non-polymorphic physical design. There's nothing wrong with what the author presents in chapter 15. It is sound. However, given the designs of chapter 15, why force the reader to suffer through a bunch of preaching about supertypes and subtypes in chapters 1 - 14? Let's face it, supertypes and subtypes are just wishful thinking in RDBMS land.
The books seem to be way too verbose. Too many pages are dedicated to fluff that does little more than state common sense. Anybody accustomed to reading dense technical material will probably be a little bit frustrated when reading these books, as these books are anything but dense. While reading these books there's always the aggravating feeling of ""when are we going to get to the point?"" and ""where's the useful stuff?""
The good stuff:
The models in the books are useful for providing suggestions of entities/attributes/relationships to consider when modeling data. In other words, the models may be used as a sort of second check during modeling work to make sure that potentially important entities/attributes/relationships haven't been overlooked.",18

Lenny and I worked together with Johnny Glogower on quantum phase and time operators at Cornell in 1964 .Lenny's densely mathematical book is not a popular book. It is incomprehensible to the general reader and it is not easy going for the professional theoretical physicist not in the sub-field. However, it has moments of great clarity and if it is wrong, as George Chapline thinks, it is brilliantly wrong. Certainly pieces of Lenny's thesis will survive. So, to really see what the book is about, it's best to read the end of the book first and then go back to the beginning. Lenny emphasizes the key role on nonlocality (e.g. nonlocality of gravity energy?) in black hole complementarity.

""In order to reconcile the equivalence principle with the rules of quantum mechanics the rules of locality must be massively modified.""

I like the idea of the blackhole as a string since I already published in 1974 the explanation of the Regge slope alpha' (for strings)

J ~ alpha'E^2

alpha' ~ (1Gev)^-2

as rotating Kerr black hole Wheeler ""micro with effective strong gravity G* ~ 10^40G in Herbert Frohlich's ""Collective Phenomena"". Indeed, that's why Abdus Salam invited me to ICTP Trieste, Italy 1973-74 (e.g. contact Jagdish Mehra).

What will survive is the IR/UV duality. What about LIF/LNIF complementarity? Intriguing. What is completely missing in Lenny's theory is Vacuum ODLRO. For example, Lenny never considers a Bose-Einstein condensate in the vacuum in which there is a macroscopic eigenvalue of the first reduced density matrix. All eigenvalues must be less than 1 in Lenny's theory. Second, Lenny used a positive energy density to derive some of his key results when in fact negative zero point energy density would describe dark matter. Third, Lenny's ADS model has the wrong sign of the actually observed small post-inflation cosmological constant. How fatal this is I do not know yet. Perhaps he analytically continues to the DS model? That is ADS is ""dark matter"" with negative zero point energy density and positive pressure. DS is ""dark energy"" with positive zero point energy density and negative pressure. Furthermore, Lenny's equation for p the power of t in the FRW scale factor a(t) ~ t^p breaks down in the most important case, i.e. p -> infinity when w -> -1, which is the case for zero point energy. One nice idea is that the D3 brane of M-theory is the kind of 3+1 space-time we live in with the 6 extra space-time dimensions as ""scalar fields"". This fits well with Gennady Shipov's torsion field theory extension of 1915 GR. Indeed, if we interpret these scalar fields as vacuum ODLRO Higgs-Goldstone fields associated with the local gauging of the Lorentz group O(1,3) then the vacuum order parameter space is SU(2)xSU(2) consistent with the Hedgehog anomaly centered at Sun seen in the TWO NASA Pioneer Space Probes where a_g = - cH(t). All stars may have this property, i.e. part of stellar formation? Maybe even galaxies have it? That is vacuum ODLRO topological defects as seeds for early galaxy formation explaining galactic halos as well?

He opens up with the math of black holes in different coordinate representations. But you need to remember (or look up) your high school logarithms and the trigonometry formula for the tangent of the half-angle to show from eqs (1.1.2) to (1.1.4) that a signal from the black hole surface horizon never reaches the distant observers. The Penrose diagram makes that instantly obvious of course.

Comment 1

Lenny: ""The paradox was discovered by Jacob Bekenstein and turned into a serious crisis by Stephen Hawking. ... Bekenstein realized that if the second law of thermodynamics was not to be violated in the presence of a black hole, the black hole must possess an intrinsic entropy. ... How and why a classical solution of field equations should be endowed with thermodynamical attributes has remained obscure.""

Jack: The black hole is a property of Einstein's vacuum equation

Ruv = 0

However, this equation is a c-number emergent field theory from vacuum ODLRO. George Chapline, Jr and I have both arrived at this general idea quite independently. Let the vacuum ODLRO order parameter be

psi = |psi|e^iargpsi

suppress internal symmetry indices, but think of SU(2)hypercharge that has a neutral VEV in the standard model (evidence from NASA Pioneer anomaly a_g = -cH(t) as a hedgehog topological defect centered at Sun).

Let the Einstein-Cartan 1-form be

e = 1 + B

My ansatz is

B = (hG/c^3)^1/2d(argtheta)

with ""string"" branch cuts in argtheta

Therefore, there is no gravity and inertia when h -> 0 and c -> infinity even when G =/= 0. There is still some residual ""normal fluid"" fluctuations around the stiff vacuum order parameter psi that obeys the rules of micro-quantum theory as given by Lenny. The ratio of normal to superfluid obviously has a temperature parameter T. Therefore, Lenny's question is answered.

Comment 2

Lenny: ""Eventually the black hole must completely evaporate. Hawking then raised the question of what becomes of the quantum correlations between matter outside the black hole and matter that disappears behind the horizon. ... Hawking then made arguments that there is no way, consistent with causality, for the correlations to be carried by the outgoing evaporation products.""

Jack: So much the worse for causality, which here means no space-like influences outside the local light cones. Bell's theorem shows that such space-like influences are needed and they are locally random in micro-quantum theory consistent with the blackbody radiation.

Lenny: ""Thus, according to Hawking, the existence of black holes inevitably causes a loss of quantum coherence and breakdown of one of the basic principles of quantum mechanics - the evolution of pure states into pure states.""

Jack: So much the worse for micro-quantum mechanics. It's time to slaughter that Sacred Cow. Global special relativity of 1905 is violated by the necessity of gravity and inertia in local general relativity of 1915 where it is relegated to a purely local tangent space by the equivalence principle. In the same way micro-quantum mechanics is not complete, but merely corresponds to nonlocally entangled small fluctuations about the stiff macro-quantum vacuum ODLRO coherent order parameter that provides the local fabric of space-time via

B = (hG/c^3)^1/2d(argVacuum ODLRO).

Lenny: ""Hawking further argued that once the loss of quantum coherence is permitted in black hole evaporation, it becomes compulsory in all processes involving the Planck scale. The world would behave as if it were in a noisy environment which continuously leads to a loss of coherence. The trouble with this is that there is no known way to destroy coherence without at the same time violating energy conservation by heating the world.""

Jack: I need to see the math of the above argument. Why does not the expansion of the universe cool down this alleged heating effect? Also total energy is not necessarily conserved in curved space-time because of the breakdown of time translation symmetry. Presumably the book will explain this argument in more detail. Lenny wants to hold on to micro-quantum unitarity at all costs and I think this is the basic error in his thesis, but I could be wrong. The macro-quantum vacuum ODLRO order parameter does not obey a unitary time evolution. You cannot think of |psi|^2 as a Born quantum probability density like you can for micro-quantum wave functions.

Indeed the space integral of |psi(x)|^2 need not be a constant of the motion at all. For example, you have a pot of superfluid helium at almost T = 0 at t = 0 and then you slowly heat it. As you heat the superfluid it turns to normal fluid completely disappearing at the lambda point. In the case of vacuum ODLRO the ""normal fluid"" is the dark energy!

Comment 3
Lenny's Chapter 1 implicitly clearly shows why Hal Puthoff's PV alternative to the black hole is not a useful theory for metric engineering the fabric of space-time to reach the stars and other galaxies in a short time through wormholes held open by dark energy. Hal uses isotropic coordinates inside the event horizon where they are not appropriate. He says he can do that because his exponential metric does not have an event horizon. But in that case his solution does not obey Einstein's vacuum GR equation Ruv = 0. Therefore, PV theory conflicts with GR. Indeed, PV theory is not consistent with Diff(4) tensors and therefore, it violates the equivalence principle. In spite of that Hal Puthoff claims he is not offering a theory different from GR but only an ""engineer's"" way to do it. This, of course, is self-contradictory. Note that in George Chapline's ""dark star"" theory there is dark energy behind the event horizon, i.e. not Ruv = 0, but the same equation I use

Guv + /\zpfguv = 0

We do seem to need Gennady Shipov's torsion field beyond 1915 GR to allow

/\zpf^,v =/= 0 at the event horizon boundary because the Bianchi identities without torsion demand /\zpf^,v = 0.

GIS Trainer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Modeling Our World: The ESRI Guide to Geodatabase Concepts,Modeling GIS,When you think of GIS and understand how it functions people tend to look at the tools (aka toys) but the Geodatabase concepts really get to the foundation of what you need to get started. Of course it is boring compared to the tools but Zeiler and company do a good job here communicating graphically and in words the reality we see in the world and make a good transition to the abstractions of the geodatabase. The LIDAR section was great and this book is a good reference to have when you are working with various data models. It would have been five stars but in the raster section they should have mentioned gps photographs. With several gps cameras on the market the author simply says that photographs do not have a spatial reference.,11
Watch the Dot,4.0 out of 5 stars,Modeling Our World: The ESRI Guide to Geodatabase Concepts,"Broad and informative, but occasional readability issues","Modeling Our World is likely the most authoritative text currently available about geodatabases. The sheer amount of information here and breadth of topics covered make it an excellent reference for anyone in the GIS field. Given its publication date of 2010 I was concerned the text would be out of date, but it turns out that's not the case. This is strictly a reference book. There are no exercises requiring a certain edition of ArcGIS software to complete, nor are there any how-to guides with screenshots explaining how to perform a task. The text simply discusses the overarching concepts in geodatabases. Projections, versioning, linear referencing, geocoding...the ideas behind all of these and more will not change, even when the software does. Perhaps the final chapter, which includes some Python code, will become (or maybe already is) outdated, but even then it would only affect 4 pages and still wouldn't change the fact you have to import a module or specify a workspace.

With that being said, the book's not perfect. Chapter reviews only appear at the end of the longest chapters, but having these at the end of every chapter would be better. A glossary would also be helpful considering how much is covered here, but there isn't one. Including 3 or 4 review questions about the major themes at the end of a chapter would help readers retain information, but there aren't any. Typos are fairly common, and sometimes the wording is confusing, requiring the reader to review a sentence multiple times to truly understand what the author is trying to convey.

For an example of the wording issue, see the first sentence of page 208:

""You use mosaic methods in a mosaic dataset to control what raster data is presented each time a mosaic (from the mosaic dataset) is displayed.""

It's not that passages like this have any kind of technical error, it's that in the interest of being as precise as possible by eliminating pronouns and condensing everything into single sentences they've become unnecessarily hard to read.

Still, none of this negates the fact that overall the book is informative and useful. Full-color charts, diagrams, and tables appear throughout it. It's well organized, and outside of ESRI's online help pages you're unlikely to find anything on geodatabases this thorough. Modeling Our World explores the possibilities of ArcGIS and yet still only begins to scratch the surface - the numerous analyst extensions and spatial statistics barely noted here. The concepts aren't limited to a single version of the software, and given how it discusses them this book would likely be useful to users of other GIS software as well.",1
penguinboy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Modeling Our World: The ESRI Guide to Geodatabase Concepts,"High-level concepts, not much meat.","I partly question the purpose of a book like this. In my experience with learning GIS, by far the most effective way to learn is by doing. This book is not about doing. As the title suggests, it is about concepts only, and offers no practical exercises. I find that reading GIS theory gets me nowhere. Maybe it's because I'm a spatial thinker, one of the reasons I love GIS. At any rate, this isn't a book for self-teachers, but it might help with the basics if you are taking a class with a good teacher.

Bottom line: If I could do it all over, I'd skip this one.",2

Let's Compare Options Preptorial,5.0 out of 5 stars,Inside Windows Debugging (Developer Reference),"Outstanding Breadth and Depth, and not just for security","Since most of the core/kernel elements of Windows haven't changed since NT in the late 80's, most of the ""new"" stuff is in the form of API's. Soulami assumes a basic working knowledge of C/C++ or C#, but doesn't start at such a high level that you get lost in either the debugger or the tracer. This book is REALLY up to date on windows, and will catch you up even if you are still working on an NT base.

Chapters include: 1. How to develop software for Windows 2. Getting started (debugging for fun and profit section) 3. How debuggers work (pretty basic but very complete, covers both User and Kernel modes) 4. Postmortem Debugging (JIT vs. dump techniques. Goes much deeper than the day to day systems engineer will usually go) 5. Beyond the Basics (the real meat of the book-- awesome-- data vs. code breakpoints, scripts, etc.) 6. Code analysis tools (fair to C/++ and sharp, with many actual/not just pseudo/ code examples that are well thought out and RUN); 7. Expert Debugging Tricks (we finally get to the fun and profit piece-- many techniques that are effective but unusual, and probably wouldn't be attempted by the usual coder without this book's help on avoiding potholes); 8 and 9 are a whole collection of very cool ""scenarios"" covering all the NIGHTMARES created by threads and multiprocessors such as race conditions, deadlocks, stack/heap and access problems, etc. These two chapters are worth the price of the whole book; 10 gets into the console subsystem and concludes this section.

Section two (about 120 pages) switches themes with three chapters about Xperf. In short, if you try to run traces as you develop your software using just ETW (event tracing for Windows), you'll soon get overwhelmed and give it up. This means you're losing one of the best ""secret sauces"" of the Windows 7 SDK (a way to integrate what's already been perfected, instead of reinventing every wheel, with proven code connected with an already debugged ETW web). The way to tap into that secret sauce IS Xperf.

The two excellent appendices give user and kernel debug quick start examples that make this book as much as a reference and tutorial as a step by step learning guide.

Beyond debugging, there is a LOT of information on how to develop superior software USING the debugger, not for debugging, but for software analysis, code vs. operating system, security, and development cycle issues like static vs. runtime analysis.

Erik Gfesser,5.0 out of 5 stars,HBase: The Definitive Guide: Random Access to Your Planet-Size Data,"Wide scope and deep coverage by the ""Ask Tom"" of HBase","This text is amongst the few books I have read in my career which not only serves as a great introduction to a technology, but also provides significant content for both advanced users and those who wish to understand what is under the covers in order to understand both benefits and drawbacks before making a decision in terms of adoption. While I was not familiar with the author, Lars George, until reading this text, the foreward to what the author shares here offers some street cred. ""Of all those who have contributed to HBase over the years, it is poetic justice that Lars is the one to write this book. Lars was always dogging HBase contributors that the documentation needed to be better if we hoped to gain broader adoption. Everyone agreed, nodded their heads in ascent, amen'd, and went back to coding. So Lars started writing critical how-tos and architectural descriptions inbetween jobs and his intra-European travels as unofficial HBase European ambassador. His Lineland blogs on HBase gave the best description, outside of the source, of how HBase worked, and at a few critical junctures, carried the community across awkward transitions (e.g. an important blog explained the labyrinthian HBase build during the brief period we thought an Ivy-based build to be a 'good idea'). His luscious diagrams were poached by one and all wherever an HBase presentation was given.""

At least one other reviewer here commented that it was hard for them to understand the purpose of this book, because of its broad scope. But in my opinion its broad scope is what makes it so valuable, at least to the architect. The potential reader just needs to keep in mind that they need to understand what they wish to gain from reading a text on HBase. For example, if the potential reader simply wants to understand how to use the APIs that HBase provides, there may be no need to understand HBase architecture and so the chapters that the author provides on related material may not be applicable at the outset. It is difficult to argue for a sequential reading of this text from beginning to end, although the potential reader also needs to keep in mind the importance of minimal understanding of the programmatic connections with the architecture, in which case a cursory overview of some of the more advanced material is highly recommended. In contrast, as an architect who wants to understand as many of the benefits, drawbacks, and implementation details as possible, especially when considering my extensive experience with relational databases such as Oracle, I appreciate all of the detail that George has to offer here, and would not have it any other way. While I have not yet reviewed his blog yet to any great extent, based on his street cred and the abundance of material in this book, I do not think it is a stretch to akin him to Tom Kyte of ""Ask Tom"" fame within the Oracle space.

After an introduction that provides discussions on big data, column-oriented databases, problems with relational database systems, nonrelational database systems, and an HBase architectural overview (all within Chapter 1), George quickly moves forward to a chapter on HBase installation (Chapter 2), followed by discussions of native Java APIs (Chapters 3, 4, and 5), available clients (Chapter 6), and integration with Hadoop's MapReduce framework (Chapter 7). The remainder of the text delves into more advanced topics, beginning with HBase architecture (Chapter 8), followed by design topics critical to taking full advantage of HBase architecture (Chapter 9), as well as discussions on cluster monitoring (Chapter 10), performance tuning (chapter 11), and cluster administration (chapter 12). As a general rule, George does a great job at introducing topics in an order that makes sense without frequently referring to chapters later in the book, which is a pet peeve of mine with other technical books. One of the many aspects I especially appreciated about this text is that even in chapters that cover content that might be seen as high-level content by other architects, George is not afraid to get down in the trenches at the programmatic level, even in the preface to the book, in which the author explains how to build the examples that he provides in his Git repository.

Please be aware that even though the author discusses features such as coprocessors that have been included in subsequent releases (at the time of writing this review, version 0.92.1 has been made available as a stable release), the author does make note in Chapter 2 that ""the current version of HBase will only run on Hadoop 0.20.x. It will not run on Hadoop 0.21.x (nor 0.22.x) as of this writing. HBase may lose data in a catastrophic event unless it is running on an HDFS that has durable sync support. Hadoop 0.20.2 and Hadoop 0.20.203.0 do not have this support. Currently, only the branch-0.20-append branch has this attribute. No official releases have been made from this branch up to now, so you will have to build your own Hadoop from the tip of this branch."" The author does bring up the fact that Cloudera's CDH3 has already applied the patches associated with durable sync, if building Hadoop is not your cup of tea, but keep in mind that Cloudera as of less than two weeks ago has already released CDH4 Beta 2. Anyone interested in HBase needs to keep in mind that this space is moving along quickly, so plan to get started with this book and move forward with the abundant material that is increasingly being made available online. That said, George provides a wealth of knowledge that I do not expect to be surpassed at any time in the foreseeable future by any other publication.",6

The Author's point is that with most business models in the future the Cathedral method (read Microsoft) will not be able to compete with the Bazaar method (read Linux). In the Cathedral method the programmers must be hired, the bazaar method the hackers are attracted to a problem, become more dedicated, revisions and bugs are handled at internet speed. The author tells of many real-life business experiences companies have had adopting the open source method. The middle of the book explains the hacker ethic and how the hacker community operates. The reader learns the true meaning of ""hacker"" v.s. ""cracker"" and the true meaning of free software. The author predicts that open source software will make deep in-roads into the Fortune-500 companies. That their investments in hardware and records may be dependent on one software company's decision to continue supporting that software revision is the problem. Open source software would provide a proliferation of hacker communities willing to constantly update older software. The author appears to know his stuff and progressively throughout the book the author lets it leak out that he is one of the hacker community and is a player/spokesman in this software battle I found this book a real eye-opener, can Microsoft's workforce continue to support software like Windows 2000 with 60 million lines of code, as opposed to Linux taking advantage of a worldwide army of hackers reporting bugs, writing patches, and keeping hardware drivers updated. Time will tell.

This book was enough to prompt this reader to obtain a copy of Linux just in case..",1
Jonathan Pepin,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Cathedral & the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary,good history book,"Ahah seriously, I enjoyed reading it. It was really nice to read about how the tech world today is like it is, and where it comes from, and read about the creation of linux, and mozilla, etc.
It also explains perfectly the difference between opensource and proprietary software. First why open source simply exists, what's it forces and advantages, and then explains how it can make money and be that attractive. And how some open source project can become better than softwares made by multi-billion companies.
A good read to get to know better the industry :)",1
V. Vasiliadis,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Cathedral & the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary,For those who question why open source makes sense,"Eric Raymond presents a coherent and well-supported case that explains why open source makes commercial sense. Putting aside the ""religious"" fervor of some of his arguments, the logic on why the open source movement can spawn successful businesses is irrefutable. Read it and you will understand why traditional (proprietary) software business models have become a dying breed. I would rate the book a ""5"" but for some parts where the text becomes somewhat convoluted and repetitive. Overall, a must-read for anyone involved in software development.",1
Benjamin Rossen,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Cathedral & the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary,"A classic with much to offer, but flawed.","Eric Raymond is widely regarded as the anthropologist of the hacker community. This is Eric Raymond's revised classic with some new material. It is the first comprehensive commentary on the sociology of the Open Source community, and recommended reading for anyone doing business in software development, or running a business that depends on software and the Internet.

Like many of Eric Raymond's colleagues and fellow Geeks, he is clearly a brilliant individual, carried forward by focused effort and imagination. And like many talented people, he is an autodidact; self taught bar some courses in philosophy and mathematics. This is not a criticism. Raymond's career, publications and contribution show amply the intellectual qualities he possesses. However, his lack of training in social, economic and cultural science shows. And, as an insider (he is one of the original tribe of hackers) he is not the best person to make a disinterested commentary on the hacker community.

Great hackers, he tells us, are humble people. A more critical observer would have analyzed the comparative payoffs of styles showing why a loud mouth style - while it might work for some performers or show oriented careers - doesn't pay in this community. This is generally true of communities in which peers are well able to judge the quality of each other's contributions. Faking it doesn't payoff, and looking like you might need to fake it is counter productive. Insofar as the behaviour of chief hackers is humble, we learn more about the social economy of hackerdom than about distinctive individual personalities.

Despite many insights, Eric Raymond is wrong in his principal analysis. Why, he asks, do talented people spend years of unpaid work on projects that benefit others for no pecuniary reward? He characterizes hackers as members of a gift giving community, and attributes too much of the hacker motivation to altruism and idealism.

The central problem is not ""why do hackers work for no pay?"" Rather, why do people work for money? Or, more fundamentally, why do people work? I take it that readers will agree that we can roughly divide our motives into physiological drives (hunger, thirst, need for shelter, sex) and the ""higher"" needs (self fulfilment and meaning). After satisfying the needs for food, shelter and companionship why do we continue to work at all? If it is to get status, to get power, to feel good about ourselves and similar, then money beyond basic needs is unnecessary. Onassis once remarked ""Without women, all the money in the world is worthless."" Some of us work to become wealthy, and we trade that wealth for status, power, respect and admiration, and perhaps we use our wealth to get women, sex and occasionally love. If this is what these motives are for, then even the higher needs are secondary to sex; or, as evolutionary psychologists tell us, are all about reproduction.

Money is a means. If I can earn status, power and respect directly, why waste time with money? Of course, money is fungible. That means it can be traded easily for a great many things; a big house and a luxury car, perhaps. But possessing these is merely another way of obtaining status, power, respect, admiration and sex, if not love.

Why am I writing this review? By my own dispassionate analysis, I am advertising my capacity to say sensible things and I am making a reputation; this is an asset in the social and commercial market place. Amazon might like me for doing this, but they would be mistaken to think that I write reviews out of altruism directed at Amazon; at least not defined in any metaphysical or moral sense. Sociobiologists denote some social instincts ""altruism"" but these are operational definitions of instincts as Machiavellian as any scheming tactician can be said to possess; in that sense I may be an altruist. Hackers too, for their work is not unlike my book reviews. Hackers trade in an economy that differs not one jot from the money economy, and Eric Raymond, in so far as he supposes it to be a fundamentally different kind of economy, is mistaken.

Likewise the account of hacker commitment to lofty ideals are not any more credible - but also not any less credible - than the mission statements and codes of ethics written by CEOs of major corporations. Among hackers are people as likely to steal code as are others to donate code; to write viruses as to write Fetch Mail. An anarchic disrespect for some of our more widely accepted conventions for protecting property rights is a characteristic of hacker mentality; not one that we should admire. Of course, honourable idealists are found among hackers; Eric Raymond is clearly one of them. Take, for example, the Open Source Initiative that is largely his work. What an outstanding contribution that is! Clearly he is passionate about his beliefs and ideals. But honourable idealists are found among entrepreneurs too, also successful ones, and even among politicians. Let us not delude ourselves about what it is the really motivates us and our fellow travellers.",7

GREVIEWS,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Universal Computer: The Road from Leibniz to Turing,The Universal Computer,"Dr. Martin Davis' book is excellent! It starts out to be biographies of seven great mathematicians/logicians, but is so much more.

Dr. Davis has a way of presenting the math in a style that practically anyone can understand with a little effort. Also, Dr. Davis adds anecdotes about some of the men in his book because he knew them or heard them speak. Also, Dr. Davis is a math/logic professor with many years of experience. The book presents the material so the reader feels like he's reading an exciting story. The book is exciting and energetic.

Juan J. Casero,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation and Management (5th Edition)",Open the doors to RDBMS,This book opened the doors of relational database management systems to me. Prior to reading it I had some general experience with MySQL but an incomplete understanding of the subject. Much to my surprise I found I really liked working with a RDBMS's so I began searching for a book that would give me a solid introdcution to the theory and practice. I think this book fit the bill. After reading it I was ready to tackle a data migration project from Unify to Informix. Now I work as a database programmer. I have since purchased and read other RDBMS books about Informix (the RDBMS I have worked most with) but I find that I still refer to this text from time to time to clear up some minor points of confusion. This book will not make you an expert with RDBMS's but it will give you the background necessary to build up your confidence so you can tackle other tasks. At times the prose can be a bit drawn out but those sections are few and far between. Be advised though that this book uses conceptual/practical approach to database design. While it provide some examples using MS Access and Oracle I find the conceptual discussions more interesting and indeed more useful. With this foundation I was able to begin working with Informix Dynamic Server-an RDBMS that is clearly not the focus of this book.,5

Whatever the case, this text revolves around use of UML in database modeling, which is not my favorite tool for this time. I like ERDs and what's more foot-crow ERDs. So, I couldn't find any in this text. But, since authors say that UML is pretty much becoming a standard and many people would agree with them, I will keep my preference for crows-foot ERD to myslef.

J. C. Martin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation and Management (5th Edition)",Only if required for class,"This book was a required textbook for a graduate database class I was taking. Having spent the last 20 years in industry working with various database systems, this class was mostly review, and the textbook was needed to do assignments.

I find the book to be a poor reference, and not worth owning. One of the things the instructor liked about the book was the extensive case study type problems. This was obviously due to the disconnect between the fantasy world of academia and the reality of industry. I found the case study problems to be poorly contrived and artificial, and at times stupid and needlessly ambiguous. Confusing matters further at times was the difference between the authors use of British terms, phrases, and concepts in the problem descriptions with no explanation or disambiguation. Overall organization of the book is also odd, which left our instructor skipping backward and forward through chapters out of order and at times presenting two chapters simultaneously.

The book is huge and most of it is not worth reading, which makes it even more of a pain to have to lug it around for the few bits that you do need for class. It seems to be a favorite of professors, which is probably why it is in its 5th edition, but that doesn't mean it is any good.",7
Master Po,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation and Management (5th Edition)",Not an Introductory Book,"If you need to buy this book for a class, you're going to need another book. This text is very comprehensive, but does not describe concepts well. When the author defines terms, he often uses the same term or a variation of it in the explanation. Not a good teaching strategy, but that's just me. I was surprised this book was written by a Scot. I expected better explanations from the ""English-Speaking Peoples.""",2
Chris S. Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation and Management (5th Edition)",Excellent and comprehensive database book,"This book isn't for the faint of heart. It's not for someone who wants a quick understanding of how to create a database. This book is for someone who, whether student or practitioner, wants a completely thorough treatment of the topic of databases, with virtually no topic left out, and with enough detail and examples to apply the techniques in practice.

It will be most valuable if you have at least some experience or exposure to databases, but if you're really are interested in the topic, it's not necessary. There were a few places in the opening chapters that briefly spoke to concepts not yet introduced, or assumed some IT background, though this is rare, and the studious reader could use the index to temporarily jump ahead and gain sufficient understanding.

That said, this is the most comprehensive book on databases, from idea through implementation, logical through physical, including optimization, that I have ever read. There isn't a topic that I've come across in my experience with database related projects, or my own attempts to create business tools using a database, that this book doesn't appropriately address.

Having managed numerous IT projects using Oracle, DB2, and SQL Server, I already had a good foundation in databases. But then I found myself creating a few databases myself using MS Access (Jet and MSDE) and then SQL Server. However, it's one thing to manage a project that uses a database, but quite another to be doing the design and development oneself. I experienced moments of frustration when I couldn't use some of the views/queries to perform updates to the base tables, and when I couldn't get some views/queries to work as intended, or sometimes wasn't sure how to start to author a solution (I learned that some of my relationships were highly recursive and that is a weakness of the relational model, and solved by a little bit of code). This book gave me the insights as to why each was the case, as well how to solve all of them. There's nothing like experiencing a, ""Why won't this work!"", followed by, ""Oh, that's why."", followed by, ""That was easy to fix."" That's what this book did, when numerous other books on Access and SQL Server were too high level.

Some have indicated this book to be boring, and padded with unnecessary text. It isn't exciting like a thriller, but it's not supposed to be. Its intention is to educate, and it does that exceedingly well. If you have a thirst for knowledge or passion for databases or information systems, you'll love it. If you're a student with no choice but to take a course that uses this text, but are otherwise uninterested in databases, you would probably rather be using a more high level and less expensive book. However, if you plan a career in IT, don't sell this book back. I assure you that you will use it in the future.

Someone else didn't like the writing style of the book because the authors are from the United Kingdom. This is rarely evident, but when it is, it doesn't detract: flat=apartment, pound=money, Glasgow=city.

The syntax for commands were not adequately explained and were horribly intertwined in the examples, such that it was difficult to derive the real syntax for individual clauses and commands. Chapters on modeling the database via ER and EER were also vague and written very poorly. Examples throughout the book used coincidental values and scenarios that mask out the true nature of the concepts being proposed. The author should have taken the time to put in ""meaningful"" examples. The exercises at the end of each chapter do not define the scope of questions being asked. They are too open ended.

galaxy_express_899,3.0 out of 5 stars,Feynman Lectures On Computation,Dissapointing,"I find this book dissapointing. It doesn't compare with the insight, clarity, and beauty found in the famous ""Feynman lectures in physics"". Basically what Feynman does in this book is simplify and coaches one though complex Computer Science/ Information Theory Concepts. The book may have the small size of a novel, but I find it to be more like a textbook; because it has many equations (even exercises in the first chapter), and also one has to be quite attentive while reading. I'm not saying this is a bad book, only that, if you liked the ""Feynman lectures in physics"" it doesn't automatically mean you'll like this book. This book is different, obviously in the sense that it doesn't deal much with physics, and secondly in the fact that it is not passionatly written, I think. Why is this book so expensive anyways?
Now that you got my warning. I can definitely recomend this book for people intereseted in things like:
-theoretical limits of computers (enthropy, energy)
-physical realizations of logic gates (transistors)
-quantum computers",15

In actuality, most of it is a rather haphazard tour of selected topics from basic computer science, using the old-fashioned bottom-up approach (starting with gates and flip-flops). There are your basic bits about Turing machines and information theory, and some weird stuff about reversible logic which supposedly leads on to the quantum computing. Then there is a reprint of an article about quantum computing which rehashes the latter bits and goes a bit farther, but unfortunately my training in quantum physics did not allow me to follow it. If you want to read good Feynman, try things like Q.E.D., which is brilliant.",5
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beginning Database Design: From Novice to Professional,Got Data? Here's a guide on how to manage it!,"What this book is: It's a guide to learn how to design databases. Expect to learn new ways of thinking about the data you have and how to anticipate future data requirements. You'll also learn the kinds of questions you should ask in order to get an understanding of how the data will be used and what other data might be helpful.

What it is not: Don't expect to learn much about any specific Database software. It won't teach you much SQL, Microsoft Access, or any other Database software. (There are some section that bring up certain areas of these topics and basic Database Querying is discussed, but it's far from being in depth.)

The majority of the book explains how a database can be designed so that it match the needs of most clients, and how to anticipate the future needs of a client. It discussions the relationships between data and how to maintain those relationships. It highlights common mistakes in database design that can add unintended limitations and shows alternate ways of designing the same databases to allow the data freedom to grow.

I purchased this book for two reasons. One is that I'm a firm believer in learning and mastering fundamentals. In my case, I do a lot of computer programming. I've learned that the most important part of any software is it's data. Another reason is that I was assigned a project at work that involved updating a database to meet a new requirement. (I don't find the fundamentals as terribly interesting to study (like most people), but their value is priceless).

Each chapter includes review questions at the end to put into practice what you learned. There is not any solutions given to help you know if you answered the questions correctly, but it helps to you go back and review some of the topics for better learning.

I detracted one star for the sake of the Kindle version of the book not being correctly formatted. The Kindle version identifies the Topic Headers as ""Chapters"" rather than having the Chapters as ""Chapters"". Kindle readers estimate how much time till I've completed reading a chapter, but throughout the entire book, it was estimating how much time until the next section. Rather annoying. (Not sure if this is the fault of Amazon or Apress).

Despite that, I can give my recommendation of the content of this book on this topic. Mastering these fundamentals will truly make you a ""Professional"" database designer.",12

I was confused from the beginning because he didn’t talk about the historical context of the presentation: where did this particular Bell Game come from? (e.g., the ``bounded by 3’’ inequality is unusual and not in Wikipedia). What makes Gisin’s tests different from most other tests (like Zeilinger’s)? I think he should have introduced some background material before elaborating on the details of his Bell test. Early Bell discussions were for electron spins but for practical reasons then switched to light polarizations. I wasn’t familiar with his ``time-bin encoded quantum information’’ (but I now know it is something worth knowing and he claims it to be better for long distances). I was expecting to understand traditional polarization experiments, so his time-bin test threw me for the first half of the book. Maybe others will have an easier time than I did (especially since most of the reviews were very positive). He has few figures, and his Figure 5.1 with tilted polarizations was irrelevant didn’t pertain to his time bin testing. And his term ``anti-parallel’’ only applies to spins (it seems that the book has a few editing problems). It wasn’t clear what the crystals in Bob and Alice’s boxes did (store correlation data?). He is strongly against local hidden variables but didn’t say much about Bohm’s non-local hidden variables or mechanisms. And he didn’t appear to know about Aharonov or Penrose or Cramer/Kastner for quantum time-reversible information versus classical time-forward information.

Joseph L. Famulary,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Quantum Chance: Nonlocality, Teleportation and Other Quantum Marvels","A good short work, but you should be comfortable with basic algebra to get it on first reading.","If you love physics, but do not have a scientific background, you can get through this short work with some effort. It revolves largely around Bell's Game (now referred to as Bell's Theorem to give it some dignity). Bell's Game demonstrates that things can happen at faster than light speeds, a strong contradiction to Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity. But, and this saves the discrepancy, no information can be carried at such speeds. This is the quantum physics concept of entanglement. You do not have to have a mathematical background to grasp the main ideas of this work. But if you do not have some experience with math you will probably get lost and give up. It took me about four hours over the course of a few days to grasp the math because of all the possibilities, probabilities, and ""rules"" of the game.

During the past decade or so many books on quantum physics have been published that are aimed at the laymen. Most attempt to deal with the problem of uncertainty, which is at the root of quantum physics, and, for lack of a better term, certainty (or determinism if you like), which is the foundation of classical physics. This clash has been described as physics in crisis. Humankind has always felt a need to understand the world/universe. When something happens that cannot be explained (e.g. lightning), then some paranormal explanation is called into play...the gods. Later, when lightning is understood scientifically, the gods are released as the creators. But the paranormal is still very much with us worldwide. So the mystics have jumped on uncertainty to declare that it is obvious science does not, and cannot, have all the answers; but we do. This has been a great thorn in the side of scientists as they struggle to deal with uncertainty.

Thankfully, this work does not delve into that debate directly. You will learn something about the uncertainty principle and the clash with classical physics. And the author does point out that what we know now will almost certainly not be the same a thousand years from now (assuming the unlikely scenario where mankind does not destroy itself). So the reader is urged to try to understand science as best we know it now.

Perhaps when the LHC (CERN) starts up again this year we may make new discoveries in physics that may some day lead to ""The Theory of Everything."" Until then, pay your money and take your choice. Or maybe figure out how to reconcile physics and metaphysics.

He shows the human free will is essential to make sense of nonlocal Bell's quantum mechanics. Yet he shies away from declaring himself a dualist. There are two fundamental entities, affecting each other, matter and mind (not clear in detail yet). It's not a ""gap"" in our knowledge, it's an antinomy. There is a difference between ""gaps"" and Kant's antinomies. Antinomies are infinities (both in time and space), and the (quantum) Chance, on which quantum mechanics is based, and the free will. They appear more and more beyond our understanding. Mankind will eventually fill the gaps, like between apes and humans etc. - yet, why are we so different from the animals that we want to understand the universe? There is no evolutionary advantage in that. I wish Gisin acknowledge all that... Yet, I loved this book.",1
Barry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quantum Chance: Nonlocality, Teleportation and Other Quantum Marvels",The Implications of Non-locality,"Often in books popularizing theoretical physics we find history and mathematics mixed in a rather 'uncomfortable' way. Too often authors
fail to put sufficient emphasis on interpretation and/or meaning of the material presented. This is particularly true of popularizers of
Quantum mechanics. This is a not-unexpected consequence of there being at least four interpretations of quantum mechanics. The appropriate
conclusion must be that at least three of the interpretations (and probably four) are wrong. The non-locality of our universe, once an astonishing
conjecture is now a proven fact. In his book, ""Quantum Chance"", Nicolas Gisin brings an astonishing clarity to this difficult topic. He begins
by modeling non-locality as ""Bell's game"". This model presents the nature of quantum correlations in a remarkably clear and accurate way. Mathematical
demands on the reader are minimal but the extraordinary implications of John Bell's theorem are presented with remarkable lucidity. Dr. Gisin
explains in a fundamental way the meaning of chance and its relation to 'reducible' and 'irreducible' randomness. He then gives the profound
implications of non-local correlations. He explains that such correlations represent particles (or events) that cannot be predetermined nor can they
have a 'history' i.e.-they are ""new"" things in the universe. It is this 'newness' that is the basis of creativity, free will and I would
guess. complexity. If this seems like ""a bit of a stretch"" then I can only recommend that you read this remarkable book. Dr. Gisin is very
persuasive.

Steven Forth doubts that I have read the book. Janet withdrew her comment so I will never know what it said. Mats Frick says my writing is an ""obvious attempt to divert potential readers from gaining insight into climate science."" Robert Welcyng appreciates my comments. Steven K wants me to exercise my mind. Elliot Zais says that I am not up to the task of reading the book and compares me to Beck and Limbaugh. Daniel Yee suggests I am a lay reader. Rblan comes to my defense.

I am surprised that I need to give my C.V. here but perhaps it is important. I hold a BS in biology/chemistry, a Washington State teacher's certificate, 42 additional college credits in marine biology and ecology, and a master's degree in Educational Communication. I even took a meteorology class. I taught for a third of a century, mostly in a suburban school district north of Seattle and two years of that time in Truk High School, E. Caroline Islands, Micronesia; two years traveling the state of WA for the Pacific Science Center bringing a portable van science program to elementary schools, followed by substituting in a private religious school for a chemistry teacher on leave, and finished my career teaching for Seattle Schools Home School Resource Center where parents sent their home schooled children to take a single class such as biology or chemistry.

I have taught biology, marine biology, chemistry, physics, photography, mathematics, earth science, environmental science, and a few other courses I was unprepared for. In one way or another I have taught every level from kindergarten to college level. That has made me a semi expert in converting complicated science into simple terms for the student.

I have always considered myself a liberal green-oriented environmentalist. A few years ago I heard a local radio personality decry human-caused global warming and it made my blood boil. I had seen Gore's movie and was 100% behind it. Since I was retired I decided to research the literature on global warming. After I had read more than 30 volumes, used the U of Washington campus to research and follow up on well over a thousand research papers and read who-knows-how-many web blogs, I contacted the radio personality and apologized for an earlier email where I had said that he did not know what he was talking about.

There is a profound problem with the ""consensus opinion"" on global warming. They will not release the information about the science. They will tell us that all the important scientists agree, but they do not release the bulk of the science for us to see. For the last year I have tried to write a high school textbook that will give both arguments for and against human-caused global warming, the ideas of science both for and against, how-much and how-long. My thought was that a teacher could present the material without taking sides and let the students discuss, take sides, argue and learn about science as a human endeavor. The first thing they should learn is that science is never a consensus for very long and different opinions are what make it great. Unfortunately much of the available literature is political and not science.

""A Vast Machine..."" is completely worthless for my purpose. The author does not even know the basics of communication. He does not explain; he obfuscates. Save your money!",18
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game Physics Engine Development: How to Build a Robust Commercial-Grade Physics Engine for your Game,Great book to get a basic physics engine off the ground,"Overall a great book that enabled me to easily understand the basics of getting a physics engine off the ground. Obviously the physics engine you end up with will be no Source or CryEngine, but it will be enough to produce an indie game. One thing I love about this author is he focuses on code rather than math. This book isn't a college course in physics, it's all about applying the most important laws of physics for simulations in games and it's all about code. Overall, I was satisfied with the physics engine I got out of it. The one thing I will say to potential buyers is that this is NOT the only book you will need if you want to make a physics engine. You will also need a book on collision detection, bounding volume construction, and spacial partitioning algorithms. This book gives a brief overview, but it only touches the surface. I would recommend ""Real Time collision detection"" by Ericson and ""Mathematics for 3D game programming"" by Lengyel as supplemental references.",7
A. M. Hernandez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game Physics Engine Development: How to Build a Robust Commercial-Grade Physics Engine for your Game,"Clear & Practical, Looks Great On Kindle Tablets, Highly Recommended.","In this review, I will discuss my experience with Game Physics Engine Development: How to Build a Robust Commercial-Grade Physics Engine for your Game by Ian Millington. This is actually the first book I’ve ever read solely on game physics and I think I made the right choice here. Although I have developed several physics engines previously, they were only in 2D and the extra dimension complicates matters significantly. Game Physics Engine Development is a book specifically about 3D game physics, though the author does make a short reference to 2D physics at the end. I felt like the book had just enough math to explain the concepts, without getting bogged down in technical minutia. I also enjoyed the friendly writing style, the approachable implementations, and a rational coding standard.

Ian Millington’s book covers a lot of ground, and each chapter builds up a single aspect of the engine. Many chapters could stand alone in one aspect or another, though they do come together at the end. Some of the topics covered include: basic 3D math (vectors, matrices, quaternions), laws of motion, particles, rigid bodies, mass aggregate physics, springs, collision, contact resolution, velocity and acceleration, torque, friction, broad-phase collision detection, bounding volumes, and more. While the book is “only” 552 pages, there are a ton of things packed into those pages. I found the coverage to be fairly in-depth, without getting lost of mathematical proofs or anything like that. The book is very practical in that way, and a lot of the code samples could easily be the basis of a real implementation.

Overall I enjoyed the book at lot, and breezed through it within a week, eagerly anticipating each new chapter. Being the only physics book I’ve read so far, I don’t feel 100% confidant creating a physics engine myself just yet. However, I do feel it has explained a lot of key concepts necessary in physics development. The book was everything I was hoping for, and gets my recommendation.",1
Daniel Greenheck,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game Physics Engine Development: How to Build a Robust Commercial-Grade Physics Engine for your Game,"A book to get you a real, working physics engine.","Let's first say that I've seen my fair share of physics literature. I've pored over papers, tutorials, etc. with little to show beyond some simple collisions between spheres. What I really wanted to implement was something ideally ""not"" much more difficult: a rigid body simulation with simple primitives (spheres, boxes, planes) that collide and interact with each other, giving a realistic enough feel to build a game around.

Unfortunately, even this idea is extremely complex and difficult to implement. You would think the math and code would be fairly easy, and it actually is (depending on your math background. A few semesters of college calculus and physics is very helpful, but not required). But programming a physics engine is 40% math and physics and 60% being clever enough to get the computer to do what you want. Floating point errors, inaccuracies in integration and bugs you can't even imagine from the start all mess with your beautiful equations.

And this is where the author, Ian Millington, saves the day with this great book. All throughout, he lays down the challenges of building a physics engine and gives you realistic solutions that are explained very well. You build from the ground up: from a simple particle engine, to a mass aggregate physics engine, all the way to a full blown physics engine. Each chapter he describes what algorithms you need to implement and variations on those algorithms, providing pros and cons for each. I cannot TELL you how fantastic it feels to have an author tell you in an honest tone: here's where this works, here's where it doesn't. Never at any time do you feel that things are being hid behind a curtain of intellect and egomania. And if the author does hide any details, he tells you and with good reason.

In the end, if you plow through all 20 chapters with diligence and fortitude, you're going to end up with a working physics engine. It will be a physics engine capable of a lot of very cool things, but it isn't a finished product. And the author makes it very clear throughout the book that you will not end up with a spit polished physics engine to compete with the likes of Havok. It will be rough on the edges with plenty of room for improvement, but it gets the job done. The author helps you create a working model and leaves you with many options on how to improvement. However, those options require much more advanced coding.

This book provided me with exactly what I was looking for: the know-how and experience to create a physics engine for the everyday game designer. I highly recommend it. If you want to create something commercial, this is a great start, but you're going to have to buy some heavier books on top of this one if you want a very robust, optimized engine.",20

The material presented is not terse at all; but does require some level of mathematical maturity (some calculus and linear algebra would be helpful; but the author assumes basic algebra and trig). Wikipedia will be your friend if you don't understand the concepts. Overall, the book will leave you with a working physics engine that you can use for future development.",1

That said, the book does give a fully working engine, which counts for a lot.

Overall a solid foundation, but you may want to supplement with more advanced materials.",2
techno hermit,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game Physics Engine Development: How to Build a Robust Commercial-Grade Physics Engine for your Game,"excellent, practical game physics introduction","This book is an excellent, practical introduction to game physics engine developers. The goals is to take a good programmer [and 3D engine/game developer] with little or no physics experience, and help him upgrade his 3D engine from ""no physics"" to ""modest physics"". Thus the book covers the most fundamental and important types of physics for most games, but omits most niche or highly advanced [special purpose] physics.

The great strength of this book is the near absense of ""arm waving"". The types of physics this book covers are covered more-or-less completely, and implemented in the code that can be downloaded and inspected.

In most 3D books, and especially ""physics engine"" books, the author discusses each issue more-or-less independently, and in varying levels of detail (for his convenience), then leaves the reader to figure out how to effectively implement the details of the technique, and worse, to encounter and deal with the many practical tradeoffs and gotchas on his own.

In contrast, this author discusses each issue in exactly as much depth and detail as necessary to implement code that works, and deals with practical tradeoffs, gotchas, and integration with the rest of the engine. This makes the book far more helpful for programmers who are not scientists or not very familiar with newtonian-style physics.

Frankly, I'd love for this book to have a ""second half"" that revisits each level at a higher, more advanced and/or more abstract level, plus discusses many niche/specialty types of physics for game engines. However, the author and publisher leave the Eberly ""game physics"" book to satisfy that desire. The Eberly game physics book is also excellent, but suffers from the common ""weaknesses"" that I mention this book does not suffer from. On the other hand, ""weakness"" is a relative term --- the Eberly book may be written in a perfectly fine manner for scientists, physicists, and especially math wizards (or at least highly comfortable with advanced mathematics).

This book does have a few weaknesses.

It fills far too many lines and pages with same source-code. The problem is not that he includes source-code, that much is fine. The problem is, most of the source-code he includes in the text of the book contains lengthy comments that simply repeat what we just read in the body of the text. This wastes a LOT of space, pushes related paragraphs onto separate pages where they are more difficult to glance back and forth to compare, and makes the few lines of actual code difficult to locate visually between the lengthy comment blocks. He should omit most if not all these comments, then the source-code would make a substantial contribution to the book, rather than mostly just be annoying.

I found a few errors in the book, but so far have not found errata anywhere (for example, on the [...] website).

I also have not yet found a forum dedicated to this book and the physics engine it implements. This would make it a lot easier for readers to get quick, easy answers to questions, confusions, errata, etc.

While the author carefully explained his notation, he would have been better served to adopt the simplest notation possible for this book aimed at the minimally math-savvy audience the book is otherwise so perfectly written for. I mean, is there any reason we must read f = mp (with two dots over the p) instead of f = ma ??? It is as-if ""v"" for ""velocity"" and ""a"" for ""acceleration"" are x-rated words, and this is a PG book... or something. Elsewhere the author wisely adopted the most clear, simple ways to express his ideas and the math. He should have stuck to that principle. Alternatively, almost everywhere he had plenty of room to state each equation in both forms. This would have been a great service to less math-savvy readers, as seeing equivalent forms side-by-side repeatly is a great way to become comfortable with more advanced symbology and formulation.

Bottom line: The strengths of this book are far greater and more precious and rare than the weaknesses. Everyone trying to implement a physics engine should buy this book. However, physics engines are chock full of subtle issues, niche fields, gotchas and quirks, anyone who actually implements one should get every recent (less than ~7 years old) book and PDF, and read everything, and keep them around for reference, comparisions, and varied presentation.",2

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Game Physics Engine Development: How to Build a Robust Commercial-Grade Physics Engine for your Game,Not what I had hoped for,"I already had a book on physics for games on my shelf and I bought this one online (without seeing inside) hoping it would be more clear than the one I already had. Nope. Not a bit.

Both of them assume you have a bachlors degree in physics or mathematics. Ok. That's a slight exageration. But let me tell you Force equals Mass times Acceleration. Did that take Calculus notation to explain? Apparently it does because both books explain the most simple concepts by giving you calculus formulas. That's great if you've taken a few years of calculus in college. But for normal people you might as well write the book in a foreign language. And I understand basic college level physics. My college physics text book for the first two semesters doesn't have one calculus formula in it ANYWHERE. Not ONE.

That's awesome that the author knows calculus. Quite frankly I'm a little jealous and wish I would take the time to take a calculus class. But in the meantime this book is useless to me. But what's worse is that I know basic physics and I know for a fact that it doesn't require ANY knowledge of calculus until you get into simulations far more complex than you typically find in a video game. And I can program in Assembly Language and I can tell you for a fact the CPU doesn't know calculus. So you're going to have translate all those pretty little integrals and differentials into addition, multiplication, and bitwise logic before it will run on a computer. So, you might as well explain it to the programmer in English and provide some working computer code.

So, if you are very comfortable reading calculus equations and want to learn how you might put together a physics engine for a game, there's probably a lot to learn here. But, if you don't know calculus, you're probably just wasting a tree because the paper this is written on won't do any good for you unless you toss it in the fire for warmth.

Even the vector notation is a little ""over the top"". I know vectors well enough to teach the subject, but I haven't studied it in years, and we really only covered it for a brief period of time. I would have to go do a refresher for a couple of weeks just to read the notation. But vectors aren't that hard to understand. It's just that I never spent four years working vector problems to get used to the way they are typically notated. For people that don't even understand vectors, this is going to be seriously rough.

I'm going back to my college physics text book. I think it was much more clear on the subject even though it had nothing to do with video games.

I give this book 2 stars because I believe it's largely useless to anyone not well on their way to earning a physics, engineering, or mathematics degree, which should eliminate 90% of the people who might be interested. But, I believe it might be useful to someone with a solid understanding of calculus, so I didn't want to score it any lower. Since I don't know calculus, I couldn't tell you for sure.",9

The author has a friendly style: ""If we were the size of atoms and we experienced the laws of quantum theory on a daily basis, then perhaps the quantum theory would be as intuitive to us as Newton's law of universal gravitation."" The author weaves exercises in with the text to keep you thinking and makes references to the exercises in discussions.

John Anderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Information, Entropy, Life and the Universe: What We Know and What We Do Not Know",Dangerous Idea: Demanding Rigor in Science Writing,"Arieh Ben-Naim’s latest book in a series of 5 books about the perplexing topic of entropy and information is a brave attempt to bring precision and rigor to a topic that has befuddled many readers of popular science books. In this volume he directly challenges several current popular authors who apply the concepts of entropy and information to topics like life, evolution, and the universe in ways that are confusing and, to use one of Ben-Naim’s favorite adjectives, meaningless. One hopes that some of these scientists and science writers will respond and clarify or defend their writing. This would benefit the curious public greatly. Full disclosure: I was a proof reader of an early draft of the book because I was hoping the book would stimulate debate on several topics that I love to study.

The first two chapters are a thorough and lengthy tutorial on information theory as developed by Claude Shannon of Bell Labs and entropy, that elusive concept developed by Clausius, Thomson, Boltzmann, and Gibbs. There is a less rigorous mathematical focus in this book compared to his earlier volumes, but there is still plenty to digest especially if you go to the end notes every time there is a reference. Setting the stage requires 275 out of the 406 pages. (I’m not sure that all of the math is error free.)

Why spend so much time on basics? To address a root of the problem. Many statements by well known authors “are the result of confusing information with SMI (Shannon’s Measure of Information), then confusing SMI with entropy, and finally applying entropy to predict the fate of life and of the universe.”

To bring his points home Ben-Naim badgers the reader by repetition and alternative explanations. The terminology brings much baggage that must be stripped away. For example, Shannon developed what is called information theory but it is really communication theory. His work deals with the transmission of error free data over communication links. It does not address the content of the message, i.e. it doesn’t concern what we colloquially call information. Shannon didn’t care if the message was written by Shakespeare or Daffy Duck. The term “bit” is a unit of information on the same level as centimeter is a unit of length. Some people claim the universe is made of bits. “But the bit is a unit of information, not information, and certainly not the smallest possible chunk of information.”

The last two chapters apply the concepts to living systems and the universe. I am particularly interested in the concepts of the entropy of the universe and black hole entropy, particularly Sean Carroll’s Past Hypothesis which Carroll asserts explains the arrow of time. Ben-Naim criticizes the popular writing on these topics for lacking a justification for using the term “entropy” in these cases. The “entropy of the universe” may be totally meaningless since the universe is not a well defined thermodynamic system at equilibrium and we have no way to measure it.

Similarly a black hole “is far from being well-defined and well-characterized object. Trying to estimate its entropy based on its mass, energy or the area of its horizon is, at best, making an estimate of the entropy of the BH if that would be definable. It does not provide any additional information beyond that.”",2
Michael F Rainbolt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Information, Entropy, Life and the Universe: What We Know and What We Do Not Know",This book should be and deserves to be a best seller. The book is loaded with information theory,"In January of this year (2015) I began corresponding with Professor Ben-Naim. Shortly thereafter, I was invited to review his manuscript for this book. It was thrilling to see a book at this stage of its development and I read it several times. I was amazed by the Professor’s world-class knowledge and expertise in each topic and I came to realize and appreciate that these books are hard work. This book should be and deserves to be a best seller.

The book is loaded with information theory, Second Law principles and concepts and the application of probability to these subjects. The book is well organized and beautifully written. In Chapter Two, the professor thoroughly covers Maxwell’s Demon and is undoubtedly one the best analysis and commentary ever written on this paradox. In Chapter Three, the professor explains Schrödinger’s Cat in a most interesting way. I was very impressed and admired the author for identifying, criticizing and correcting unsupportable statements and conclusions made by some of the well-known, established scientists involved in these subjects. Ben-Naim had the fortitude, intellect and the courage to rightfully point out these errors and exposes them. In regards to evolution, Ben-Naim treats the subject with respect for all. Everyone will enjoy his vision of the future of the Universe and the future of the human race. Lastly, I would like to thank Professor Ben-Naim for the honor and privilege of being one of the reviewers and most of all for his friendship.",1

I dug this book because I wanted to explore the headspace, perspective, context and helpful flows that lend themselves to building the right experience for the right users.

Just like the designers, developers, architects and business-heads I work with, my job includes working to ensure the right people are on board with the best approaches and the best solutions. For me, this book took a super-realistic approach towards the challenges and opportunities that come with driving to get the right UX solutions.

It's not crazy to say that building software that performs is really difficult. That said, designing and building software that performs and offers the right experience comes with a whole different level of difficulty (it's way harder). This book definitely isn't a step-by-step manual - there's no 2+2=4 kind of formula for good UX.

The way I see it, there are enough ""how-to"" books out there if I wanted to learn more about building software that performs. There are however very few books that offer insight into successful approach and philosophy behind setting the business/design/development table for building the right experience for the right users - this is one of those rare books.

Andrzej J. Taramina,1.0 out of 5 stars,Effective UI: The Art of Building Great User Experience in Software,Want to deliver more effective UIs? Don't waste your money...,"If you are looking for a good book on UI design principles, methods, tips and tricks, with concrete examples and suggestions, then don't bother spending your money on this tome. It should have been titled ""Effective PM (for beginners)"", as it's almost exclusively about project management rather than UI design.

If you are familiar with iterative development practices, agile, the perils of waterfall, requirements analysis, stakeholder relations, team building and the overall software project management process, then you will find nothing new in this book. The first few chapters read like a marketing brochure for the Effective UI consulting group. If you know little of these areas, or have a manager/stakeholder that you want to try to convert, then this book might provide some value as a high level introduction to software project management.

To me, this was very disappointing. I have dozens and dozens of O'Reilly books, decades of SW dev experience from C-level on down, and this is the first O'Reilly book that I've purchased that I would send back (if that just wasn't worth the time/trouble to do so). I'll probably just give it to the Goodwill charity, and hope that someone can benefit from it.

With it's current title, I rate this barely as a 1, and then only because they included some interesting, albeit barely relevant, quotes from Clausewitz and Sun Tzu. If they had changed the title to ""Effective PM - An Introduction to Software Development management/practices"" then it might rate a 3.

ClawedB,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Eye Opening,"No, I have not read 'Fooled by Randomness'. Taleb's cheekiness and loquaciousness carries on to the point of pain in several parts of this book, and there were moments while reading part that I wanted to put this book down and set it on fire, because Taleb beats you over the head with examples of his philosophy that are only marginally different. However, by the end of the book, I was looking at the world in a new way. That being said, I believe this book in its entirety is very difficult to appreciate if you are not in the correct mindset. I am an early/mid-20's finance professional going through a period of disillusionment for example. I'm asking a lot of 'why' questions that are getting under the skin of more learned people for reasons that I, and I'm fairly certain they, did not understand. I am seeing inconsistencies in things that are treated like immutable laws. But most of all I'm beginning to prefer the initial emotional abyss of knowing that I know little and am a single person doggy paddling in the ocean, than the false intellectual security reminiscent of being a passenger in first class on the Titanic.

In many ways this book tells us things that we all already know, but part of the reason that I believe it is so long is that it needs to systematically go through so many examples of situations that we all use the same type of false logic in, and tell us that it is harmful, no matter how trivial the situation may seem. Embracing what this book is trying to say is painful, and will cause extreme amounts of cognitive dissonance if you are not in the right place. You can generally tell if you fall into that category, when you find yourself picking holes in the edge of the argument for black swans, rather that looking at your held beliefs through the central idea of the book: seeing a million white swans does not confirm the theory that every swan is white, however the sight of one black swan means that the theory is irreparably flawed.

as a real world example, an algorithm that can perfectly predict a normal commodity market and provide consistent returns for 5 years, but is wrong for one day when the market moves 200+% due to a spontaneous crisis, is useless. The one day is the only thing that mattered, while the 20% years of small consistency are the statistical noise.

Most people will always prefer a seemingly solid floor to stand on, even if it prevents them from realizing that they're sinking into the ocean",18

These events exist outside the ordinary where small perturbations of little real account can be managed for. Since we can;t predict Black Swans, we can manage so as to reduce the risk from negative swans and be ready and receptive to take advantage of positive ones.

I am still absorbing this but I think it has changed how I look at things and manage for risk and opportunity.

Nick Stegmeier,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Black Swans -- What they are, where they happen, and how to be robust against them","Taleb's book presents important ideas concerning the limits of human knowledge. If taken seriously and found to be true, his ideas could certainly change modern civilization for the better.

The main contention is that modern life -- characterized by a global economy, ever increasing social networks, and exponential feedback loops -- is NOT amenable to Gaussian statistics, or the proverbial Bell Curve. A potent example was the 2008 economic crisis, which was wholly unforeseen by the economic gurus in their statistically fortified ivy towers. Taleb argues that events like the 2008 crisis are by nature unpredictable by conventional statistical methods and, due to the cacophony of variables that generate them, may not be amenable to any kind of statistical prediction. Instead, areas of life that are exposed to such events should be organized in such a way that they are black swan robust, i.e., diversified and having subsidiarity.

I await the academic response to his papers refuting Gaussian probability in the area of life he calls ""Extremistan"", which is where so-called Black Swans, or unpredictable events, occur. It is one thing to write a book for the public and another altogether to withstand peer reviewed science, no matter his disregard for the scientific ""authority"" of statisticians.

In short, it was a good book that presented interesting and compelling ideas. I await further academic corroboration.",1
Thomas M. Magee,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Change your mind,"This book is very hard to describe. I first got into this book because this book seems to be one of those things other authors quote. It is a mix of things in one mold. It is both a text book of sorts plus a political book. The text is very descriptive. It is full of the author's personality and vibrant opinions. To me his loud words makes the dry subject matter interesting. I saw a few others here take great offense at that.

The easiest way to describe this would be to say it is an anti-statistical text book. Nassim Nicholas Taleb attacks the way statistics is used to shape decisions in today's world. As he walks through his examples you will realize just how much things are shaped by statistics. This shaping is as much a product of good marketing as it is by human nature to seek certainty in an uncertain world. Nowadays that uncertainty seems so always present in every newspaper we see. Through this explanation of the author's arguments will make you definitely go ummmm!!

For an example we in the world like to view things in the parabolic bulge. Most people reside in the flat middle. However the old 80/20 seems to shoot holes in that idea. That rule says basically life operates in the extremes, the ends of the parabolic curve. The most profitable anything, authors, football players, whatever exist in the top 5 percent. Organization practice is that 20 percent of your workers due 80 percent of your work. Just one example of how the book attacks old ideas.

His description of this ideas are really thought provoking. It will cause you to reevaluate everything you thought about statistics. It really goes deeper than that. After reading the book you will see all of life different. Where as I don't think you can totally throw out statistics the author has some very valid points. It will change how you view the world.",5

I have no mathematical or statistical expertise, so all my understanding on these subjects comes from popular wisdom and business school. Taleb considers those two to be distilled from the same source, which source he questions.

Well, we all know what that's worth now - but what is the alternative? Taleb provides us with the ideal one. He adopts a discursive approach: you feel as though he is merely talking to you from the pages of the book. He follows Einstein's precept: Make everything as easy as possible; but no easier. This book is like a work-out for the mind, stretching and strengthening it, providing us with the knowledge and the arguments necessary to challenge the so-called ""experts"", identify their vested interests, understand how we are being manipulated and resist that manipulation.

Roberto Roman L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Excellent book on how systems really work....,"This book is not simple to read. One has to really dig in to start appreciating its insights, humor and very exact insights. Basically: one has to be skeptical (not gullible), even though our very nature tends that we accept ""Tall Tales"" (which are in our genes). Also that complex systems have redundancy built into them and that nature (and life) is a constant experiment.

Thus ""models"" have only very limited usefullnes, and help (normally) in ""dull"" systems.

This is the first time I've read an understandable explanation of fractal systems. And it also confirmed what I thought probable: Econometrics and economic systems analysis is either hot air or (as Nicholas Taleb puts it): Bull***t.

Combine liberal dollops of humour, deep thought and you have an engrossing book.

In the Second Edition there are great insghts into the 2008 Meltdown. This ""crisis"" doesn't fit in with a *real* Black Swan, since the people who thought about it saw it coming, but is a perfect example of how we need to totally rethink on how we manage risk in real systems. Basically, you can't predict risk, son you have to prepare yourself as best as possible (hedge your bets).

Great reading!",1
M. Abramson,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Eye opener,"Once in a while, a book comes up that tell you something new.
This is such a book.

This book makes the problem of knowledge come alive. It basically
addresses the question of what knowledge and the acquisition of
knowledge mean especially when it's what we don't know, the black
swans, that impacts us the most. This problem comes alive in the story
of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's (NNT) life and how he grew up in war-torn
Lebanon, a country reputed for its long-lasting peace. In turn, I can't help but
finding ""black swans"" in my life as well. I wonder how many people have
black swans in their closet so-to-speak.

The black swan problem leads to skepticism toward science and
causality. Religion and faith are the alternatives. Erudition is
necessary to keep an open mind. Scholarship w/o erudition leads to
disaster: platonicity and simplification. NNT does seem to take
pleasure to display his erudition.

While this book does not propose new theoretical paradigms for
predicting black swans (that wouldn't make sense), it gives some
practical advice for making decisions in an uncertain world. One such
advice is to ""maximize the serendipity around you"" and another is to
""worry less about embarrassement than about missing an opportunity.""
In this context, the chance aspects of success (""success is a
cummulative advantage"") are clearly exposed and for that, this book gets 4 stars.",2
Leon Felipe Palafox Novack,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"An interesting idea. Yet, it fails to deliver","The idea of Black Swans, infrequent events with great consequences, is the main topic of this book. I found that the author had deep and serious problems stating his examples, and his research was indeed deeply flawed.

After having read most of Gladwell's books, this book reminds me of an idea in one of them: Blink. A Blink is the ability of an expert to be ""natural"", through deep training and continuous repetition of a task. An expert only has the ""gift"" after having practiced the same task over and over. Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. This gift, research has shown, is common to military strategists and stock traders. Oddly enough, the same thinkers Nassim takes as empiricists and knowers of the real world.

It just happens that much of what Nassim thinks is an empiric way of thinking is nothing but the ""blink"" of having been deeeply trained all over the years on different situations and environments.

Nassim's theory falls apart when we do a deep analysis of the 2008 financial crisis. Clearly explained in The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine by Lewis. This traders shortsightedness and confidence in their own abilities, prevented them from considering the possible downfall of the mortgage market (since it never happened before, Ha! a Black Swan). Thus putting in clear evidence, that this traders Nassim cherishes so much are perhaps even greater victims to black swans. Yet in the book, we can see how people with deep analytic points of view, were able to predict the downfall.

The example of the Fat Tony, is just wrong, even by his logic. Nassim states of this Fat Tony who has cash and luck. But where are the other Fat Tony's who do not have neither of those. Instead, someone who graduated top in his class in college, has a lot more probability of having a good life and a secure job. (Last time I checked, tenured professor was one of the best paid and secure jobs in the world). Most of the people who do not finish college have a lot of problems landing a good job (again, his research is just poor)

The book fails to deliver convincing arguments to an otherwise interesting idea.",1
Stephen,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Black Swan - Audiobook CD,"Book: The book was interesting discussion of non-routine events, ""Black Swans"". His thesis is that non-rountine events are routine and occur in more areas than others. He attests forecastos are very unrelible for Black Swans and for many events beyond one year and very questioonable beyond five years; laughable beyond ten years. The science of forecasting is too immature for detail prediction. it best to think in general terms and prepare for the certainity and opportunity of Black Swan. Apparently, the author took this tactic as a trader in 19.80's and became comfortably wealthy though he never explain how he exploited a Black Swan.

The authored showed considerable depth in his study of finance, mathematics, and philosophy most of which are well out of my areas of study. He has strong criticism of classic philosophy and the overuse of models as well as the misuse of models for non-routine events. I have to wait to see if the author cited sources or provided footnotes.

Audiobook: The reading was animated despite being a non-drama and had very correct pronunciation of the many foreign words / terms.

Overall, the book is a must buy for students of critical thinking and decision especially those we are in fields where non-routine events can provide great rewards or costs.",1
Erik Schmidt,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,I enjoy creative non-fiction and I love these sorts of topics,"I enjoy creative non-fiction and I love these sorts of topics. This author lost me when he began to admit he was making things up and could offer no good reason for why those inventions were fitting. Instead of listening to a tale from a curious, smart, self-depreciating, cousin this book read like being trapped at a family reunion next to an uncle who spends the whole meal forcefully telling you how he has figured everything out.

Human perception and human understanding has made us blind to the truths that he explains in this book. Once you understand what he has to say, you cannot help but experience a change in your perception of everything around you. The book explains very simply and it does not require any special knowledge or education, either in philosophy or in economics to understand it.",1
mtspace,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Irreverent Romp - What We Don't Know, Why We Can't Know it, and How to Get By Anyway","Taleb's romp through the land of what we do not know, what we cannot know, and how we deceive ourselves into thinking we know so very much more than we actually do is both fun and insightful. He takes observations that he made as a trader and uses them as a launching platform into the many pitfalls and traps we fall into in considering any problem.

I bought this book with Mandelbrot's Behavior of Markets, and for the same purpose. I wanted to get a strong intuitive understanding of the consequences of the difference between the actual behavior (power-law) and the assumed behavior (Gaussian) of markets. I wanted to know what the power-law relationships were, so that I could build my own statistical models. And I wanted an analysis of real data showing that, in fact, markets in question do follow power-law relationships. Were I to rate this book solely on its ability to deliver on these expectations, I would have to give it two stars; for this book has nothing to do with the actual empirical facts. It is, instead, a highly rhetorical appeal to us to use empirical facts in making decisions about the market while it nevertheless manages to completely dodge the task of presenting any real market data.

The inquiry here is much broader. Taleb is painstaking, almost encyclopedic, in his enumeration of ways in which our understanding of information breaks down. He draws on ideas from Greek, Roman, Arab, French, and English thinkers spanning more than two millennia. He also draws from the fine work of contemporaries Kahneman and Tversky which demonstrates how - when guessing about things - we all systematically underestimate our probability of being wrong by about a factor of twenty. He asserts that people with MBA's and those running large financial institutions do so a great deal more than, say, taxicab drivers and trash collectors.

He visits physical models which prove that we cannot know much about the physical world, such as the three-body problem. The point is that when even physical systems that can be described very exactly in mathematical equations cannot be predicted with arbitrary accuracy, what's the hope of predicting things for which we don't even know the variables or the math one might use in describing them? Here he misses some opportunities by needlessly scoffing at the uncertainty principle, and by failing to include comments by one towering physicist of the twentieth century, probably Von Karman*, about how no physical phenomenon seemed spookier - i.e. more difficult to describe accurately using mathematics - than turbulent flow in fluids. This is an unfortunate omission since Mandelbrot actually uses the term ""turbulence"" to describe the fluctuations in market prices of goods and securities.

One reaction to Taleb's arguments about how little we can ultimately know and on what shaky ground our beliefs lie is to stand, like a deer in the headlights, waiting for better information. Taleb argues that this is a mistake. It might be a bit better to proceed, looking for evidence that would prove one's course of action wrong, then modify one's model of reality and repeat the process. Doing this has the advantage that one can learn quite quickly about how any problem is bounded, and get some sense for the shape of the space inside. He quotes Warren Buffet: it is a great deal better to be approximately right than it is to be precisely wrong. And when choosing among things to believe, he advises us to rank beliefs not by their implausibility but by the harm they might cause. Although there are robust methods that draw on both judgments, this is generally very sound advice.

The book is highly irreverent. In financial circles it is seen as blasphemous, not just because it flies in the face of conventional wisdom, but because the author has so much fun demolishing revered ideas. Anyone who can take it seriously and follow its advice ought to be much better at evaluating information and making decisions. This quality gives you a much better chance of becoming rich and famous like Taleb - though as Taleb might explain, there is still a vanishingly small chance of this happening. The down side is that following Taleb's advice is likely to make one a great deal less promotable (especially in financial firms) because - according to Taleb - reaching high levels of a company depends almost exclusively on making others believe you know things about which you are actually completely clueless; and only sociopaths and very self-deluded people do this convincingly.

This suggests that one would read the book for the sole joy of knowing that you're the only person in the room who is sane enough to understand how little you actually know about pretty much anything.

Good Reading

*Taleb makes great use of footnotes, and I recommend reading them all. Some of the best material in the book is in them. Van Karman is most famous, perhaps, for his role in adjudicating what to do after the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge - arguably a Black Swan event. One day not long after this long suspension bridge was erected, it began twisting and oscillating in a 50 MPH wind. Some minutes later it collapsed. Von Karman was called in to evaluate what happened. He told the town council that the vortex shedding frequency of the bridge in a 50 MPH wind happened to closely match the natural vibrational frequency of the bridge. The bridge had gone into harmonic oscillation which created stresses that were much higher than those created by static loads for which it was designed, and this was why it failed. Although it is to avoid collapsing bridges via harmonic oscillation that British soldiers fell out of step when crossing bridges over several centuries prior, the town council had never heard of anything like this happening before. They declared ""It was a very well-built bridge"" and therefore ""we shall build it exactly as it was before."" To which Von Karman replied ""If you build it exactly as it was before, it shall collapse exactly as it did before."" To their credit, they had the bridge re-designed.",6
Faustino,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,A rare event - a mind like mine,"This is a wonderful book for me; over the years I've met few people who think like me, and none in recent years in Brisbane. Taleb resonates: his understanding of the world is based on direct observation and a clear understanding of uncertainty, in a world where people live by rules and expectations which ignore the fact that ""Black Swans"" - unexpected events with major ramifications - dominate history and economics. Taleb derides economists, but I think he's thinking of forecasters. As an economic policy adviser, I have long argued that we don't know what will happen, we need to adopt policies which enable us to respond positively to changing circumstances; not to resist change, which is inevitable and largely unforecastable, but to embrace it. A message little heard prior to this excellent book.",3
Jaewoo Kim,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,The author is a genius who suffers from ADD,"The author's mind, and subsequently his writing, meanders like a hyperactive 7 year old. He talks about everything from wars in the middle east to prostitutes, rats, and investment bankers in Manhattan. Oh yes, he also does talk of swans that could be black, but not before he talks of turkeys and how much a cab driver loved his $100 tip back in the 80s.

I would have given this book one or two stars for its total lack of focus and extremely wordy writing style. But the author is also a undeniable genius and the book has high level intellectual analysis. I just wish the author had taken a pill to calm down his apparent attention deficit disorder (ADD).

The author slams the bell curve (standard statistical analysis) and the standard deviation. He calls them the Great Intellectual Fraud (GIF) precisely because the bell curve takes out the black swans of data. The black swan is an event which is far from probable, but is also far from impossible. Black swans are the extremities of data. Surprisingly, black swans show up far more in our daily lives than the regular statistical analysis would indicate.

So what do we learn from this? NO ONE can predict the future on anything with regularity. Expect the unexpected. Luck plays greater role in our lives than we think, especially when it comes to extremities (extreme wealth, extreme success, extreme failures etc). The information age has brought us even more extremities. If you are not ultratalented and knowledgeable of your craft, then stick to a non-scalable (paid by the hour) pay rate.",3
Eugene Mcmanus,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,What's with black swans?,"Once upon a time, an exercise in logic was the following:

All swans are white.
This bird is a swan.
ergo, this bird is white.

Nobody ever had a problem with this, well, almost no one; some did. Then one day, a discovery was made in the western climes of Australia: there were birds there that looked like swans: large, aquatic, long slender neck, large distinctive beak; acted like swans: swam gracefully in the water, laid large eggs, waddled when walking on land. There was only one minor problem: they were black, not white. This created some problems; first, amongst the experts, who claimed a swan couldn't be black, but had to be white. Next, it completely destroyed the logic exercise mentioned above. It seems the problem was with the experts: they had decreed that swans were white, and now here was a bird in Australia that for all the world met the definition of a swan, except for color. It was a challenge to the experts.

That, in a nutshell, is what Professor Taleb's book is all about: pointing out when, where and how some experts, in this case experts in the financial world, get caught by events that were not expected to occur. The sub title of the book, The Impact of the Highly Improbable, suggests that maybe probability might have something to do with why financial experts get caught with their predictions down: they don't understand probability. The real problem is that no one knows the future, so predictions about what may happen in the future are in fact nothing more than at best educated guesses, as weighted by the probability of the event occurring. There's the rub: no one knows the appropriate probability distribution to use when dealing with the future, and often it's the occurrence of ""highly improbable"" events that rip us up. Hurricane Katrina is an example: a once in a hundred or five hundred year event; and as such caught the responsible officials apparently flat footed. But there are other equally improbable events that occur seemingly every day, like accidentally hitting a thumb with a hammer, and don't create the problems Katrina created. Why?

One answer might be the value associated with the occurrence of the event. For example: a traveler from somewhere arrives in the US, and brings a mild stain of flu, which some of the population subsequently contract. Not much of a problem there. But suppose a traveler from somewhere arrives in the US with a nuclear device. That's a completely different kettle of fish. How, or who, can distinguish the difference in thes two events, untll after the fact?

If' you've ever had a course in statistics or hope to at some time in the future, reading Professor Taleb's book will give you some grist to chew on, to mix a metaphor. Often overlooked is that statistics deals with the past, and probability deals with the future; they're only related by assumptions that we make about how the past s a predictor of the future. And since highly improbable events are, by definition, almost never represented in the statistics, except maybe as outliers, it follows that statistics really isn't a very good predictor of the future.

The book is a good read; hopefully, after reading it, you'll be extremely skeptical of anybody who makes any prediction about the future; including this one.

Oh, by the way: Professor Taleb apparently made a fortune in futures trading, following much of what he talks about in his book: skepticism.",2
Tom T,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,The Black Swan,"My son recommended reading The Black Swan to me. I had no idea what it was about or I likely would not have read a ""financial book"". I am an artist and tend to avoid this type of reading.
Coincidentally, I had just had a negative experience with a financial adviser and found the timing for this book perfect. The Black Swan is an occurrence that has great impact and is unforeseen. It is often what determines the success or failure of the quality of your financial life. That pretty much describes anything in the area of finances that matter.
The book is interesting, but more importantly funny, and easy to read. It is not your typical ""how to"" financial book. Just the opposite, it is a why you should stay away from a financial adviser... book. I learned a great deal and really look at the world of finances and the world in general in a different and a more positive way. This is a great book and I highly recommend it.",4

ImageMD,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,The Black Swan - An Epistemic Fowl,"The Black Swan - The Impact of the Highly Improbable could have been titled The Black Swan - An Epistemic Fowl, but this might have impaired sales. Nassim Nicholas Taleb arrives at his erudite but not arrogant story after a childhood in war torn Lebanon, obtaining a Wharton MBA and years trading on Wall Street. He makes abundant use of these experiences as he weaves a complex story about the importance of these inadequately appreciated rare events to our increasingly quantified and specialized world.

His journey takes us from Plato to Popper, from Gauss to Mandelbrot and from errors of induction to errors of confirmation. An appreciation of epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge) is not required but will make the journey more enjoyable. He sets up a straw horse by showing the inadequacy of the Gaussian distribution to account for events which are several standard deviations from the mean and, therefore, are the events in which we have the least confidence. He offers some hope by using a fractal (power series) model which allows him to transform some of his black swan intractable problems to tractable gray swan problems. However, his analysis is non exhaustive and he does not consider non Gaussian models or discontinuous distributions.

We are left with an adequate argument against Gaussian quantitative models but with no replacement except the traditional qualitative narrative of boom and bust, creation and destruction which has been part of human culture for thousands of years.",3

Mary Wilbur,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,The Skeptical Empiricist,"First I must say that not a little of this book was over my head, at least on a first reading. What I liked most about it was Taleb's unremitting criticism of so-called experts (especially economists), people with a largely or completely academic background and experience, with no experience in the messy real world, who rule Wall Street and I will add government. I'm also inspired to read Karl Popper and David Hume, two philosophers whom Taleb cites favorably, as I have run across them in other works. Lastly, I didn't find Taleb to be arrogant as some commentators have mentioned. He has a healthy dose of self-esteem but is hardly overbearing.",3

Half a decade later is not quite 'the test of time', but the central concept in The Black Swan stood up surprisingly well.

I think his skepticism of current established models and paradigms, for predicting future patterns, is healthy, and something we should all keep in mind in our decision making. Current world events (i.e. Japan, Egypt, and Libya) seem only to underscore the validity of Black Swans. The book is a relatively quick and enjoyable read.",2

Math Enthusiast,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Black Swans in ""The Black Swan""","There are true pearls in this book. Umberto Eco's ""Anti-Library,"" Yevgenia's story, Algazel's rejection of science, ""scalable"" jobs and the antechamber of hope (anyone working one of these jobs will relate strongly), are a few examples. The problem is that they are hard to find and come somewhat unexpectedly, i.e., they are black swans. I think the problem is that the author apparently set out to write some kind of ""treatise"" and felt that the book had to be a weighty 500-page tome, so he had to include a lot of filler. Properly edited, this could have been a delightful 200-page read. Sometimes the author is wrong: for example, he dismisses linear phenomena too casually. It is obvious that nothing is nature is linear, since this would require the response to increase or decrease without bound as the independent variable increases or decreases, which is an impossibility. This is called the ""Law of Diminishing Returns."" The point is that many or even most phenomena behave linearly over a limited interval of interest. For example, a transistor is a linear device if biased (by means of proper voltage application) to its amplifying region, otherwise it behaves as a switch (as in digital devices). The author is prone sometimes to self-aggrandizing, but this is tempered with dashes of self-deprecating humor, making the reading tolerable. All in all, it's recommended.

(Pun intended). It was inevitable that the crash of 2008 would result in publishers printing this sort of pseudo-explanatory pablum.

Mark P. McDonald,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,My dinner with Nasim,"The ideas behind Black Swan are intriguing and interesting. What person would not like to learn how to spot the unpredictable, consequential, and clearly seen once it happens? The funny thing is that Nasim Taleb spends three hundred pages discussing why it is hard, if not impossible to predict a Black Swan. An issue is that Taleb does this using a rhetorical style that is unfamiliar to business books - stream of conscious. You get a delightful mix of well thought out insight, personal observation, pet peeves, and ranting. In that regard I feel that I have now had dinner with Mr. Taleb after reading the book.

This book is rapidly becoming the ""hot"" book for the pseudo intellectuals in business. People sending copies out to others drive sales but do not change thinking or the way people work. As a case in point, I talked with a business man on a plane who was reading this book and said ""I am thirty pages in, and not getting much out of it.""

If someone gives you this book, I would suggest accepting their gift and commenting how thoughtful they are. I would not suggest re-gifting or buying and distributing to other colleagues. If a consultant comes to tell you that they can help you find the next Black Swan be aggressive and point out that by definition they cannot be seen, cannot be predicted, and ask the consultants to put 100% of their fee at risk based on the revenues you will generate from capturing the Black Swan idea. If that does not cause them to run away, then they have either not read the book, or more likely not understood what it says.

This book runs the significant risk of being a nice book for the bookshelf and never read. In that regard it will become a peculiar part of Umberto Eco's library -- a book I have but have not or could not get through. In either case it becomes part of the anti-library in terms of books I have not read. Does that make it an anti-book?

This book is not written, nor edited for that matter, for public consumption. It is a peculiarly academic book from someone who lambastes academia. Unfortunately you need to know a fair amount in order to understand and extract value from this book. For example if you do not know who are Popper, Hayek, Samuelson, Poincare and several other people else you will not understand what Taleb is talking about. He leaves out many people who I thought he would have been a fan of, such as Milton Freidman and others who take a market based approach.

This book is part philosophy, part business and all Taleb. If you are a fan of his great, if you are trying to understand his ideas, then I would look to the article in the New York Times.

The idea of the Black Swan is compelling, easy to understand, and easy to talk about. That is the allure of this book, but that is not what this book delivers. Black Swans are now the rage of the intellectual discussions, dinner parties and a way to one-up each other by being in the ""know"". The irony here is that Taleb goes to great lengths to point out that by its very nature you cannot know, nor predict the next Black Swan.

Feel free to use that as an antidote to the black swan when it comes up at your next cocktail party.",6
R. D. Sanders,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Thought Provoking,"I admit that this book won't win any writing prizes, but I still found it enjoyable and thought-provoking. It is an excellent antidote to the ""blue ocean, search for excellence, how I brilliantly predicted the future and became rich"" line of books. I think some reviewers were disappointed because of their expectations. ""The Black Swan"" is not exactly a ""pop philosophy"" or business book. It isn't a scholarly treatise for Ph.D. consumption, either. That hybrid nature may be the reason for the uneven writing.

Stephen Northcutt,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Tough reading, worth the work","A black swan is a surprising or virtually unpredictable event; that can have a massive impact. Nassim Taleb's observation is that after the fact, we concoct an narrative to explain it. Dangerous behavior at best. Google and 9/11 are black swans according to Taleb. After explaining the narrative is dangerous the author proceeds to deliver 308 pages of it! That is the way this book goes, it is hard reading, words you are not familiar with, jabs at the French followed by text in French, games within games. Yet, there are tons of pearls, as Taleb says, the test of an author is whether you reread his work and I will have to reread this to comprehend more.

A big chunk of the book is describing two subsets of our world are explained: Mediocristan and Extremistan. Mediocristan is the world of the regular Joe, at least most of the time. Earnings are related to the amount of work you do, things are predicable or at least mostly so. You can explain most events with a Gaussian distribution, a bell curve. Extremistan is the world of rock stars, book authors, G- where unfairness reigns, Joanne K. Rowling made several orders of magnitude more money on royalties than I did, the unexpected happens, Black Monday and Tuesday, the stock crash October 28, 29 1987 caused the US Stock market to decline over 22%. If you can describe Extremistan then you do it with power laws and fractal geometry not bell curves.

He challenges our notions about success; some companies and some CEOs that we think of as role models probably just got lucky. This was very helpful for me, I just finished reading Seduced by Success which has a similar message. He draws on his experience as a trader, a quant, in the financial markets and tells the reader in essence, these guys are just guessing. His financial advice is to put about 85% of your investment into something very safe and stodgy like T-Bills and then use the remaining 15% on high risk, high payoff and adjust the percentages based on your risk appetite.

There is a fictional component to this non-fiction book, at one point he is telling the story of a lady author and her paramours and it seemed impossible, it was, she was fiction. Another word picture was a true man of the world (Fat Tony) who had his own social engineering approach to the famous coin flipping problem. The Fat Tony's of the world do not allow even distribution to happen.

People are either going to like this book or hate it, I have a thick skin, I choose to like it, he made me work pretty hard to get through the book, but the mind is a muscle and I for one thank Taleb. I predict statisticians, academics and Frenchmen are going to despise this work.",5

Dan Wallace,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Fresh Skepticism in a New Age,"Taleb's central premise is that we delude ourselves with popular stories, false knowledge, myths, overvalued facts, and the appearance of science. He calls this the narrative fallacy, and counsels, ""The way to avoid the ills of the narrative fallacy is to favor experimentation over storytelling, experience over history, and clinical knowledge over theories."" Good advice.

Given this push for what David Brooks calls ""epistemological modesty,"" you may expect a humble book, -- and if so, you would be disappointed. Taleb lambasts the hubris of Wall Street, yet he is a product of this culture; and the book shows it. His belief in uncertainty combined with his sharp views is broadly ironic. Some reviewers call it arrogant.

I put the bravado aside, and even found it entertaining at times, for Taleb's case is well put, and the book is brisling with thoughtful aphorisms and vivid stories. Here are a few of my favorite lines:

- Luck is more important than skill.
- Risk is the most when you feel the safest.
- Look for evidence that proves your ideas wrong.
- There are no experts of things that move.
- Too much information becomes toxic.
- The wise plead ignorance to world events.
- We cannot compare current reality with an alternative.
- Our highest currency is respect.
- ""Randomness"" is unknowledge.
- Be prepared for multiple contingencies.
- ""I don't know,"" is a sign of intelligence.
- We are swayed by the sensational.
- Seize every opportunity, for they are rare.
- Go to parties -- chitchat leads to breakthroughs.

These are thoughtful nuggets to consider. And despite the pride that occasionally dances on the pages, Taleb is a good writer and an even better philosopher. The book is part memoir, part postmodern treatise on skepticism, part rant. It is an idiosyncratic, fresh and fascinating narrative.

This book is also a full frontal assault on the Wall Street establishment that uses statistics, bell curves and Black-Scholes theory to sell portfolio allocation. For investors, Taleb advocates a ""barbell strategy"" where you put 85-90% of your money in cash or equivalents, and the remainder in extremely risky investments that are scalable. He goes on at some length to talk about the dynamics of scalable investments and scalable careers such as sales, venture capital, and entrepreneurial ventures. In the end, he recommends against entering scalable professions due to the many risks involved. More irony.

For those who do hit it big and make what Taleb calls FU money, he recommends a dedication to scholarship, for he sees the pursuit of money and material goods as a nightmare. And he warns that scalable success may not come for a long time, or it may never come, and sojourners in scalable professions will have to endure the cruelty of critics. This line of thinking feels balanced and wise.

I was fascinated when I read this book in the winter of 2008, partly because Taleb had correctly forecast a major stock market crash, and partly because I had recent experience working as a marketing consultant for a large Wall Street investment firm (which no longer exists). That consulting experience and this book have left an imprint on my mind.

I have not studied Edmond Burke or David Hume, so currently, Nassim Nicholas Taleb my favorite skeptic, and The Black Swan is one of my favorite books.

When Taleb was Tweeting, he praised ""Straw Dogs"" by the contemporary British philosopher, David Gray. Gray's book takes skepticism to new and brilliant heights, and in my option it flies over the top. Perhaps some day I will review Straw Dogs as well, but for now I'll stick with Black Swans.

Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals",103
Greg Linster,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,A Book That Changed My Life,"The polemicist Simon Foucher warned that, “we are dogma-prone from our mother’s wombs.” Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s philosophical work, The Black Swan, is truly a masterpiece that addresses this problem. At one point in the book, Taleb asserts that “the ultimate test of whether you like an author is if you’ve reread him”. Considering the fact that I’ve now read this book twice, it’s fair to say that I greatly admire Taleb’s work. Now on to the review.

***

In “Part 1″, there is an interesting anecdote, that sets the tone for the rest of the book, about Umberto Eco’s library. Eco is a highly respected semiotician, essayist, philosopher, literary critic, and novelist. And he owns a library that reportedly contains over 30,000 books. He isn’t, however, known for being boastful about it. When guests come over to his house he usually gets one of two reactions. The vast majority of guests, according to Taleb, respond with something similar to the following “Wow! Signore professore dottore Eco, what a library you have! How many of these books have you read?” And then there are the people who get the point: “A large personal library is not an ego-boosting appendage, but a research tool.” The point of this story emphasizes a critical theme throughout the book, i.e., we overemphasize what we think we know and downplay how ignorant we really are. An antilibrary (representing things we don’t know) is more valuable to us than are the books we’ve already read (or things we already know).

Early on we also learn that Taleb classifies himself as a skeptical empiricist. And, you may be wondering, what exactly is a skeptical empiricist? “Let us call an antischolar — someone who focuses on the unread books, and makes an attempt not to treat his knowledge as a treasure, or even a possession, or even a self-esteem enhancement device — a skeptical empiricist.”

For further clarification, empiricism is a theory of knowledge, which asserts that knowledge can only be ascertained exclusively via sensory experience. And skepticism, it’s important to note, comes in many different varieties. Taleb traces his skepticism back to its roots in the Pyrrhonian tradition. However, he is also fond of “Sextus the (Alas) Empirical” (better known as Sextus Empiricus) and David Hume. Taleb, however, is not entirely devoted to promoting rampant philosophical skepticism. He simply wants to be “a practitioner whose principal aim is to not be a sucker in things that matter, period.”

Largely, then, this book is about epistemology, also known as the study of human knowledge. What can we truly know? And what are the limits of human knowledge? I think Taleb focuses one of the fundamental problems of philosophy, which the German Philosopher, Immanuel Kant, also wrote extensively about (although from a different perspective), i.e., what are the limits of our reason? Kant realized that examining human reason is inherently problematic, namely because when humans try to examine metaphysical or even epistemological issues we can never do so outside the bounds of our own reasoning ability. We’re suckers, blinded to reality, because we are trapped in our own human minds!

Throughout the book, Taleb picks on the great thinker of antiquity, Plato. Taleb, however, also gives the impression that he is quite fond of the great philosopher too, despite his shortcomings. What Taleb calls Platonicity is the obsessive focus on the pure and well-defined aspects of reality, while ignoring the messier parts and less tractable structure that exist in reality. Perhaps an example of Platonicity might help clear up this distinction. A Platonified economist, for example, thinks that he can accurately model something as complex as the macroeconomy. Using foolish assumptions, the Platonified economist tries to assume conditions of reality (that don’t really exist) in order to fit her model rather than accepting that reality is far messier than the model. One who is a Platonic thinker, then, could also be classified as a nerd. Nerds, according to Taleb, believe that what cannot be Platonized and formally studied doesn’t exist, or isn’t worth considering.

One interesting example of Platonicity provided in the book pertains to breast milk. At one point in time, Platonified scientists believed that they had created a formula for a mother’s “milk” that was perfectly identical to a mother’s real milk. Alas, they could then manufacture this milk in a laboratory and make financial gains from it! Despite what appeared to be an identical chemical composition, there was empirical evidence showing increases in various cancers and other health problems in children who drank this fake-milk. Was this a coincidence? Perhaps. But it also could be that the Platonified scientific formula for milk was missing some crucial element of the milk that we cannot see!

Platoncitity can further be generalized as follows, “it is our tendency to mistake the map for the territory, to focus on well and pure defined “forms,” whether objects, like triangles, or social notions, like utopias (societies built according to some blueprint of what “makes sense”), even nationalities. “ In other words, a Platonified nerd is someone who visits New York City, but has with a map of San Francisco with them, and yet still thinks that their incorrect map will somehow help them. Taleb believes that we have a built-in tendency to trust our maps, even when they’re for the wrong location. Furthermore, we fail to realize that no map is often better than the wrong map.

The trouble is, according to Taleb, that we encourage nerd knowledge over other forms of knowledge, especially in academia. Nerds focus on what fits in the box, even if the most important things in life fall outside the box. The nerd simply neglects the antilibrary.

At one point in history it was considered “knowledge” that all swans are white. This was stated as a scientific fact because no black swans had ever been observed. However, this line of reasoning presents an interesting philosophical problem, i.e., “The Problem of Induction“. And the great philosopher, David Hume, wrote in great detail about this problem, although he wasn’t the first to do so.

In order to further understand this problem let’s consider the following classic inference that led to the problem: All swans we have seen are white, and therefore all swans are white. The problem is that even the observation of a billion white swans does not make that statement unequivocally true. This is because black swans may exist, we just haven’t observed one yet. We have obviously since discovered that black swans do indeed exist. What can we learn here? An over reliance on our observations can lead us astray.

Still confused? Then, let’s consider what we can we learn from a turkey, which hopefully provides further clarification. The uberphilsopher Bertrand Russell illustrated this turkey example quite well.

Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race “looking out for its best interests,” as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving it will incur a revision of belief.

Taleb, then, states, “The turkey problem can be generalized to any situation where the same hand that feeds you can be the one that wrings your neck.” Probably the most important point to note from the turkey is that our perceived knowledge from learning backwards may not just be worthless, but rather, it may actually be creating negative value by blinding us to future events with dire consequences.

As such, it’s certainly important to note that a series of corroborative facts is not necessarily evidence. But where does that leave us in terms of how we can know things? Well, Taleb further argues that we can know things that are wrong, but not necessarily correct (think Karl Popper’s falsifiability). This he calls negative empiricism. The sight of one black swan, then, can certify that not all swans are white, but the observation of a trillion white swans doesn’t give us any certifiable claims.

Strangely, however, we humans have a tendency to ignore the possibility of silent evidence and look to confirm our theories, rather than challenge them.

One of the central tenets of the book is the distinction between “Mediocristan” and “Extremistan”, which are terms for different types of domains.. When you’re dealing with a domain that’s in Mediocristan, then your data will fit a Gaussian distribution (a bell curve). In Extremistan, however, you’re not dealing with data that is normally distributed. A single observation in Extremistan can have an incredible impact on the total. Think of the following example. If we took the average height of a million humans and then, say, added the tallest person in the world to the sample, the average wouldn’t be affected in a significant way. Height is normally distributed. Now imagine we did the same thing with wealth. Adding the richest person in the world to a sample of a million people would greatly affect the average. The distribution of height, then, falls within the domain of Mediocristan and things like wealth in Extremistan.

One of Taleb’s main points is that we often try to use the model that works in Mediocristan in Extremistan. Taleb states, however, that almost all social matters belong to Extremistan and that the casino is the only human venture where probabilities are known and almost computable. But even casinos aren’t immune to Extremistan — think about it.

Another interesting concept from the book is the “toxicity of knowledge.” Too much information can be toxic especially when it inflates the confidence in an “expert” prediction. More information is not always better; more is sometimes better, but not always. And we often blindly listen to experts in fields where there can be no experts.

If you follow Taleb’s argument, then reading the newspaper may actually decrease, rather than increase, your knowledge of the world. The Black Swan, however, will not only increase your understanding of the world, but it will make you wiser as well. For that reason, I can assure you that I will be rereading this book yet again at some point in the future.",3
Rick Sline,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,There's a reason this is required reading by Amazon senior management,"I was fascinated by the book on first reading and like another reviewer would like to read it again to pick up on some concepts, but not sure that I will anytime soon. I came to this book by a comment made in the recently published Amazon/Bezos biography “The Everything Store”.

As a Director of Clinical Data Management and Programing at a medical school, I am very sensitive to improper analysis, faulty assumptions and the host of issues like narrative fallacies. Some years ago and without knowledge of this book’s contents I came up with my own versions of two of the important points in the book – 100 coin flips coming up mostly heads and wrongly assuming variances in continuous variables are Gaussian distributions.

I was somewhat turned off by Taleb’s continuous knocking of Nobel awardees, although a point once made would have been fine.
This work reinforces other critical works including “Wrong” and “Inviting Disaster: Lessons From the Edge of Technology”. At this point I’ve come to the conclusions – not necessarily original thoughts that:
• Planning is useful for evaluating options, plans “don’t survive the first contact with the enemy”
• Unexpected things will always happen; one can’t predict what’s going to happen, only something unexpected will happen.
• Experts are frequently wrong – some have no intent to deceive and others are following their own agenda",3

Jon Thomas,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Read the Reviews But Do Read the Book,"Do not let some of the negative reviews deter you from reading Nassim Taleb's book. I found the book to not be overwhelmingly long--barely over 300 pages--nor was I terribly put off by his writing style. It is true that he is not the most perfectly elegant of writers, but I read his two books primarily because I was interested in the content of his ideas--not his style.

It is also true that NNT is not overwhelmed with a sense of his own humility. Even, apparently, his mother is aware that fact as he points out in this book. He is what he is and you need bear with that fact if you want to read the book. I might add, though, that if you stick with the book to the end, he rather humbly thanks the good reader for completing the book. If you think about it, all of us have moments of arrogance mixed in with moments of humility. Nassim simply has a bit more arrogance than the ""norm""--not that he would necessarily admit to a ""normalized"" distribution of arrogance in the human population. I might be mistaken, though, perhaps he would....

Humility is a funny commodity. Years ago I heard of what I thought was a wonderful anecdote about the former Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir. Mrs. Meir was presiding over the cabinet meeting and was listening to an excessively long declaration of modesty by one of her ministers. She admonished him something in the following fashion: ""Why don't you shut up? You are not great enough to be humble.""

NNT directly attacks the mathematical and statistical methods utilized by the economics and finance communities for analyzing risk. He makes the case that the methods used are highly inappropriate for developing reasonably accurate models of risk. He is far from being totally against the use of mathematical methods for the assessment of risk, only that they be intellectually honest mathematical models that own up to the high degree of uncertainty inherent in economic and financial data. The black swans are always with us and no amount of computer generated Gaussian statistical models can eliminate those basic unpredictable events. He takes the position that these communities need to ""move on"" and find less inaccurate and more honest predictive models using mathematical methods that abandon ""excessive precision"" (or rather inaccurate ""precision"") with their forecasts. He suggests that Mandelbrotian fractal methods might be the most fruitful methods to pursue in the future for building investment risk assessment models.

He has a rather skeptical turn of mind on most issues. Montaigne, Poincaire, Keynes, Hayek, Popper are all thinkers that he appears to greatly admire and to have very largely influenced his thinking as he explains in this book.

His advice to the great unwashed of us inhabiting ""Mediocristan"" is to invest 80% to 90% of our savings in US Treasuries, CD's, municipal bonds, etc. Minimize your risk to negative black swans--e.g., stock market collapses, etc. The remaining 10%-20% you can ""gamble"" with if you so desire. You still maintain your security nest egg while looking for a possible big pay off. For the high risk 10%-20% ""investment,"" look for black swans whose probability of occurring may be misvalued by the markets. Then bet against the ""conventional wisdom"" and see if you can score the ""big payoff."" If high risks bets do not appeal to you, keep all of your savings in the relatively secure investments of US treasuries, municipal bonds, etc.

Seems like sensible advice to me. Read the book, see what you think.",3
mostserene1,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Probabilistically Addictive!,"The Black Swan is one of those landmark cross-disciplinary works that should be read by all people interested in deepening their knowledge of our understanding of reality and the distortion of reality by cognitive and emotional biases. In a quirky, anecdotal, highly idiosyncratic style, the author describes how most people make flawed decisions by incorrectly understanding probability and risk. He explains our tendency to err in thinking, whether in the voting booth, in making investment decisions, researching scientific discoveries, or purchasing a car.

Of course it is one thing to understand on an intellectual level cognitive and emotional biases and another to be able to remove or neutralize them. Take, for example, confirmation bias, which is when we tend to reject information that does not support our dearly held view/theory/argument. Easy concept to comprehend, tough to incorporate into everyday thinking, especially when it is OUR beloved view/theory/argument that some pesky piece of information undermines. Critical thinking requires considerable effort and practice. Such books as The Black Swan make this rather enjoyable.

In short: The Black Swan is a rarely occurring, high-impact book that shakes the pillars of social, political, and economic orthodoxy. Highly recommended.",3
Individual Investor,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Don't let Taleb's annoying asides stop you from reading The Black Swan,"Taleb could use a good editor, no doubt about it. Taleb's writing can be very entertaining and informative when he does not distract and annoy the reader with childish throwaway asides. On the other hand, these asides act as road-signs: When you find one aside too many, just skip the rest of the chapter because it is of no major consequence. When Taleb takes to his subject, he writes like an adult. :)

The subject matter, which could have been covered in fewer pages, is about the fact that the normal or bell curve does not represent reality in many cases and in these instances predictions based on a normal distribution will be wildly wrong. I found particularly helpful some pointers about our understanding of issues like ""evidence"" which may or may not prove your assumptions and ""randomness"" (not what you learn in a casino) which may be Gaussian or not.

The rest of the book is dedicated to various subjects such as the history of the Levant, not to be confused with the Middle East; a diatribe against the Nobel prize for economics; the academic pecking order; Taleb's travelogue including Rome, Paris, Sidney, Boston; and praises for philosophers and mathematicians Taleb happens to like including Mandelbrot and Poincare.

The reason for reading this book, if you are an investor, is to make sure you adapt your portfolio to the reality of Black Swans and avoid wrong assumptions and bad theories such as MPT, Black-Scholes, and Efficient Markets. If you are not highly leveraged then Black Swans will be less traumatic for your portfolio. Maybe Taleb should have railed against excessive leverage.

While Taleb does mention his dumbbell style of investing, don't expect to find an investing tutorial. He provides some clues but you will have to create your own unique style of harnessing good Black Swans and avoiding the bad ones.",1

K. Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Modern Dictionary for Life,"""The Black Swan"" is Monumental. It's needed to remind us of what we often forget and over-look in life. Too many facts and concepts in this book to list. You can read the ""The Black Swan"" in any order, and the sub-chapters within the main chapters are also mini-chapters, which can be read in any order. You can do this by using the Index to find the concepts and topics you want to learn about. Many reviews are about the concept of the Black Swan itself, Medicristan and Extremistan. Below are a few of the other things noted.

Linear vs. Non-Linear:

With linearities the relationships between variables are clear, crisp, and constant. But Taleb notes quite accurately that non-linear relationships in our world are far more common. Unfortunately, we humans are programmed for many reasons to incorrectly think the world's non-linear phenomena operate in linear fashion. Also, in our education system we focus on linear relationships because they're easier to understand.

A few of the many points by Taleb:

OSTRACISM:

""A school allow someone with unusual ideas with the remote possibility of a payoff to find company and create a microcosm insulated from others. The member of the group can be ostracized together - which is better than being ostracized alone"" (p. 94).

TREND FORECASTERS: Get Another Job.

Taleb accurately claims with empirical evidence that forecasters are usually wrong, no matter who they are, and no matter what their erudite and expertise background is. How right he is. He accurately cites that forecasters are entertainers. And most, charlatans.

To Quote: ""Do not listen to economic forecasters or to predictors in social science (they are merely entertainers)....know how to rank beliefs not according to their plausibility but they the harm they may cause"" (p. 203).

And most importantly, Taleb notes that in regard to Black Swans and future trend forecasters that ""Knowing that you cannot predict does not mean that you *cannot* benefit from unpredictability"" (page 203).

HUMANS FEEL THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THINGS THAT ARE NOT UNDERSTANDABLE:

It's OK not to understand or not know about many of the phenomena in our world. But we humans do try to ""explain"" many things in our world and universe that are not explainable. Under the Black Swan mentality, it's OK not to now. It's OK not to understand. When it comes to the concept of Uncertainty, that's OK, too.

INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS I LEARNED:

* a 'googol' is the number 1, with 100 zeroes

* 'bildungsphilisters' are people who read dogma-prone newspapers and go to operas who have cosmetic exposure to culture and are shallow. They are learned philistines. This can include those in academia. They have the Ph.D but lack erudition, and their curiosity is closely centered on his/her ideas. p.131

In my opinion this book is a classic for modern times. We are bombarded with tons of information by ""experts"" on a daily basis. Experts explaining the present, past, and predicting the future. The medium on this superficial level is the Mainstream Media. At the esoteric level, it's university experts. They are both more same than different, in general.

One of the hundreds of quotes in ""The Black Swan"" is the point that: ""knowing that you cannot predict does not mean that you cannot benefit from unpredictability."" I and most readers, have experiences this, small and big.

A Classic.",2
D. B. Collum,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Shoot the Messenger not the Message...,"This book had not risen to the top of the stack on my night stand until Mr. Moto murmured something about its importance. My lack of enthusiasm emanated from ""Fooled by Randomness"", which I thought was an exceedingly useful concepts but stiff, poorly constructed prose.

So what is my conclusion? First, the complaints. The prose seems to have improved but not as dramatically as Mr. Taleb seems to think. I find his writing style ponderous (maybe pretentious is better) and the evidence of bloated self-esteem inescapable. He ain't James Grant (which I am reading right now), but he doesn't know it. I also had the same gut response as I had to ""Fooled by Randomness"": He seems to circle. (This is more common in books than I ever realized; it must be part of efforts to fill the right number of pages, or somethin'.) He is a student of many things but less of a creator of the ideas than he thinks (again, IMO.) The reason the arrogance catches my eye is because he is hurling stones (legitimately) at others while unknowingly sitting in a glass house. (He breaks his own covenants in interviews, for example.)

With all that said, ""The Black Swan"" really is a must read and was very enjoyable. He is a student of history, philosophy, psychology, mathematics, and markets. He brings these together (along with copious name droppings of intellects from the ages) to tell a compelling story of how rare events are common and consequential. In essence, there are so damned many rare, unknowable events that they hit us every day. He scorches Gaussian mathematics. The notion of a fat tail is dismissed as nonsense because he dismisses the curve on which the tails are supposed to reside. Gaussians kill. He really does a nice job of explaining why we are so prone to missing the consequential stuff. Our profound need to tell a story that makes sense regardless of its correctness--the narrative--plays prominently. The notion that you cannot see Black Swans coming but you can position yourself for the unknowable is a critical theme. I would phrase it something like ""You do not know if or when an avalanche will commence, but you do not have to ski there."" (He, BTW, would call such an avalanche a grey swan in that it could be anticipated at some level.) The anecdotes are cute. At times I could not quite get his drift (snowbank). Overall, however, even concepts that I understood have been annealed in my brain.

Now, having completed this assessment, I read what others said. Some things caught my eye, such as reference to ""the authors repetitive discussion of his theory"" and ""smug tone of the authors words."" I was a little surprised by how the idiosyncracies that I picked up seemed to way heavily on the readers comments.",1
P. Rank,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Read the book for the philosophy of risk,"I consider The Black Swan one of the most influential books in my life. I reread it several times, and each time I discovered some nuances relevant to whatever I was working on at the time. The book is truly timeless.

The Black Swan does not teach you *what* to do. It crisply describes the concept in the Introduction and then presents this concept from different angles -- many angles, widely different angles, with philosophical, historical and personal narratives behind them. Some reviewers here find this approach repetitive or verbose. I think such criticism is misguided. If all one wants to know is the Black Swan concept, the book is not necessary. Reading reviews (including some Amazon.com reviews) would suffice.

The problem is that knowing the Black Swan concept is not enough. The nature of Black Swans is such that it is impossible to provide a concrete advice for what to do about them. A Black Swan is an event that catches you completely unprepared and leaves you affected for life. A short book could pursue one of the two venues. Either it would proclaim that any resistance is futile and we are doomed. Or it would concoct some protection against Black Swans and try sell it to gullible readers. An intelligent book should, on the other hand, provide the reader with all relevant information and teach him to face the unforeseen.

And so Taleb describes Black Swans from the historical, philosophical, social, medical, biological, scientific, economic, personal, and other points of view. As soon as you internalize the Black Swan principle, you start seeing Black Swans everywhere. This is not an optical illusion; it is a removal of a long-engraved blind spot. Over the years Taleb has collected a wealth of the Black Swan evidence; in the book he shares his findings so that the reader can recognize Black Swans, too.

Taleb does not ""train"" in Black-Swan avoidance; he ""educates"" about their habits and known manifestations. When the book finally gets to you, you become highly skeptical about every major aspect of your professional and personal life. You become less idealistic but also more wise and alert. This could not be achieved with mere recital of facts; this was possible through innovative metaphors, original narratives and reinforcements of the key principles. Dealing with the Black Swans requires openmindness and the book opens one's mind.

Buy this book for the wisdom you will gain from it, for the deep appreciation of the things that we just don't know, for the Aha moments on virtually every page.",2
Bas Vodde,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Wonderfully rude book,"Black Swan by Teleb is a wonderful rant about randomness and how that concept is misunderstood in the world causing enormous harm. The central theme of the book is that most non-natural elements do not follow ""the normal distribution"" but that a lot of predictions are made based on the assumption that they do. Instead, the distribution is 'fractal' which can cause extreme outliers which are outside any model. These outliers are per definition unexpected and Taleb calls these Black Swans.

The book consists for 4 different parts, of which part 1 and 2 contain the main message and 3 and 4 are clarifications on that. The first part explains the concept of unexpected events --Black Swans-- and why we aren't able to predict them and our inability to realize this. It describes several fallacies that humans commonly follow which flaws their thinking. The second part takes this further and takes a bunch of philosophy and history to show that humans never have been good at predicting the future and what the reasons for that are. Here it also takes stabs at professions that do predict the future and basically calls them frauds. The third part has chapters clarifying his earlier statements and trying to give some useful advise on what else you can do. The last chapter is an ending chapter with concrete advise on how you can change your attitude taking the Black Swan into account.

I found Black Swan a wonderfully rude and controversial book, claiming that a lot of the world-as-we-know-it is flawed and explaining why. It is definitively insightful and I loved the arrogant attitude the author has towards his subject and the related (un)science. I did find the book hard to read at times and repetitive. From that perspective, it isn't a book I'd recommend everyone to read, it isn't exactly light reading either.

All in all, I did enjoy the book and was thinking about giving it five stars as it is definitively different (at least, for me, especially not having read his earlier work yet). Based on the editing and the not-to-easy-to-read-ness, I decided to scale down back to four stars. Still, a fun read!",2
Suzan T,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"quirky, informative, and very entertaining","I found the book to be quirky, informative, and very entertaining. Yet, Mr. Taleb seems to fall into the trap of what he himself calls, epistemic arrogance and confirmation bias, especially when it comes to his vehement rejection of the causal aspect of history. Plus, though I haven't read his earlier works, I found his scope for randomness in this book to be very large.

As far as style, Mr. Taleb, who calls himself NNT in the book, has a definite personal voice in his writing, and I think he is obsessive compulsive with regards to the book's structure; with his elaborate, detailed table of contents, his frequent references to later chapters, and his redundant anecdotes/parables (a bit of narrative fallacy there). But I think that this all adds to the charm and humor of the book, and makes it a fun read even for a non-economist, non-trader, non-expert, non-scalable mediocristani like myself. I could imagine meeting him a party. Chatting with him would, no doubt, be fun and maybe a little annoying. Then I would move on to, say, a psychologist who is really into Karl Jung.",4
Jeffrey E Ellis,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Throw away the bell curve.,"THE BLACK SWAN makes a single salient point: the future is largely shaped by the unexpected and unpredictable. And that thought, as simple as it is, is profound.

For many years, swans were, by definition, white. But that paradigm was shattered when a black swan, a highly improbable event, was discovered in Australia. The black swan is Taleb's proxy for the unexpected.

In America, for example, the events which have shaped our lives; the Great Depression, WWII, the JFK assassination, personal computers, 9/11, were unpredictable but changed our world forever. It is the unforeseen, not the expected, which rocks our world.

In the securities industry, there is an axiom which the law requires be disclosed to each public investor: Past performance is not indicative of future results. In other words, the unexpected happens. And yet, as a culture and as an investing public we often view the future as an extension of the past, earnestly expecting tomorrow to be much like yesterday. Why? Because most of the time, it is. And then, a black swan emerges and changes everything.

The quality of writing is uneven and in places, tedious. I find it a bit hypocritical, too, when foreign authors deride America (and our cultural idiosyncrasies which they don't understand) but certainly enjoy the wealth and fame our free markets create for them. Nonetheless, Taleb scores his central point and gives us all reason to pause and consider the black swans of our lives.",2
Steven Chambers,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Required Reading for insight into how the world works.,"This book was on my reading list for quite some time but I never found the time to get to it. With all the financial turmoil going on over the past year along with the seemingly flawed decisions being made to fix it I finally felt the need to push it to the front of the list. I was really glad I did.

It is not the easiest read and at times NNT (as he calls himself) can be smug and self-congratulatory, but understanding the information inside is priceless. Randomness is all around us and needs to be factored into our decision-making and thought processes. Much of the theory we use in everyday life is just plain wrong. The book does a fine job of explaining ""Black Swans"" and why it is so important to take into account their possibility.

Bell Curves don't work in a lot of situations and making Gaussian assumptions can get you into trouble in many fields of thought and business. Taleb is right on target in dethroning the many Gaussian Assumptions we find people making in modern life. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is a classic example. His insights provide all the evidence I needed to reject this badly flawed investment model, which NNT exposed as the sham it is. MPT never made sense when I was in business school and now I know why. Based on unrealistic and bad assumptions it never seemed to work in practice as well as it did in theory (it suffered from the Ludic Fallacy as explained in the book...confusing real life results with the results provided by flawed models and games). His discussion on this alone is reason enough to tackle the book.

Well written, entertaining and educational, I consider this book required reading in these turbulent times. Highly recommended.",1

I appreciate his dedication to skepticism - I'm a bit of a sucker myself ... something I'm working on - but he takes it too far at times.

I did end up finishing the book, and though I found it a frustrating read, I'm glad I read it. The thing you can't really get around is that he's just so right, and has the track record to prove it.

I'd especially recommend the book to people starting to think about investing for the first time. You won't find any concrete advice in this book, other than ""don't take advice from anyone"", but there are some very large and important concepts that Taleb gets into that really expand your viewpoint.",6
Weijenberg,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Knowing for sure you can't see into the future!,"This book is not about birds. It is about things that are very, very hard to preview because they're so unlikely to happen, as in sinking of the Titanic.
These things (happy accidents also) are called black swans. This writer had made a thourough study and found: black swans are everywhere. Misjudging situations, excluding the impossible keeps haunting us and after reading this book, you will see that black swans will be a permanent part of our lives. Projections deep into the future, they are in vain. Along flies this black swan and your world is changed forever. I really studied this book, for it made me look different at a whole lot of situations. Being aware, it made me accept, instead of fighting the improbable, impossible outcome. The wealth of real life, often hilarious, examples makes reading easy. It's like a novel, a wonderful gathering of thematic stories, excellently written. Madame Curie once said ""We fear the most what we don't know"", this book confronts us with the notion that we'll always be in that situation of uncertainty. But then again this book takes away the fear-factor and lets us deal with this problem.
For such a complex subject to describe, the author has done very well to keep the tone light, the language understandable, once started you can't stop reading.
We all should read stuff like this, to handle or be prepared for these unusual birds that fly along in this more and more complex world of ours.

Gordon Prince,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Our assumptions about life are more fragile than we think they are,"Unforeseen events keep having enormous impacts on all our lives. Yet human nature is such that we do not learn that this is true. We continue to project the present into the future, are jarred by an unforseen event, rationalize that we should have seen that coming, then resume projecting the present into the future.

The author asserts that
1. we don't learn that projections of the future are unreliable, and
2. we don't learn that we don't learn item 1.

Considering these ideas during the month since reading the book I have seen many projections of the future that I'm now sure are, in fact, worthless. Predictions about the economy, climate, health, war. All the big things, all unknown to all, all events that we find comfort in defering to expert prognosticators on. All events that the expert prognosticators have been wrong about in the past. Yet we keep listening to their predictions and acting as though their predictions have any meaning.

The book is full of examples I remember living through. And I wondered why I didn't seem to learn from my experiences. But that's the point of the book.

So read the book, laugh along the way, and use the author's insights to help take a step back to gain another perspective on how fragile our assumptions about life are.",1
Ken Coffman,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,A Thrilling Ride,"This book was a real thrill for me...with perhaps as much influence on my thinking as when I read Atlas Shrugged in my twenties. For a fifty-five year old curmugeon, that's saying something, isn't it? First of all, I've read the one-star reviews and I agree, Dr. Taleb is very self-absorbed. So what? Up front, he admits that his book is part memoir. If you want a dry economic treatise, there are plenty of other books to read. Go read Samuelson and Nordhaus again. Who's stopping you?
I was entertained by Dr. Taleb's flights of fancy, but that's not what hit me upside the head. For my whole career, I've resisted detailed planning and forecasting, and now I know why. I don't live in Mediocristan and I don't want to live there. I thought there was some missing piece to my intellect or that I am simply lazy. But, I hate the nonsense of forecasting. Passionately. I always felt it was better to go into a project with open eyes and be ready for things to go wrong or right and take advantage of the opportunites. I think I understand a lot of my success in life. I prepare, work hard and roll with the punches. If you're happy in a cubicle playing with numbers in a spreadsheet and prefer to think of the world as linear and Gaussian, then that's great. You'll hate this book and you can add to the many bad reviews. You'll be in good company. Baaaa.

Tom K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"On Average a 4, But the Best Insights are a 7/5","Before the banking crisis and stock market meltdown, the author came close to supporting the extreme view of quality guru Dr. Deming, that the most important things are ""unknown and unknowable"". Instead, he says that we average humans, the learned class and even the PhD quants on Wall Street, really have no good way of estimating, describing or evaluating extreme events that do not fit within the 95% limit of the typical bell curve. The biggest impact comes through breakthroughs, catastrophes or non sequitors. Paradigm shifts, quantum leaps, disasters, perfect storms, revolutions and crowd behavior can be studied, described and analyzed, but they cannot be predicted quantitatively or qualitatively. Their impact is even more difficult to predict, especially in the short-run. Hence, we should not be fooled into thinking that portfolio theory and hedges can eliminate most risk. It remains intrinsic. The author advises that individuals and investors should look for the unusual or outlier risks which can be identified and hedge against them as possible and preserve resources to invest in opportunities when game changing events do occur. This is an eye-opening book, which every investor, inventor, politician and entrepreneur should read.",2
nafrica,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,A philosophy from statistics,"This is a very fun book to read. Taleb is one of those polymath writers who are totally unashamed to bloviate and utterly convinced he's right (and is willing to call Nobel laureates frauds). I give him credit for making statistics engaging to read and a philosophy to boot.

My one criticism is his chapter on narrative fallacies. One of Taleb's arguments is that we should avoid seeing patterns in the past and that the past is almost entirely unexplainable and irreducible with respect to causation. He then applies this to history. I think Taleb's dead wrong here. It is absurd to think of history without thinking about causation and narrative. History is not naked chronology, as Taleb seems to think, but understanding reasons, causes. People don't want to know what happened, but why it happened. This is a valid question! IMHO, Taleb's argument about randomness and skepticism applies only to economic variables. And it's a good point. In sum, I thought Taleb's romp through the world of economics and forecasting was fun and thought-provoking.",1
muddy glass,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"those whom the gods would destroy, they first make proud","ego. it seems difficult to discuss ""the black swan"" without at least a mention of taleb's ego. while i personally don't take offense at the author's sense of self-worth, i can see how some readers' aversion to taleb's personality could carry over into their assessments of his books. however, it would be a mistake to put too much emphasis on the arrogance of others. don't lose sight of the ideas. in my opinion, ""the black swan"" is not as monumental as its author would believe, but it is certainly worth a read and does contain some thought provoking threads on the role of uncertainty in our lives.

a black swan is a highly improbable event of extreme impact that appears obvious and explainable in hindsight. psychological tendencies blind us both before and after the appearance of the black swan, making the black swan hard to predict beforehand, yet making it appear plausible through our rationalizations afterward. this is a story about human limitations in interpreting information; this is a story about epistemology.

as an example of a black swan, consider the death of a chicken which has been consistently fed every day by a farmer, viewed from the perspective of the doomed fowl. (those familiar with philosophy will recognize this example as russell's chicken.) taleb repeatedly reminds the reader that black swans are not objective events and care should be taken to consider who is the ""sucker"" when discussing black swans. death by the farmer's hands may come as a complete shock to the chicken based on the chicken's observations every single day of its life, but the wringing of the chicken's neck is not at all surprising from the farmer's perspective.

taleb attempts to make the concept easier for a wide audience to understand through the use of the metaphor of mediocristan and extremistan. roughly speaking, in mediocristan, deviations from the average are not large enough to seriously impact the average when notable deviations do appear in new data. in extremistan, the deviations from the average are large enough for a small number of sizable new measurements, even a single one (the black swan), to significantly skew the average. the measured heights of a population is a topic that belongs in mediocristan, while the wealth of that same population belongs in extremistan. in more formal language, mediocristan is the realm governed by normal gaussian probability distributions and the results that come from using bell curves, while such mathematical tools fail in extremistan. it is the use of tools from mediocristan when one is really dealing with a situation in extremistan that causes blindness to black swans. it is the chicken's belief that each day's events couldn't diverge too much from the uneventful past that caused the chicken to so completely misjudge the farmer's benevolence.

the black swan plays a huge role in the financial markets, where fortunes are won or lost by the appearance of statistical outliers. wall street has an entire army of financial analysts and programmers whose work depends on a foundation from mediocristan. economists and finance professors are in the same boat. yet, empirical data doesn't seem to support the hypothesis that these tools are even appropriate in this setting. (mandelbrot does an excellent job explaining why these tools are inappropriate in part one of his book ""the misbehavior of markets"" if you're not convinced by taleb's presentation; i read mandelbrot before taleb so i was already familiar with the message going in.) it seems remarkable and absurd to me that so many people can ignore the empirical data and just go about their affairs in the dark like this, especially when they are surrounded by this data every single day at work. however, as upton sinclair wrote, ""it is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.""

taleb deserves credit for attempting to get more people to open their minds to the existence of black swans and to protect themselves from these events as best they can. where he goes wrong is that he overreaches. taleb relates black swans to almost every subject under the sun, and while the connecting of the dots is interesting, frankly, this enterprise just doesn't seem ready for prime time. it also doesn't help that taleb seems to misunderstand some of the topics he writes about, especially when he talks about math and science.

for example, on p.55 taleb writes that ""mathematicians will try to convince you that their science is useful to society by pointing out instances where it proved helpful, not those where it was a waste of time...owing to the highly unempirical nature of elegant mathematical theories."" this is simply an erroneous understanding of mathematicians. first and foremost, mathematicians are interested in the beauty of mathematics. applications to society are secondary, and the pure mathematicians don't even consider the social utility of their work at all. see for example g.h. hardy's book ""a mathematician's apology"" that is representative of this attitude. imagine my surprise when taleb later quotes from hardy's very book on p.240 to contradict himself 185 pages earlier! another example, on p.287 taleb writes that he finds ""it ludicrous to present the uncertainty principle as having anything to do with uncertainty"" since taleb believes the future positions of subatomic particles are gaussian in nature and as such average out by the law of large numbers. he further writes, ""can someone explain to me why i should care about subatomic particles that, anyway, converge to a gaussian?"" it doesn't seem like taleb really understands quantum mechanics enough to be writing about it. in reply to taleb's question, i offer the phenomenon of quantum tunneling as a counter-intuitive example with both theoretical appeal as well as useful engineering applications.

in attempting to make his point of view seem grander and more original, taleb also changes the names of various well-known concepts. for example, the aforementioned heisenberg uncertainty principle is called the ""greater uncertainty principle"" in taleb's book. in place of ""survivorship bias,"" which is quite standard terminology, taleb instead writes of the ""casanova effect"" and ""silent evidence."" readers familiar with physics will also recognize the ""anthropic principle"" from cosmology when taleb discusses casanova. it is helpful to use a different label when there's a significant twist or other insight, but new labels are more harmful than not when the underlying concepts are essentially unchanged.

overall, taleb is a colorful author whose personality is intimately woven into the narrative. this has the effect of making the book easy to read while also exposing various weaknesses when taleb walks into territory he's under-prepared to travel. however, these criticisms are not enough to negate the greater message. ""the black swan"" and his earlier book ""fooled by randomness"" clearly demonstrate that taleb understands the main problem with treating the world as if it were entirely tameable with our comfortable statistical toolkit. nevertheless, focusing on the author's personality is what draws many readers away from the real message of the book, and taleb carries some of the blame for that, though not all of it. this missing of the mark also shows up in the recent ""occupy wall street"" protest movement. wall street professionals can make a lot of money using a faulty understanding of how the financial markets work, underestimating risk, yet get the american taxpayers to socialize the losses when the black swan does show up. this is fundamentally unjust, but that message too is similarly pitifully lost in the focus on the protestors themselves.",1

Bobby Matherne,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Abruptly appearing, totally unexpected events which have a great impact on the world","""All swans are white"" was an unassailable truth up until the discovery of Australia — it was something everyone knew to be a fact. But it was neither true nor a fact. All it took was the sighting of one black swan in the new southern continent to turn the Old World upside down on its head. Taleb, a cagey Lebanese-born philosopher and thinker, has grabbed onto the ""black swan"" as a synecdoche for an abruptly appearing, totally unexpected event which has a great impact on the world, but for which the world conjures up ex post facto explanations which makes it all sound reasonable and predictable. Sure, antiseptic procedures for doctors sound reasonable today, but the black swan Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was imprisoned in a mental institution by the head of his hospital, even after his procedures had saved over a hundred-thousand women in Vienna from dying in childbirth! I have made a vocation of seeking out such black swan innovators, both those like Semmelweis whose contributions grace history books and some whom I have been fortunate to meet and or converse with, such as Immanuel Velikovsky, Richard Bandler, John Grinder, Joseph Newman, Andrew Joseph Galambos, Doyle Philip Henderson, and Kaisu Viikari. Those that I have met only through books constitute a longer list, and I will mention their names in case you wish to look up their contributions as outliers in their unique fields of innovation and discovery: Alfred Korzybski, Rudolf Steiner, Gregor Mendel, Owen Barfield, Anastasia, Barbara McClintock, Carlos Castaneda, Jane Roberts, Thomas Kuhn, Paul Watzlawick, Gregory Bateson, Richard Feynman, Robert Axelrod, and Thomas Paine, among others. It is only fitting that I add the author of this book, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, to the list of black swans I have met through books because his coined phrase black swan will echo down the halls of time, much as Tom Kuhn's word paradigm which he rescued from obscurity and pumped new life into in 1962.
In New Orleans in the Fall of 2005, my wife and I lived through the Black Swan known as Katrina. It appeared overnight and left in its wake a devastated metropolitan area. How did we react to Katrina? We restored our home on the West Bank and our fourplex apartments in New Orleans. I had ridden out Hurricane Betsy about 40 years before Katrina and seen the devastation left behind then, and I had heard of the Great Flood of 1927, about 40 years before Betsy. Knowing something about batting averages, it seems to me that the City of New Orleans needs a catastrophe about every 40 years. The first generation after the catastrophe remembers it and expects another catastrophe like it every year. The second generation only hears about it and never expects one, but the new third generation forty years later gets shook up by a new and unexpected catastrophe and the cycle starts over. I doubt that Taleb would accept my simple baseball metaphor of batting average for predicting a city's experience with catastrophes, but I offer it in the absence of any other explanation. It can bring a certain measure of comfort to those who might otherwise spend Spring through Fall of every year worrying about another Katrina.
Here's how Taleb describes the dynamics of Black Swans and what might qualify as a Black Swan:
[page viii] Just imagine how little your understanding of the world on the eve of the events of 1914 would have helped you guess what was to happen next. (Don't cheat by using the explanations drilled into your cranium by your dull high school teacher.) How about the rise of Hitler and the subsequent war? How about the precipitous demise of the Soviet bloc? How about the rise of Islamic fundamentalism? How about the spread of the Internet? How about the market crash of 1987 (and the more unexpected recovery)? Fads, epidemics, fashion, ideas, the emergence of art genres and schools. All follow these Black Swan dynamics. Literally, just about everything of significance around you might qualify.
This combination of low predictability and large impact makes the Black Swan a great puzzle; but that is not yet the core concern of this book. Add to this phenomenon the fact that we tend to act as if it does not exist! I don't mean just you, your cousin Joey, and me, but almost all ""social scientists"" who, for over a century, have operated under the false belief that their tools could measure uncertainty.
Taleb's forté is the world of finance and economics, and his advice is that no advice from anyone can predict Black Swans. He even gives you a way of discovering this truth he offers, an operation that many of you can easily perform to ascertain how oblivious the best informed experts in the world are to Black Swans.
[page xviii] . . . the applications of the sciences of uncertainty to real-world problems has had ridiculous effects; I have been privileged to see it in finance and economics. Go ask your portfolio manager for his definition of ""risk,"" and odds are that he will supply you with a measure that excludes the possibility of the Black Swan — hence one that has no better predictive value for assessing the total risks than astrology (we will see how they dress up the intellectual fraud with mathematics). This problem is endemic in social matters.
Do you begin to feel as if a rug has been pulled out from under you, causing you to lose your level of comfort in the world? If not, you have not yet understood the problem, and you may gently pull yourself away from this review, dear Reader, and return to your favorite illusory world where Black Swans don't exist, where the world is uniform, slowly changing, and where manufacturing gasoline pumps will always be a prosperous business to invest in. You and I live in a world where no Black Swan will suddenly pop up to make oil a useless black goo best left underground.
Taleb begins the meat of the book talking about Umberto Eco's Antilibrary, which he defines as the unread books on the shelves of Eco's 30,000 volume library, the research volumes. Like my visitors, people would come into Eco's home and notice the size of his library and ask him how many of the books he's read, as if that were the sole reason for owning a library, to read every book. That concept of antilibrary goes to the heart of Taleb's profession as he deems himself to be a skeptical empiricist.
[page 2] Let us call an antischolar — someone who focuses on the unread books and makes an attempt not to treat his knowledge as a treasure, or even a possession, or even a self-esteem enhancement device — a skeptical empiricist.
Before we actually reach the first page of Chapter One, we know all about Taleb in a thumbnail sketchy way so that we are well-prepared for the main course which will flesh out the menu explanations he has shared with us during his impressive Prologue. I don't know about you, but I wanted to order and digest every meal on his menu and was well-satisfied with my dining experience with him as I closed the book.
I cannot tell all the many things I learned in this book, nor do I intend to try. We live in a world full of people who believe that eventually computers will figure out everything and predict everything which is going to happen. These are people who have not read or digested the material of this book, which is indeed an eponymous Black Swan among books and as such will likely be unread and misunderstood when read. Gregory Bateson, a Black Swan among thinkers and an eminent cyberneticist, was asked once by a student, ""Professor Bateson, how will we know when computers have reached the level of human intelligence?"" Bateson thought for a minute and answered, ""We will ask the computer a question, and it will answer, 'That reminds me of a story.'"" As Taleb writes on page xxvi of his Prologue, ""Ideas come and go. Stories stay."" Computers will never answer any questions with stories, and thus will never provide anything lasting, but Nassim Nicholas Taleb has provided a monument to his skeptical empiricism which will stand for all time to come. He explains to us what it means to be human in an inhuman world and how to survive given the reality of Black Swans. To learn more you can read Bobby Matherne's DIGESTWORLD Issue#11c.",1

J. Edgar Mihelic,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,This book is amazing.,"I read and enjoyed this book a while back, but I neglected to review it. My thought was that it was far enough in the product's life-cycle that whatever can be said for it, good or ill, had already been said.

I am writing now only quickly to say that this book is amazing. While my marginal notes show that I didn't completely agree with Taleb's method or conclusions, this book has amazing impact. I am, even at my young age, pretty ossified in my positions about how the market works for all participants. What this book did is make me reevaluate those positions that were once set in stone. I have to admit, this is no easy task. I even sought out, and bought (though not yet read) the book that was the biggest influence on Taleb, The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence. I look forward to seeing the basis for the thought in The Black Swan.

I advise you to purchase this book to help you reevaluate your views on the market. Even if you don't agree with him, Taleb's book will make you stronger by forcing you to engage with his mode of thinking. I write this because I came across an unexpected and unqualified endorsement by another respected radical thinker: Daniel Kahneman in his recent Thinking, Fast and Slow. It seems counter-intuitive at first, but both men are in the same project but coming from different angles: How does the market fail, and why.",1

Yes, we all know that large unexpected events can change everything. But do we act like we know it? Do we insure ourselves in some way against 1929-type crashes? Few do. Why? Because we don't fully understand and take seriously the nature of the Black Swan -- the large, unexpected event.

Thus, the market crash of 2008. We are swayed by a number of fallacies that human thinking is subject to, like buying the ""story"" (the latest fad in thinking like ""Nobel Prize winners have developed the math model that shows sub-prime mortgages are safe."")

Yes, the book could have been written more clearly and in a more neutral style. True, one must take action when faced with uncertainty, something Taleb doesn't focus a great deal on. And I've not read ""Fooled by Randomness,"" so can't judge the amount of overlap. But developing deep understanding of common fallacious lines of thought is priceless. That's what ""The Black Swan"" helps one with. Yey, Taleb! Your excessive ego is totally justified!",1

Steven Peterson,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Nice thesis, but its development could be improved","While reading Taleb's ""The Black Swan,"" I cannot be as excited as many of those who see this as a breath of fresh air, as a new way of looking at things. The central point being made by Taleb is quite on target; there are unpredictable events that can occur that simply cannot be anticipated or predicted. We are too often overconfident in our ability to predict and try to shape the future. But I do have questions about his book. First, his thesis is hardly novel. Robert Nisbet (a social scientist, a species of being beneath contempt in Taleb's universe) said essentially the same thing over thirty years ago (Quoting from his ""The Year 2000 and All That""):

""It is very different with studies of change in human society. Here the Random Event, the Maniac, the Prophet, and the Genius have to be reckoned with. We have absolutely no way of escaping them. The future-predictors don't suggest that we can avoid them or escape them. . . . What the future-predictors. . .say in effect is that with the aid of institute resources, computers, linear programming, etc., they will deal with the kinds of change that are not the consequences of the Random Event, the Genius, the Maniac, and the Prophet [which sound like black swans to this reader]. To which I can only say: there really aren't any; not any worth looking at anyhow.""

That's the basic point of Taleb's book, so he's not exactly breaking new ground. Taleb says on page xxvii that he's sticking ""my neck out"" to claim that ""our world is dominated by the extreme, the unknown, and the very improbable. . . ."" What sticking out his neck? A well regarded academic said much the same thing thirty years ago and, to the best of my knowledge, Nisbet wasn't perceived as ""sticking his neck out"" or punished for his apostasy.

Second, his presentation misses the point on a number of matters. He mentions the punctuated equilibrium approach to evolutionary change. This view contends that there is stasis over long periods of time and then a quick burst of evolutionary change. Taleb focuses, in this book, on such punctuational events. However, most of the time, there is stasis. We cannot simply ignore what is normal over long periods of time and only focus on those rare black swans that transform things. Take elections. For a period of time, there is predictability in electoral and party dynamics. Then, every so often, for reasons that can't be predicted beforehand [a black swan event], the electoral and party system changes in a relatively short period of time. Does that mean we should ignore ""ordinary politics"" associated with ""calm political periods""? No, that's absurd--but that's also Taleb's argument. We should ignore ""central tendency"" (in statistical terms) and only consider outliers (extraordinary events)? That doesn't make much sense.

He also cites people who actually undermine some of his arguments. Kahneman's work on cognitive biases is very important and supports well the book's argument. But Taleb cites (but does not discuss in detail) Gigerenzer, who argues that heuristics and cognitive biases, as a result of evolution, are very accurate, contrary to Kahneman's work. Since Taleb cites Gigerenzer, he ought to note that the latter's view of cognition moves in a different direction, in opposition to the book's thesis. In contradiction to Taleb's discussion on pages 81-82, Gigerenzer argues that intuition is at least as valid and accurate as the cognitive, thinking system.

Third, as a number of reviewers note, there's a lot of anger in this book. Sarcasm and venom directed at entire professions based on an isolated anecdote here or there seem to run against the author's own arguments about how we ought to make decisions. In Kahneman's terms, Taleb falls prey to the ""representativeness heuristic"" [overgeneralizing from small sample sizes], falls prey to the ""availability heuristic"" [using whatever vivid examples come quickly to mind, such as the dopey political scientist wed to game theory--as if this justifies dismissing the entire discipline from one example], and he obviously falls prey to ""confirmation bias"" since he does not challenge his own thesis and try to falsify it but focuses instead on providing evidence to support his perspective [RIP his devotion to Karl Popper]. His snide dismissal of thinkers like Wittgenstein tends to be theater with little substance. If you want to trash someone, provide some reason and logic for doing so. And while I agree with many of Taleb's criticisms of thinkers and systems of thought, I am unimpressed with his snide put downs that don't advance understanding.

Fourth, he tends to set up ""straw men"" and then demolish these. For instance, he criticizes planning. The idea of planning covers a lot of territory--from the old Soviet plans to strategic planning. The former? His analysis is right on. The latter? If done well, strategic planning is a boon for an organization and he is not accurate in his judgment. His statement on planning is so broadly stated that it becomes close to meaningless.

In the final analysis, the author advances a provocative and useful thesis. Black swans are important factors in change processes. How we humans deal with the world tends to make us oblivious to rare and unpredictable events and their consequences. Very good points. However, this is hardly a unique insight. And the supporting logic and rationale is sometimes not so compelling; a focus on the outliers and an exhortation to ignore the routine is unconvincing. His style of argumentation by dismissal rather than by addressing concrete ideas and theories with which he disagrees is not helpful. So, it's an intriguing book, but it has problems that the reader needs to evaluate.",21

Dr. S. P. GREINER,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,The Black Swan and What's Wrong with Nassim Taleb's Viewpoint,"I'm 94 percent through reading Nassim Taleb's remarkable book about random events having higher than expected occurrence throughout history. I'm an unusual reader however in that many of the people he's met, read about and formed friendships with, I've also had the opportunity to meet, read about or write to. Being the ""loner"" that I am however, unlike Mr. Taleb, I didn't form friendships with these guys. Didier Sornette and Benoit Mandlebrot are two of his hero's if I can use poetic license, whose works I've followed throughout the years and as an applied scientist working first in the aerospace and auto industry, and now in finance, have had a chance to apply their work and ideas to real world problems. However, I've also been a student of Newton, Kelvin and Einstein all of whom would and did make room for the ""Gaussian"" curve that Mr. Taleb has disgust for. I would also fall into one of Mr. Taleb's cohorts with whom he has high disdain, since I also was educated in physics and mathematics in the usual academic curriculum. This being the case, I feel I have some credibility to offer a secondary review of his work having used the tools of ""Extremistan"" as he calls it.

To begin, there are many statements in his book that I agree with. The Nobel self-congratulatory awards, the assertion of many academics to request a mathematical proof of his ""theory"", the view that mathematics exists only in the mind for nature offers neither a true square, diamond, or triangle, the lack of an explanation for the observation of highly probable events and his continued persistence that an explanation isn't necessary are just an example of his high intellect that in the ""real world"" we all come to appreciate and assume some brotherhood with this smart-alec of a man. However, there is clearly a mischievousness in his demeanor that snickers at anybody who disagrees with him that is uncalled for. This appears as high arrogance that rightly his mother ascertained from his character when she said to him, ""if you can get people to pay you what you think you're worth, instead of what you're really worth, then you've got something"".

Let me make a thoughtful empirical criticism which underpins Mr. Taleb's ranting and raving in the book. Mr. Taleb says on page 281 of the Black Swan, ""you need one simple deviation to reject the Gaussian, but millions of observations will not fully confirm the validity of its application. Why? Because the Gaussian bell curve disallows large deviations, but tools of Extremistan, the alternative, do not disallow long quiet stretches"". His overall argument fails on this one simple account: there are more than one cause in effect for almost all known observations of any phenomena in the universe. What's typically done in physics is to attempt to understand the strongest influencers of an outcome, not ALL of the influencers of an outcome. He fails to understand that it's not one distribution or one cause in effect, but always multiple causes occuring. Extreme events have a different mechanism that triggers cascades while every-day events, those occurring that aren't extreme have a separate cause. One only enters into the conundrum of explanation when you try and link all observations, both from his world of Extremistan and Mediocracistan together into one cause. This is never the case in any phenomena I've ever dealt with or heard about, from weather forecasting, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, chemical kinetics, or the financial markets. There are competing effects going on, not just one. Some trigger daily and can be observed regularly, some trigger every 100 years or more.

Take for example his principal teacher of Black Swans, the financial markets. Okay, so thirsty bubbles, credit crunches, LTCM, October 1987, August 2007 occurred and weren't explained by the ""Gaussian"" model. Well, for ease of explanation, say there were two underlying distributions with two completely different mechanisms involved. One cause of market movements say, results in a distribution of returns modeled like a Gaussian and the other cause, is best explained by some distribution that has extreme tails, infinite variance and allows for discontinuous jumps. I have yet to meet a physicist or mathematician who wouldn't agree with this and it satisfies Mr. Taleb's points exactly. What he fails to comprehend I believe, is that multiple causes are in effect simultaneously in any problem I've ever encountered, each resulting in its own distribution of outcomes. What's not separable and creating havoc in explanation, are the multiple causes that create the underlying distributions and/or which cause has what distribution?

As a practicing computational and modeling scientist since 1987, I see Mr. Taleb's book as delightfully playful, but certainly amateurish. His understanding of science is quite ignorant really. I was amazed at the name dropping, though he continually disavows making a habit of it. And why Mr. Taleb can't see to find anybody but Herr Dr. Professor Mandlebrot to agree with him is beyond me? Perhaps the physicists he did find who agreed with him, weren't quite as famous as they needed to be, to be quoted in his book. Lastly, being a student of history that Mr. Taleb purports to be, I was amazed he didn't dig up these two quotations, one from the supreme empiricist Isacc Newton and the second from the best theorist I know, Albert Einstein:

Thus far I have explained the phenomena of the heavens and of our sea by the force of gravity, but I have not yet assigned a cause to gravity. I have not as yet been able to deduce from phenomena the reason for these properties of gravity. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy.
I. Newton

Newton forgive me; you found the only way which in your age was just about possible for a person with the highest powers of thought and creativity. The concepts which you created are guiding our thinking in physics even today, although we now know that they will have to be replaced by others farther removed from the sphere of immediate experience, for we know that science cannot grow out of empiricism alone.
A. Einstein

I would say that one can't predict extreme events so one doesn't model them generally. It's not a failure of ""modelers"" as Mr. Taleb suggests, but of tackling simpler problems first. We didn't throw Newton out when his laws failed to account for relativistic velocity; we shouldn't throw Markowitz, Merton, Sharpe, Black and Scholes out either for their early contributions. Sure, they'll be overtaken by Rachev and the Levy-Stable distribution function but in 1968, who could compute a numerical basis function on a piece of paper since computers were hardly around! The Gaussian was used simply because you could compute it; it had a closed form analytical equation.",10

George Zarkalis,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Some interesting ideas, oversold and maybe underestimating the intelligence of the average reader","I had great expectations from this book.
At the beginning it was quite interesting presenting some intriguing ideas (although nothing really new).
The main idea is the existence of rare events which are disproportionately impactful and usually out of our prediction horizon. Also that there are situations in which the classic bell curve doesn't apply.
However the writter over-analyzed the particular ideas, and in several cases led himself to the other extreme allowing the notion that nothing is predictable and that his famous Black Swans (these rare events - usually due to lack) make all the difference.
He failed to demonstrate proportionately that two different ways of thinking are necessary.
Eventually he used an own example of a fictitious person and his own experiences trying to make his point - which, again becomes misleading and leads him to a similar mistake that he accuses others of.
I believe that eventually he falls to the same mistakes of methodology and thought that he so much tries to teach about.
All the above plus his arrogant approach lead me to rate the book with only two stars. I would rather recommend somebody to read an abstract keeping always a critical/skeptical approach for the reader. It's just ideas - not evidence.",12
InterLinkOperator,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Power laws and fractals and wild randomness,.. Oh my!","Sorry to say, we are ""probably"" not in Kansas anymore. Taleb is a modern day Renaissance man. No, not the Hedge Fund run by Dr. Simons. I enjoy catastrophy, chaos and complexity theory. I have read and enjoyed his prior book Fooled by Randomness. Mandelbrotian fractal geometry has some fascinating self-affine insights for market analysis. Name something manmade which we have more quantitative data on and understand so unpredictably as the stock market. Except that, over time, it trends upward. Ideas, innovation, new technology and bounded rational actors are prime drivers into the unknown. But what about the unknown-unknown shocks, these are the nongaussian Black Swans. Not impossible but not anticipated either.

Interestingly, he is of Greek Orthodox descent, from the Levant in Lebanon, with exposure to polymath Jesuits. After 9/11 he was called upon to conference about asymmetric threats and found military brass had a better grasp of wild randomness than pedantic-academics.

Risk is often inaccurately assessed or quantified and at times is unknowable. Current gaussian models exclude outliers: crashes and exponential breakouts to the upside. The best example for me is HOLX, Hologic. What Peter Lynch would call my 24 bagger. Who knew? Taleb warns me of success bias leading to the belief that I can pick another like it. After reading Taleb, I was just lucky. Upside reward is not accurately represented by the gaussian nor is downside risk.

Study the Subprime effect on supposedly uncorrelated markets. The debate over liquidity, credit, risk transference, gaussian mathematical models, tight coupling of financial vehicles (SIV and CDO) is apt. Events like this probably not only make Taleb smile, but wealthy. Read Bookstaber on the hedge funds role in this.

But, even ""simple minded"" investors like Warren Buffet (positive outlier that he is) can make money, slowly, and in the worst of markets. Ultimately, I think, that is Doctor Taleb's (grey) swan song.

Nassim Taleb may at times wax tangential, but, I am pleased to have added this book to my collection on stocks, markets and risk in general. As a student of biology I like his reference to the black (and grey) swans with their popperian implications.

All in all a good read, worth the risk of capital. Check out Fooled By Randomness first.",3

Piggy_Chusky,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"good read, interesting arguments but a bit naive","i read both books by mr. taleb (black swan and fooled by randomness) last week. i enjoyed both, although i think he made the point about the futility of inductive reasoning more persuasively in the randomness book. both argue the same point with different emphasis. in black swan, he even undertake a bit of advising, akin to list of things to do so that you don't get harmed by black swans.
often, but not for too long, i get exasperated by his desire to grind an ax: his constant put downs on economists, mba's and journalists. i can see his point that math has a lot to teach to those ignorant of subtle complexities of probability theories, but the pompous (but quite entertaining) name calling is just not necessary. having said that, he did toned down a bit in the black swan book, so if you prefer something more spicy, read the randomness book first.
mr taleb has done a good job at presenting an interesting hypothesis, i am waiting for his scholarly works to prove he is not just exercising litearary rights to fill his pocket the lazy way.
things to watch for: when he goes over how useless econmists are, he makes broad assumptions about the neo-classical econ approach. this shows that he is rather naive of this ""soft"" science. one point in case, there is this concept called opportunity cost, it matters when making rational decisions. he just ignored it or perhaps was not aware of its central role in how economics study the world. simlarly, we all know that models make assumptions, some are more extreme than others. they serve a purpose, benchmarking. no one expects to find a perfectly competitive market (i think there is one close to it, the commodity market), but that is NOT the point.
in sum, highly enjoyable book. taleb is at his bests explaining intuitively statistics. does a good job in criticizing inductive reasoning, but a terrible job at justifying the put downs on economics.",2
Winston Kotzan,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,A cunning stab at the uber-geek's mathematical models,"The Black Swan is one of the best critical thinking books I have ever read. Taleb uses the analogy of a Black Swan to symbolize his thesis - that significant, but unexpected, events occur and determine history, but we are blindsided by these events because our minds are fixated on the status quo.

With the knowledge that the dinosaurs had, could they have ever imagined getting wiped out by an asteroid impact? Who would have guessed that the transistor, invented in the late 1920s, would cascade to the invention of computers, the Internet, and the way we share information. Such events are Black Swans.

The elusive thing about the Black Swan is that they are difficult, if not impossible, to accurately predict. However, Nassim Taleb does his best to examine the scenarios that brew Black Swans and uses an interesting array of terminology such as ""Mediocristan"" vs. ""Extremistan"" to describe where Black Swans are likely to occur.

The most interesting part of Taleb's thesis are his explanations for why we are so shocked when the Black Swan arrives. He does an excellent job analyzing the way we are trained to think; our minds are so wrapped up in the status quo and the information we have that we tend to forget about the unknown unknowns.

Taleb examines how our minds naturally fall victim to fallacies such as statistical biases and what he calls the ""ludic fallacy"" of mathematical modeling. These fallacies cause us to overlook the big picture and miss the devastating Black Swans lurking.

I was happy to finally see someone with the guts to attack the academic means of thinking with a structured, rational argument. He vigorously discredits the eggheads who try simplifying the real world such as the stock market into their mathematical models. (Remember, these are the same eggheads who put together Long Term Capital Management.) Among the flawed models he points out is the Modern Portfolio Theory, which is taught to MBAs around the world, but is almost never practical.

References to ancient philosophers and every day news events keep the book interesting and give it a worldly sense. Taleb's terrific tongue-in-cheek humor makes it entertaining as well. You won't regret delving into this intuitive and practical new chapter to critical thinking.",3

Talebs confidence in his own ideas helps him write a book which is easy and fun to read. For an economist, interested in the philosophical background of the science, he offers plenty of very interesting references. I will most certainly dig more into the thoughts of Karl Popper and Benoit Mandelbrot.
But Taleb's confidence also helps him make several rather banal mistakes. His main adversary is the statistician Gauss and his normal distribution. Taleb is right that many economists and financial analysts rely far too much on normal distribution. But figure 7 on page 238 reveals that Taleb himself does not understand the concept pretty good: ""..as your sample size increases, the observed average will present itself with less and less dispersion"".
His confidence also makes Taleb jump to conclusions and make banal errors (the French Maginot Line, the main line of defence built in the 1930s, was not built where the Germans attacked France in World War One). Taleb even goes in his own primary trap: the confirmation bias. Every little thing happening by chance is counted as evidence of his Black Swan theory. But the story of penicillin is famous just because it was sensational, not because it is the normal way of making major medical breakthroughs.
It is probably not worthwhile to read this book, although there are grains of gold in it. The book is written in the spring of 2007, before subprime. In a footnote Taleb is writing about the risk of Fannie Mae: it ""seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite."" Touché!",6

He attacks economics and economists for their heavy reliance on mathematical techniques that bear little resemblance to reality. He nicely shows the ridiculous assumptions made by economists, giving an example of a Nobel laureate whose model didn't match the facts. But since the model used elegant mathematics, he received the Nobel.

However, too often he says it's relatively straightforward to prove blah blah blah, but then doesn't. We're supposed to take it on faith that he's got some proof for his claim.

Gregory Gilman,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,A towering intellect and an even more towering ego,"The most predictable thing about events in this world is that they are far less predictable than we think. That is the thesis of this book. Most people reading this review will have heard that Nassim Nicholas Taleb is one of very few people who predicted the recent financial meltdown and made money betting on it. Only a small portion of the book is specifically about financial matters. Nevertheless, an understanding of the concepts here is essential for anyone hoping to understand the recent financial carnage. And yes, making a remarkably accurate prediction is an ironic way to gain credibility for a message about the futility of prediction.

For centuries all swans were believed to be white and every known observation of a swan had served to confirm this belief. Then a single observation of a black swan destroyed that theory. This principle is known to philosophers as Hume's problem of induction or Popper's falsification principle. It is known to investors as the fine print in the prospectus that says, ""Past results are no guarantee of future performance."" Taleb would prefer that this warning was taken out of the fine print and printed bold on the cover of the prospectus.

This book seeks to answer the question: How do we make decisions when faced with opacity of information on which to base those decisions? Taleb concludes we simply convince ourselves to be more certain than we have any objective right to be. The reasons for this have deep roots in evolutionary psychology. We prefer information that conforms to our biases. We prefer anecdotes over scientific statistical analysis. When we attempt scientific statistical analysis, we chose tractable models and mistake the model for the far less tractable reality. We respond to even the most unpredictable events by quickly convincing ourselves (with the benefit of hindsight) that they could have been predicted and we won't fail to do that next time.

Taleb convincingly shows that Bell Curve statistical analysis is vastly overused in situations where it is not just useless but dangerous. Usually this is done by confident, overpaid ""experts."" Using this model where it is not appropriate dramatically under predicts the likelihood of rare events. Even worse, it dramatically under predicts the impact of these events. A trader can lose a life's savings in an afternoon using the same methods that brought him a lofty income for many years.

In place of the Bell Curve, Taleb advocates the mathematics of Mandelbrot for studying most social and economic phenomena. This will yield far fewer firm predictions but a much better appreciation of risk. Attempting to find some examples of where the Bell Curve may work, he cites mortality and crime rates. This may be a rare case of him being too generous with his foes. History is replete with pandemics and societal breakdowns that blew up longstanding mortality and crime patterns.

Taleb aspires to be viewed as a big league philosopher. His biggest fear seems to be that he will be viewed as just a successful (or worse - lucky) trader. He is the type of polymath that you almost never see anymore in this age of hyper-specialization. While few of the elements he uses originate with him, there is some important and creative synthesis here. He effectively draws on philosophy, psychology, history, the mathematics of Mandelbrot, and his experience as a trader, in support of his thesis. Despite a showy vocabulary, he never hides behind jargon. He has a genuine talent for making technical ideas accessible to a general audience.

The book is marred by Taleb's incessant name dropping. He is very intent on establishing that his sensibilities in all things scholarly and cultural are unrivaled. Perhaps this is true. Even so, many readers will find it tiresome being reminded of it on every page. He admits to sharing the same psychological instincts that make us all bad risk managers. It's just that, his tone would indicate that, in himself, these are charming eccentricities while in others they are contemptible weaknesses. Like his hero Popper, Taleb preaches epistemic humility even as he is short tempered with all who challenge him. These flaws did not detract much from my enjoyment of the book but for others they will. How can you tell which group you are in?

One of the many relevant psychological principles Taleb cites is confirmation bias. I was inclined towards his ideas before I ever picked up the book. I had already concluded that most of what passes for economic prediction is useless - or worse. And that watching CNBC can only make you dumber.

If you are inclined to believe that events are inherently predictable and that corporate risk managers make their companies safer, then you probably won't like this book. On the other hand - if you believe we have often been sold a bill of goods by ""experts"" in the prediction business - then you are likely to find this a useful and satisfying read.",4
Gerry,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Cognitive Dissonance,"I gave this book a 4 star rating but I really wanted to give it a 3.5 star rating. That is not an option however, it must be a result of the Gaussian hegemony. I say 3.5 stars because the import of the subject matter is definitely deserving of 4 stars but the presentation was only worth 3 stars. I found myself very interested some of the time and bored or confused the rest.

The author insinuated often that the individuals who are users of standard statistical analyses are morons. While I do agree with him that the statistical methods used in industry are deeply flawed, especially since they are, almost all of the time, manipulated by bias (intentionally or unintentionally), I disagree with his assertion that a new form of analysis will be immune from manipulation. There is no question, however, that this perspective on random events is very deserving of focused study.

Being a metallurgist, I don't deal with statistics often, but I'm very interested in seeing the results from investigation into this type of thinking. I think it has great merit and will benefit our understanding of the things around us.",1
F. J. Molz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Are Black Swans Everywhere?,"I found ""The Black Swan"" by Nassim Taleb to be fascinating. One reason I was interested in reading the book is that something appearing to be analogous to ""Black Swans"" (i.e., rare and important events) may be found in turbulent flows and in the heterogeneity (extreme variability of certain physical properties) in natural sediments. Just as with Taleb's applications to economics and politics, scientists are attempting do describe the statistics of the variability using non-Gaussian, stochastic fractal, concepts. Some type of mathematical/physical chaos seems to underlie all these phenomena, which results in unpredictable behavior with a deterministic component. Taleb's book ""The Black Swan"" does a superior job of explaining and illustrating the basic ideas using economics and politics, topics with which many people are familiar.",6

Rafael Bernal,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Interesting ideas. So-so exposure,"Dr. Taleb has a mostly interesting and ammusing exposition of some very important ideas around unexpected events (black swans), but his way of trying to explain how these events work is rather obscure, at least to me, since I'm acostumed to clearer, somewhat more scientific or mathematically oriented books. I believe Dr. Taleb spends a lot of time going around the point instead of just explaining why he proposes what he proposes. The ideas, being really interesting, deserve a more scientific/mathematical and clearer explanation. In the end, though, he presents ideas that are worth reading about.",1
Carolyn Thornlow,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,You have to work to separate the wheat from the chaff,"There's no doubt that Nassim Taleb is a brilliant man. And, there's no doubt that he is frustrated by having to work among people who don't get it. What is there to get? Simply that the quest for certainty -- through mathematics, science or other logic disciplines -- may end up being the very thing which obfuscates the truth; that we end up not being able to see the forest for the trees. I think what he is saying is that there can never be certainty; that there will always be Black Swans...random events.
The reason why I say ""I think"" that is what he is saying is because there is so much stuff here -- a lot of which is totally irrelevant. He talks about his home town, seemingly just to wax nostaligic, though he may use the vignette to talk -- belaboredly -- about a point. Among the other stuff he presents is: an unusally high regard for the French language; too much - again irrelevant - reference to and back-story about thought leaders, and; palpable disdain for some colleagues in the quantitative field. If you can get through all of that and hold on to the nuggets, though, you will see some fresh thinking. Just his distinction between 2 different systems of thought is worth the work required. There are other presentations which may shift the way you think about things, too. In the end, it's worth reading, but you will have to focus on what's important because he doesn't.",19
Rewrite,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Fascinating and revolutionary ideas,"I found this book to be one of the most fascinating books I have read recently, and I have been reading a lot of similar books. I will not summarize the book here -- you can read one of the other 479 reviews for that. Suffice it to say that Taleb presents new and fascinating ideas that I had never heard before and backs them up with logic and evidence.
Some complain about Taleb's tone, that he sounds smug or angry. I was a little taken aback by his tone initially, but after a while I found it refreshing. It wasn't pandering or condescending. If you are the type of person who limits your reading by the tone of the messenger, this book is probably not for you. But if you are open-minded, this book is well worth you while.
This book was life changing for me. It has changed my thinking about a lot of different things. As an economics major, I am even more suspicious of economists. More importantly, I have recently retired and have a large amount of my money in a 401k. I always agreed with those who said the stock market was the best place to put your money because it has historically always out performed all other investments over the long term. I now realize that perhaps I am being a turkey and have changed my investments.",3
John Ogden,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Thoughtful lessons - for investing and for life,"This is Taleb's follow up to ""Fooled by Randomness."" I found the lessons of both books to be important and instructive for both investing and, more generally, for life. Just like a Black Jack player who overvalues results (""lucky"" or ""unlucky streaks"") and not the quality of play, Taleb teaches the philosophy of focusing on making the right probability-adjusted decision. Moreover, he teaches to evaluate decisions (your own or those of others) based on the info at hand at the time of the decision. It is easy to judge a decision based solely on results, but that is misleading as it does not account for the potential events that could have occurred but did not.

I found Taleb's philosophy compelling. Also, his direct, no-holds-barred conversational style is easy to read. He does ramble in places as he hammers certain points home. This is not necessarily elegant prose. However, the points are important and overall this is entertaining and instructive reading.",2
andrew nelson,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Confusion between Chaos and Probability in Complex Process Perception,"I like book overall, especially when the Author degrades those ""minds"" that cannot see the so-called anti-fragility (or maybe chaotic)vents. Some of these events will be stable systems, and persist over time. Others will be transitory and therefore will be unstable systems, coming and going out of existence.

I think it all boils down to escaping from our rigid and static philosophic language and allowing for the ability to perceive the underlying process-oriented systems of our world.

Patrick M,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,One insight and many iterations of it...,"Probable events occupy our minds. Improbable events (black swans) are oft-ignored, yet can have huge impacts on all of our lives. That is the insight of this book. Hardly seems worth an entire book, unless the black swans are coming to get you, and me, and thee. Then it might be worth a read.

Statistical improbability is clear: the needle differs from the haystack. A big event can be rare and widespread -- think of a tsunami, a market crash. By their very nature, these events are not factored in, as we go about planning our daily lives.

This book argues that this aspect of human nature is a form of ignorance. That these rare events occur in a quite regular fashion, a few each generation, and more are coming, as our society grows in complexity and unpredictability.

Therefore, if we accept the idea of a black swan, we can calculate strategies, hedges, which protect against them. If one bad hurricane hits your hometown every thirty years, then at age 30 you need to buy hurricane shutters.

In that this insight should inform investors, Presidents, home builders, and insurance agents, this book is valuable. Rather than relying on our gut instincts, we need to seek the counter-intuitive. In that the author tries to be folksy and is instead sort of smug (his snide aside on Bergson for example) and sort of irritatingly repetitive, a reader will begin to wish this was a long New Republic article instead of a book.

(As a final comment, a reader begins to slowly sense that the author is not adequately representing the statistical sciences, and their take on the unlikely. There is a sense that what is being attacked is statistics 101, and maybe statistics 301, and not anything more complex than that... almost as though his insights must be claimed as unique in order to validate his book sales strategy, and that perhaps a few counter-texts are being over-looked here? That wouldn't be too improbable now, would it...)",7

M. E. Llorens,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Review of the second edition: When is the ""Black Swan Cookbook"" coming out?","I admit it: I am a ""Black Swan"" groupie. Maybe I'm one of those people who heartily express their agreement with Taleb and then go back to applying the same flawed models ""made in Mediocristan"" to illuminate our way through Extremistan. But I still delude myself into thinking that the book had a profound impact on me. That I am wiser because of it. Maybe if I read the book enough times I will some day cease to be a turkey... In any case, I bought the second edition, not just for the new section but also to re-read the entire book. Ok, the impact of a second reading is not the same sensation of being struck by a thunderbolt that you felt three years ago. For one thing, Taleb's ideas have gone mainstream. They're simply everywhere. I was recently listening to a lecture from British astronomer Martin Rees and, boom, the Black Swan is there. The concept even pops up in books written before 2000 (read Stephen Jay Gould's Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin for a pre-Talebian critique of the Gaussian curve that sounds distinctly familiar). For another, a megacatastrophe like the 2008 financial meltdown has made us more amenable to the idea that the universe is probably less stable than we delude ourselves into believing, and that ""economy"" and ""equilibrium"" should probably not be used in the same sentence.

So is it worth buying the expanded edition? The author has apparently been told one too many times that there aren't enough positive recommendations in the original book. Busy executives want ""actionable lists."" Editors want tidy tips to put at the back of the book. Although Taleb protests repeatedly that negative advice is just as useful as positive prescriptions, he caves in to a certain extent and --in his trademark obnoxious style-- goes on to lay out several useful dictums to guide you in life, some more tongue-in-cheek than other (""Don't give dynamite sticks to children even if warning labels are attached""). Having drunk the Kool-Aid, I found the section enjoyable (not surprisingly), but probably the most useful tip is that it highlights over and over the importance of the ""barbell strategy"" laid out in Chapter 13: don't be moderately conservative or moderately aggressive; rather, be hyperconservative but leave some exposure to positive Black Swans. In any case, if you want very explicit answers to the burning questions of the moment, you will find some here: further stimulus runs the risk of setting in motion inflationary forces that are scarily non-linear; don't let anything become too big to fail; love redundancy, etc. Hey, there's even a hint at a pre-historic diet and exercise plan. Somebody get this man a Dear Abby column. Better yet: when is the ""Black Swan Cookbook"" coming out? I'm only half joking. I would totally buy it.",2

Stephen Kibsella,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,It's not really a book about statistics...,"Reading a lot of the reviews, it strikes me that some people have missed Taleb's point---the book isn't really about statistics, or economics, or finance at all. It's more of a lifestyle guide---how to live in the presence of unknown unknowns. Simply put, one should be humbler about what can be known---don't fall into the obvious traps of epistemological arrogance about what can be known, or what Taleb calls the `ludic fallacy'---stop trying to fit things into a Gaussian box because things are computationally and philospohically more tractable that way, and go for things that all long odds. Most of the time you'll lose small. But when the big one comes around, you're made for life (or completely undone). One can apply this principle all over the place, the most mundane example being investments, or going on dates, or reading books, etc. Overall I enjoyed TBS, but really enjoyed Fooled by Randomness, which I think is better written. It's just as smart as TBS though. Taleb's Dynamic Hedging, btw, is the best finance book I've ever come across. I teach financial economics straight out of it to undergrads, and they get it. Personally I'd love to take a course from him.

Bookman,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,A book too far,"This is a book of 366 pages which tries to communicate the following thought: The future is unpredictable, and one big reason it's unpredictable is that unexpected events occur which are unforeseeable. These events are called black swans. If a good editor had edited this book, the book could have been cut to 50 pages. An even better editor would have cut the book to 10 pages. This book is essentially a one page magazine article for which Nassim Taleb got a book deal to expand the gist of the article to 366 pages. The writing is unfocused, wandering, disjointed, unconnected, and of a style one might call stream-of-conscious. This reviewer couldn't get through more than half of the book before he felt that reading the last half would be a boring, waste of time.

L. F. Smith,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,I can save you the price of this book...,"I can save you the price of this book-- and the time it would take you to read it-- by summarizing its main point: Hard-to-predict events are hard to predict, and because they're hard to predict, we often fool ourselves into thinking that we can predict them. But we can't.

Seriously, that's pretty much it. I was very disappointed by this book, mostly because the reviews were so good, and the author is both a serious academic and a Wall Street star.

After spending hundreds of pages explaining that we can't predict rare events very well, mostly because they're rare, the author slides into what I assume he believes is proof that essentially, everything that happens comes down to luck. Why did Rome fall? Blind luck. Why did Microsoft defeat Apple in the marketplace? Blind luck. And so on.

Of course, over the years, we've developed explanations for those events and most other things that have happened. The author airily dismisses all such attempts to explain historical events after the fact as ""narrative fallacies."" Well, no, not always; sometimes those explanations are actually explanations of what clearly happened.

The author even offers what he claims is the sole practical way to deal with the Black Swans we encounter in the operations of the financial sector: We should invest at least 85% of our assets in risk-free T-bills and the remainder in very high-risk investments, such as junk bonds. This idea is an old one, and computer simulations consistently show that it will return less than the 60% stocks and 40% bonds allocation that most financial planners have advocated for many years.

Finally, I didn't care for the tone of the book. It comes off as smug and almost cutsie at times. This is a serious subject, and it deserves a serious treatment. Of course, this is my personal, subjective reaction; others may not be as bothered by the tone as I was.

In summary, I found this book to be uneven and disappointing. Why not one star? Because the chapters that deal with how we let the bell curve seduce us into erroneous thinking are actually quite good. If only the rest of the book had been so good...",13

Peter Barnett,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,What is a Black Swan Really,"There is a curious mention in the ""How to Look for Bird Poop"" chapter about the melt down of the Russian financial system in 1998. While this event may have been a Black Swan to the author's employer at the time, it certainly was predicted more than a decade earlier. I attended a Rotary Club meeting in the mid-80s at which the speaker outlined all of the conditions that existed at the time that would lead to the failure of the Russian financial system.

In many ways, the speaker's reasoning was little different from predicting a personal bankruptcy. Cash going out cannot exceed cash coming in over the long term. If it does, bad things happen. Given that the Russia of the time was a cash and carry society it could not sustain its spending habits. Not a very elegant analysis, but still prescient.

So here is the question: If others know about it but you do not is it really a Black Swan event?

In the case of the author's employer, several bankers lost their jobs and, presumably, the bank lost money. In the financial market, being the last to know may be costly but is it really a Black Swan if you are ignorant and your neighbor is not?",4

If you're alive and paying attention, you need to understand the general ideas in Taleb's books. Essentially, the universe is designed such that everything that can happen will happen, and we cannot predict when or what. The financial markets are a mini universe, where lots of things happen repetitively, but not identically, and each event affects subsequent events in ways that are neither obvious nor intuitive.

T. Graczewski,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Disappointing,"In the main, I found “Black Swan” to be terribly disappointing: long-winded, poorly structured, unnecessarily acerbic, often embarrassingly childish, but above all of limited practical application. Author Nassim Taleb launches a frontal assault on social scientists of all stripes, but unleashes particular venom at economists, especially Nobel Prize winners who’s work is based on Gaussian standard distribution. As Gregg Easterbrook commented in a review of “Black Swan” in the New York Times, “Criticizing the accomplished is healthy; mocking them because they are accomplished is sophomoric.” I agree. One gets the sense that Taleb (or his editors) wanted to “punch this book up” in an effort to appeal to a wider, mainstream audience, the types of folks who scoop up “Freakenomics” at airport bookshops. If so, they overshot their goal by a country mile.

For all that I didn’t like about “Black Swan,” Taleb makes several critical points that are worth considering with care. Most of all, I found his warnings about the “narrative fallacy” to be most convincing. “We harbor a crippling dislike for the abstract,” he writes. We seek to fit life and observed experiences into crisp shapes, what he calls “platonicity,” in order to make better sense of the world. “We like stories,” he says, “we like to summarize, and we like to simplify.” The danger is when we confuse these tight and digestible stories with “the truth.”

My work experience at Intuit has confirmed this observation (note: Taleb warns, among many other things, of a “confirmation bias” where we readily accept arguments that confirm what we already believe). Intuit is always on the look out of for the secrets to deliver breakthrough product innovations and readily embraces new procedures and practices developed by other firms, such as Amazon’s “two pizza rule” (product teams need to be small enough to be fed by two pizzas) or “The Lean Startup” focus on leaps of faith hypothesis coupled with rapid prototyping and experimentation. These devices are almost all well-and-good, but they don’t explain why one product succeeds and another fails, at least I don’t think so. Reality is much messier than that. The difference between success and failure is more likely the collection of thousands, perhaps millions, of smaller decisions and actions that “escape the eye of history” as it were. There is no better – and certainly no more dramatic – articulation of this perspective than coach Tony D’Amato’s (played by Al Pacino) locker room pregame pep talk in the movie “Any Given Sunday”: “…the inches we need are everywhere around us!” Indeed, they are.

A foundational element of Taleb’s worldview is that we live, mainly, in a so-called Extremistan, where the “highly unlikely” occurs more often then we presume and which renders all other observations, certainly those based on a bell shaped distribution, completely invalid. Consider the modeling of height and wealth. In the first case, you take 999 randomly selected humans on planet earth and put them in an auditorium. The average (median) height is perhaps 5’7”. Next, for the 1,000th participant you include the tallest man on earth, a solid eight-footer. The median height of those 1,000 humans barely moves with this most extreme addition. Now consider wealth. The 999 randomly selected humans may have an average wealth of $50,000. And then you add Bill Gates for participant 1,000 and suddenly the “average” wealth per human shoots from $50K to $250M (or whatever it would be). Human height is from Mediocristan; wealth is from Extremistan. Taleb’s core argument is that we live in Extremistan, yet our statisticians and economists and elected leaders continue to behave as though we live in a completely different world, Mediocristan. Mediocristan is the world of platonicity (a frustrating part of this book is keeping straight all the corny names Taleb has made up, although he does include a helpful glossary in the back). “Platonic is top-down, formulaic, close-minded, self-serving and commoditized,” which is perfect for exploring Mediocristan. “A-platonic is bottom-up, open-minded, skeptical, and empirical,” and that’s what the author claims is necessary to navigate through Extremistan.

To make things worse, those platonic intellectuals investigating uncertainly have traditionally focused on games of chance, the most ill-suited analogy possible, according to Taleb. These games of chance – cards, slots, dice – are actually some of the most predictable things in life, he says. Where else can you get such mathematically clear outcomes for success and failure over multiple attempts? Far from being risky, they are more like testing average heights among humans. The tendency to promote classic gambling uncertainty to the “real world” is something that Taleb dubs the “Ludic fallacy,” another one of his corny creations.

In the end, what frustrated me most about “Black Swan” was what to do with his insights, most of which have real merit. Taleb implores us not to trust so-called experts, especially when they are making predictions about the future. These men and women of supposed great learning are “mere entertainers,” he sneers. They are like people “driving a school bus blindfolded” – incredibly dangerous and irresponsible. So what should responsible members of society do? What are the “lessons of the Black Swan”? Well, there really aren’t any, at least not so far as I could tell. Over nearly 400 pages of dense text, Taleb only shreds and tears down. The closest he comes to providing constructive, actionable feedback is this: “favor experimentation over storytelling, experience over history, and clinical knowledge over theories.” Fair enough, I suppose; but hardly much.",3
Center Path,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,I feel the author has already made his point in ...,I feel the author has already made his point in the first few chapters and the rest of the book is rehashing the same ideas with different examples which don't really add anything.,2
Kenneth P. Bloch,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Black Swan Awareness: Look for the Positive and Protect Yourself from the Negative!,"I'm giving this book five stars to apply what I learned about the dangers of staying in the middle. I think this book was written with the financial investment community in mind - and I learned some important lessons about mitigating investment risks - but that's not why I started reading it. I started reading it because I fully connected with the prologue - especially with NNT's commentary about how those who successfully avoid ""Black Swans"" are never rewarded for their success. We tend to glorify those who come to the rescue only after something catastrophic occurs, whereas there is no way to reward the real heroes - those who avoid the catastrophe, because we have no way to identify who they are. In fact, we tend to scorn them for making us do uncomfortable things that save lives by avoiding Black Swans. NNT's compelling argument made about a gutsy politician who may have taken a pro-active stand against the 9/11 attacks is what hooked me (on page xix). But unfortunately there was no further discussion on this, which I believe would be an interesting topic for any engineer, sociologist, or philosopher to continue with.

Other than that one disappointment, I am happy to have finished the book. I now see the bell curve and standard deviations differently and something potentially dangerous, whereas before I had not given it any thought. The parts written about good, desirable Black Swans are right-on and a fine argument against complacency. It puts you in control of your destiny rather than being made the victim while watching others around you steal the glory. NNT hits a home run in the final chapter by wrapping-up some of the details I had problems with earlier, which for me made the tough read worth while. Yes, we are all Black Swans.",2
Robert A. Likis,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,The Black Swan,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan must not be read unless you're prepared to open your mind for interaction. I have always read everything automotive that I could get my hands on... great for hosting car talk shows, but very tunneling.
NNT's book was my first book purchase outside my comfort zone / wish I remembered how it came my way. Regardless, I found the book difficult to read (for me) requiring full and complete dedication to each page. Most books are made up of sentences that form paragraphs, but The Black Swan is comprised of story-telling-sentences within paragraphs.
I have already started my second reading in hopes to better grasp NNT's full meaning. I highly recommended this book for those who think they already know what they know.",2
Stephen Hage,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Never Trust An Expert,"Book Review submitted by: Stephen J. Hage, SteveH9697@aol.com

In this book Taleb uses the term black swan as a metaphor for the unexpected. He chose it because, before Australia was discovered, people in the Old World were convinced that all swans were white.

The bombing of the Twin Towers in New York on 9/11 is a perfect example of what Taleb means by the term black swan. Other examples are best selling books by unknown authors and insanely popular new restaurants. He also points out that another type of Black Swan is the highly expected event not happening.

The defining characteristics of black swans are puzzling; a combination of low predictability and large impact.

Taleb's central theme is since Black Swans are unpredictable we need to adjust to their existence and that trying to predict them is futile. The best way to do that is by focusing on antiknowledge, or what we don't know. This advice provides the grist for his engaging, thoughtful and thoroughly provocative expository mill.

Taleb is an iconoclastic polymath who lays bare the futility in our belief that we actually can predict the future with any degree of success. And he shows this to be true by demonstrating the abysmal track records of those high priests we rely on like stock market analysts of every ilk including the mathematical economists or ""Quants.""

The true and lasting value of this book is Taleb's ability to write by telling stories that deal with subjects that are complex, abstruse and difficult to understand. But, not to worry; the stories are easy to read, fun and highly thought provoking.

The subject matter deals with almost any situation imaginable and identifies techniques we can all use to protect against being hoodwinked by ""experts"" willing to advise us on how best to handle complex situations and how to position ourselves to collect serendipitous Black Swans of the positive variety.

I strongly recommend you read this book. And, if you do, I promise you won't be disappointed.",7

Eric Furst,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Points for his points,"NNT would scold me for reading a handful of reviews before writing mine; I'm no better than those who panned his fictitious Russian author.

It's a book worth reading, though if you're among the legions of business folk who make their living deceiving themselves with their prognostication abilities, I might take pause. Me, I'm an engineer, one who got a masters in statistics but never got to hear Taleb's ideas in a classroom. Maybe I wouldn't have been so sick of the subject by the end of the degree if I had.

I'd recommend it to anyone who thinks they have a grasp on the future but be sure to give the author a break - for an enlightened erudite to be anything but insufferable would be a black swan indeed.",2
Glenn D. Robinson,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,one of those that everyone should read,"Deep thoughts. All too often in the organizations I have been with, we have quickly believed our own assumptions and beliefs. This book points out the fallacy of doing so with some coined terms.

Camber,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,A Major Achievement -- Don't Miss It!,"Most of the criticisms of Taleb and this book seem reasonable:

- His confidence sometimes seems to reach the level of condescending arrogance.

- With a wave of the hand, he dismisses those he disagrees with, even Nobel prize winners. And perhaps he oversimplifies their positions in order to argue with their straw-man shadows.

- He often circles around his points without winding up finally making his points clear. Is this how a supposedly street-smart guy should talk?

- His frequent digressions make it hard for the reader to follow the thread of his narrative, sometimes giving the impression that there actually is no such thread, and that we're just witnessing his stream of consciousness.

- One could argue that the more technical chapters are written poorly and are therefore too unclear.

- Many of his ideas aren't as original as he seems to imply, so maybe he needs to explicitly give more credit to others.

- His suggestions on investing aren't very specific, and one wonders if they rely too much on luck or being rich in the first place.

- His references to his anger suggest a need for personal growth.

But this book easily deserves 5 stars and its bestseller status. Why?

- Taleb's erudition is undeniable, and a strong case can be made for his iconoclastic brilliance as well. In a book like this, perhaps the usual modesty and humility wouldn't make sense?

- His criticism of his opponents may have more validity than we normally want to admit in polite society. It's scary to think that economists and others in finance are generally as clueless as Taleb suggests, but recent events seem to have significantly (and unfortunately) vindicated him.

- His refusal to get right to the point pushes you to think more deeply about the implications of his ideas, rather than just quickly saying ""yes, that's obvious, so what?"" It's not enough to merely understand something; it has to sink in, in a way that genuinely changes your worldview and approach.

- Once you drop your preconceptions of how a book should be written, most of his digressions are fun and many are quite insightful. For an open-minded person with an intellectual inclination, this can be a tremendously entertaining book (it certainly was for me). Taleb deploys his own intellect and erudition for us with an unusual frankness which is worthy of our appreciation; instead of being put off by it, enjoy the ride!

- I do think the technical chapters are lacking but, alas, it's hard to write a perfect book, especially for an audience with varying technical background. I think we can cut him some slack here.

- His ideas may not be entirely original, but the way he's woven them together and presented them with flourish certainly is. Ideas need to be communicated to have any value, and Taleb can surely deliver his ideas in a way that has lasting impact on the reader.

- This book is about black swans in general, not investing in particular, so let's not get carried away if the book doesn't provide a how-to guide on getting or staying rich. And Taleb's general advice to arrange safeguards against financial disaster, and also get exposure to potentially huge opportunities, certainly seems sensible.

- His anger surprises and even disappoints at first, but one eventually starts to wonder if it might not be at least partly justified. Things might be worse than we want to believe. After all, isn't that part of his thesis? Plus he does end on a very positive note.

The bottom line is that this book is truly unique in its ability to intellectually entertain while conveying some deep insight and wisdom. Few people in the world have the right intersection of ingredients to produce a book like this, so we should cherish the fact that the book exists. Even if you don't fully agree with him, Taleb is worth engaging with.

I've read this book in print and also listened to the excellent unabridged audiobook, and I look forward to returning to it at least a few more times in the future. This book changed my outlook in some fundamental ways, and I think that's about as much as we can hope for with any book.

Very highly recommended. Indeed, don't miss it!

Also, for readers who like this book and also have a strong interest in science, I suggest considering Chance and Chaos by David Ruelle.",3

What diminished book and author greatly for me, are the constant references about how much smarter he is than nobel-prize winners, academic and medical establishment and so on. I am not one to mind some good jabs, but it was the repetitiveness of it that turned me off to Taleb as a person. He complains a lot about 'dull' intellectual, but his constant vitriol got dull also. He judges several people, as persons he would not like to meet in real life, I feel the same way about him. All in all it is a good book, that synthesizes important ideas and is worth reading.. A much better book, that covers much of the same ground, is Daniel Kahnemans 'Thinking Slow and Fast'. Kahnemann manages to bring across many of the the same but stays a gentleman",3
Ron Tarro,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Connecting fundamental truths to today's hard realities ...,"Enlightening book. Nassim Taleb has questioned at length the (empirical and philosophical) foundations of our public thinking. He operates from high ground as he foretold our current global economic story. To illustrate: Imagine an aspiring politician who predicts that her policies will create one million jobs, or the incumbent politician who reads his tea leaves and announces that his policies have created two million new jobs. You, like me, have probably wondered: ""In such a big and complicated world, how do they know the impact of their actions, and more generally the future, with such singular clarity and absolute certainty?"" Taleb describes in detail why their (and our) confidence is not justified and he points us beyond the chatter of our society's big talkers"" and toward the minds of Benoit Mandelbrot, Karl Raimond Popper, and Fredrieck Hayak'(while are providing reasons to be skeptical of Carl Freidrick Gauss and the bell curve). Taleb connects their ideas to the hard realities we face today. This book is ultimately an essay about mathematical empiricism, philosophy, reason, risk, uncertainty, and real life. But what makes it a great read is that Taleb actually takes the time to ""dis"" entire professions (if not individual professionals and public figures) on the solid grounds of intellectual merit. There's not enough of that in this world. His willingess to do it makes the book even more interesting and harder to ignore.",3

They stick with me pretty well, so I get bored on second readings. However, The Black Swan was both so important and so dense with information that I plan on giving it another read through before too long. Taleb's main premise is Socratic in nature: we are overconfident in what we know. We base our predictions of the future on the past which is horribly irrelevant in the case of events that have never happened before. He rails against academics in quite a pompous way that would have turned me off if he didn't seem to be so damn correct. The titular Black Swan is an event which is an outlier with extreme impact that we humans tend to give explanation to post facto as if it were predictable beforehand. He spends a lot of time defining the difference between ""Mediocristan"" variables - things that can be modeled by bell curves and standard operating procedure and ""Extremistan"" variables that are Mandlebrotian and in the realm of the Black Swan. I could try to further summarize here, but the book is too full of interesting arguments and too layered in its approach for me to do justice to it. Instead, I encourage you to pick it up.

Craig L. Howe,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Randomness Reduced to Words,"As much as I enjoyed this book, I could have stopped after digesting the summary contained on the inside leaf of its jacket.

Don't take my lead the wrong way. I ordered The Black Swan the evening I received an e-mail announcement of its soon-to-be publication. It may have taken me a little longer to read it than my fellow reviewers, but I was not going to miss it.

Taleb's first book, Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets articulated fleeting thoughts harbored by me for years.

1. Random events are unpredictable.
2. They arrive with a massive impact.
3. Immediately afterwards a rational explanation can be concocted.

Who could have active in the markets as long as I without experiencing an evening trip home perusing real estate ads for a castle in the South of France only to wake the next morning and experience a meat cleaver appearing from the middle of nowhere and removing half of your face.

My mistake, I now recognize, was in expecting Euclidean precision in a book about randomness. It will never happen. Sure, I scrutinized the end notes, pondered the bibliography selectively adding books and journal articles for my Umberto Eco Memorial Library.

I loved the book. I am sure Taleb benefited greatly from articulating and expressing the thoughts contained in it. If you seek a narrative on randomness, save your time and money. Like his previous book, reading this will change the way you perceive events. You will find yourself with a new appreciation for life's outliers.",5
P. Nash,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Shocked to discover there really *was* an editor, it doesn't show","For being yet another Big Idea book, this book is so horribly organized and the idea so incompletely explained that it utterly fails to impart much besides a few simplistic mental models that would have taken about two pages to summarize.

The best part of this book is the concept of the title, which is unfortunately something that he never completely fleshes out in a way that you can usefully apply. Instead, ""NNT"" spends a ton of time talking about the history of many ""slighted"" historical thinkers, a club he proudly includes himself in. In order to elevate the status of these maligned heroes, he spends great effort tearing down most commonly recognized philosophers, economists, writers, etc.

There were the kernels of some interesting ideas in here, which never got polished. The editor utterly failed to help focus the text and explain things in a coherent way. As an example, there are long diatribes about the plight of his ancestral home, many jokes about the French, spiteful slurs against Nobel laureates, especially in economics, and a very ironic soapbox speech about the uselessness of editors that ""distill one's message until it has lost all value and consistency."" Funny, that. We get that you think the Bell Curve is a Great Intellectual Fraud. Fine, fine, but get to the point already and stop ranting like a blogger.

I agree with other reviewers also about the narcissism and delusions of intellectual grandeur. But my main complaint is that the practicality of the distinction between white, black, and gray swans was never really painted clearly. For example, it would have been really interesting to know the details of how he applied the Big Idea to the real-world financial trading he supposedly is really successful at. He doesn't seem interested to divulge the details. If a magician won't reveal his tricks and this book is an essay about NNT's ""magic trick"" that he doesn't tell you the secret of using, then why buy this book?

This is my first encounter with Taleb's work, and I have to say that I'm pretty unlikely to read any of his other stuff, it being so negatively colored by this waste of time.

By the way, it's not as long as it seems -- the back 20% or so is all references and bibliography. The best feature of this book perhaps, not because I used it, but because it was a welcome end when I thought there was still 100 pages of rant left to endure.",17

However, there is also a lot of garbage to wade through in the form of random, self-indulgent anecdotes and Taleb's sometimes intolerable arrogance. Much of the book introduces ideas I already knew of and had come to on my own, and I suspect this is true for many. As one example, I already know that realized events in the world are not necessarily explained by normal distributions -- that is easy to see for anyone who understands normal distributions and thinks about the world for a few minutes. He also gives a summary of the work of Daniel Kahneman; I'd personally just rather read ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" for that.

Alfred E. Green,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Help for the masses,"What the author has exposed in this book should have been obvious. But it's because we as a modern people are highly programed to think and respond as a herd( for lack of a better word)is the reason we don't readily see all the possibilities.At times he(the author) tend to come off as being sarcastic as if he's toying with with our(collectively speaking)simple mindedness.Overall,if you are honest with yourself this book can be enlightning and even provocative. Excellent peice of work!",2
GLK,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Not for Cab Drivers,"Most of the people that buy this book do so to seek information to gain a larger perspective (advantage)? in life. However, most (myself included) are ""cab drivers"" not CEOs. When Puckish guys like Taleb who are obviously well read are allowed the luxury of a platform on which to ramble they make what seems a no-lose case for their cause. But they're not talking to us cab drivers, they're speaking to CEOs. To what end other than a potential trickle-down effect do regular folk hope to gain by examining his pearls before the swine? Not much, I'm afraid. His Optima fund is nothing more than a contrarian insurance policy the moneyed few can utilize in case of disaster in the market. I'm not saying that's a bad thing but it is hardly original. I am but the lowliest of the lowly and I've been saying for the better part of a year that hyperinflation may be around the corner. Am I some kind of genius? Hardly. In fact, even if many of the average Joes in this country know that their entire way of life hangs in the equilibrial balance of decisions made by self-serving morons they simply do not have the resources to do anything about it. In essence most of the people that buy and read his books are screwed either way. Then there are pearls such as the case he makes regarding the common intelligence test question (I'm paraphrasing because I don't feel like looking it up): ""If all Zagrots are Zimbles then are all Zimbles Zagrots?"" Then he delicately makes it analogous to a racial situation by implying that even though all of Race A may be Criminals, all Criminals are not necessarily comprised of Race A, then cheekily concludes that even those who know better will cringe when on alone on an elevator with a member of Race A. Hmmm? It seems to me that if I am to avoid a potential Black Swan event it would behoove me to avoid the elevator, right? And that's where all his books fall flat. They spend a lot of time criticizing our human foibles but very little time explaining what to do about them. Perhaps I could make a case for reading his books if I felt that, in some way, they illuminated my mind in such a way that they enabled me to avoid the pitfalls in thinking that seem to plague us all. He credits some of his own ability for abstract thinking from reading tons of books and becoming an aesthete. A rather impractical solution for us Cab Drivers. So all a guy like myself can derive from his books is a lengthy endorsement for his Optima fund. Except it doesn't matter because in perfect Talebian style the fund is closed to outside investors. It figures.",3
Ilya Grigorik,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Land of Extremistan,"Another thought provoking read by Nassim Taleb; some of the arguments are reminiscent of his earlier book ('Fooled by Randomness'), but the asymmetries of our daily life are explored in much more detail. 'The Black Swan' alludes to the 'fractal', or highly variable, non-Gaussian flow of history and events - as Nassim states, our history is a series of jumps, not sigma-based variations. This same concept applies to the markets, social sciences, and many other 'assumed to be Gaussian' processes in our daily life.

Tirades against narrative fallacy, or our tendency to fit patterns and do 'dimensionality reduction', and retrospective distortion, our illusion of posterior predictability due to selective recall and fact-fitting are sprinkled throughout the text. The arguments are interesting, but need be taken with a grain of salt - I think that's the way the author would want them to stand. In the end, you won't be able to predict the future, but perhaps you'll become a fool that is aware of some of his own follies - the information about the possibility of a Black Swan is valuable by itself.",2

Additionally, many sections seemed to get derailed from the chapter they were in, and all the name dropping became pretentious to say the least.

K. Swamy,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Fascinating, but extreme at times ...","I really enjoyed reading Taleb's Black Swan. Much more than I enjoyed Fooled by Randomness. The key takeaway is that extreme events are not to be mathematically predicted because:
a. they are not as infrequent as statistical distributions expect them to be
b. they often tend to have extreme impacts on the worlds we live and work in

While the broad sentiment professed by Taleb, that everything in life does not follow a bell-curve, makes sense - I am less impressed by Taleb's diatribe against using any form of statistical distributions in general. I guess Taleb found it necessary to take an extreme position for his own very good reasons, but I would have taken a slightly more balanced view, all said and done.

Another valuable insight that is worthwhile for all of us readers to remember (it's nothing new) is the opportunity knocks only once. And therefore, take full advantage of any opportunity presented. This message gets lost in the overall theme and tone of the book, but is the most valuable takeaway for me.",1
TJ Cartwright,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,book,"good book, not for the uneducated and then for the educated with an open mind and some science or business backround",2
Gozzi,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Wrong Species, Chicken Little not Swan","As with many post-modern works this volume promises far more than it delivers; a glimpse of wisdom but never anything we can really use. The Black Swan is merely the unanticipated event that screws things up royally. Taleb, Professor of the Sciences of Uncertainty, is copious with references but thin in his digesting or explanation of many. I cannot exchange one-on-one with Taleb on the tails of the financial market changes he's most concerned with but I have read his book and must admit the second half was so aggravating I was dreaming of this review.

He is correct suggesting that the media is irritatingly compelled to give, often silly, ""explanations"" for every Dow fluctuation. The evening news is not science. I'm convinced that daily market fluctuations are more due to people, like Taleb, traders, playing with models or guesses trying to hit it big with other peoples' money than media reasons. Randomness and distributions are involved with more than the stock market, statistics and philosophies. My problem with this book is that Taleb throws out everything and replaces it with nothing. The title invokes the wrong species; it seems clear that Chicken Little and the Impact of the Highly Improbably is a much more appropriate title.

Anyone who has tracked data (any kind, your weight, S&P500, maximum temperature, rainfall, or gasoline prices) over any amount of time knows that the progression is seldom smooth. This is particularly true when tracing the values of individual firms; which is one of the devises used by Taleb to make his points. If a particular investment firm goes belly up because they adopted an extreme strategy, honest or not, why throw out all strategies? If you want very much higher than average returns on your investments, then you must incur higher than average risks; meaning, without statistics, that your down side can be significant. But, if you're targeting average or slightly above average returns, there are strategies Prof Taleb doesn't explain except to reject in blanket fashion. Perhaps it's a statistical unworthy ancestor but why is there no mention of the central limit theorem? Gaussian, certainly but evidenced as well. Yes averaging minimizes the extreme; dismissed as ""grey swan."" He purposely avoids even basic technical definitions, relying on flip condemnation. But, I care less about the rarified investment world that Taleb seems obsessed with, or his lack fit with the philosophers. I find the most egregious prose in this book is leveled against ""social sciences"" although Taleb exhibits virtually no knowledge of the subject, not its depth or especially its range.

Consider the question of forecasting the traffic levels on a road system in Taleb's home area. This is an area of statistical forecasting shared by civil engineers, planner, geographers, and yes, economists. Taleb will prefer to drive his BMW (why am I certain he drives a BMW?) on roads whose planners have anticipated the traffic levels with a high degree of accuracy for those average days he drives to his editor to discuss profits of his newest book. The planners, indeed Taleb, will be most interested in the normal day not the one day when 12 inches of snow falls or when the unexpected meteor crashes at the end of his driveway. He will listen to the news and realize 12 inches of snow is coming, perhaps he should not venture out, or he'll creep along cursing the weather station. Or, in the second case, he could be squashed by the meteor. We live, everyday, with average and normal conditions and behavior; many of us, social scientists, meteorologists, planners, just regular people try to cope with the normal operations of society, not the unanticipated extremes of the distribution. We plan for tomorrow not someday when the ""sky may fall."" Yes, some days we get it wrong but most we get it right or at least come close. Being ready for the extremes is meaningful, and the notion I thought this book was going to be about, but the normal tomorrow is what I train people to deal with.

I recognize that there are extreme, powerful, random events; Taleb, rightfully, keeps coming back to war; he perhaps was closer to it than many. But, if by definition I can't predict the events or change them, what should I do? Taleb, having said I should reject virtually all ""science"" that helps me predict the normal, the average, and at least some of the fluctuation, advises me to be ""noncommoditized in [my] thinking"" and to not be a sucker. More than ""postmodern"" Taleb is also elitist in that he draws our attention to the positive Black Swans in that we ""want"" to have the benefits of picking the great new stock before it's great. He want us to recognize that the positive Black Swans are ""random"" and focus less on the negative Black Swans of normal process. The idea of civilization is based on a society protecting itself from the random insults of the real world. Taleb maligns social science but ignores the underlying forces of civilization - to provide protection from extreme hurt to those who don't deserve it. Indeed, the whole notion of a progressive income tax is societies way of dealing with the everyday black swans, so are dams, guardrails, and a host of normal projections of the possible. Taleb seems more concerned for the losses/gains of the super-rich.

Prof Taleb, you have told your reader to throw out most statistical theory. How have fractiles helped you cope with war? Or, better to end it? The posture of this book I contend, is ""post modern"" and irresponsible. I'm tempted to look at your Fooled by Randomness because I suspect you may have stretched what was left of your idea to write this one, The Black Swan, is too thin of content but way too dense of attitude. Like I said ""Chicken Little"" not swan-like at all.",18

It is a tour de force of philosophy, mathematics, psychology, finance, statistics and NNT, himself. First, I absolutely love how Taleb thinks out loud. I feel like I know him now--especially after reading the book twice--the second time very, very slowly with pencil in hand. He is a very, very deep thinker and the fact that he chooses to let us be a part of his thoughts is a real gift--as he does not need to publish books.

Taleb's scope is both broad and detailed and he brings to life the great thinkers of past centuries. Poincare, Mandelbrot, Plato, Sextus Empiricus, Algazel... The Black Swan is a history of philosophy to the nth degree--centered around unpredictibility and the unknown. Taleb has an amazing brain, and amazing emotions that shows a passion for his topic unsurpassed by others. From a coctail party in Europe with intellectuals to fractals and statistics... His conclusions make total sense. I really like this gentleman.

One can't solve a problen unless you percieve the problem correctly. Taleb's numerous chapters on how we, how our brains and egos are programmed to misperception and are utterly invaluable. I feel I can much better assign -- or especially not assign causality to events. Another life lesson that I think about almost every day, never run for a train. And needless to say, I was compelled to tossed out all of my economics--which felt so good to do.

For all those reviewers who gave this book a negative review, I can only conclude that they read this book very fast and that they were looking to find a get rich quick solution -- which this book is not about.

And for those who have not read this because they think it's just another popular culture book on decision science--you could not be more wrong.

This book was a profound, unique experience, from the first word to the very last word. When I finished, I just wanted to start reading it over again.

It was a Black Swan that told me about this book. I will never be the same.

Nassim has some interesting examples of anomalies in rational behavior, however nothing unfamiliar for people in the quantitative finance community.

Professor Bubba,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,A fun book,"There is a lot of great stuff in this book, and it's fun to read. I particularly enjoyed the discussion of Mandelbrot and fractals, without being able to explain why. It is rare that someone would tackle a topic like this, and it is clear that the rarity of discussion is related to the fact that this idea is not a very attractive meme.

But besides that, here is the problem with the book. It is long on problem and short (or vague) on solution. I think that the anecdotal exposition of the problem wasted too much ink, because it is pretty intuitive to understand. (I skipped pages 160 to 200 without missing anything).

Now when you get to the solution (or at least, the alternative approach), you get a fascinating description of fractals, but unfortunately, I don't think the book actually ties this approach in with the problem. I can't see how anyone is going start a hedge fund based on Mandelbrot, but maybe that's the point.

His real life approaches are actually more effective, but he brings them in too briefly. Basically, he prescribes living with a lot of little failures in order to maximize the chance of a big win, while protecting against the big failures (in investing, for example). We need more exposition on that.

His argument is basically that life is the only real game of chance, and it is probably impossible to compute or predict. And I think he needs to spend more time saying, ""But cheer up; it's not so bad (and this is why).""",10

I was very disappointed in the book....probably one of the more poorly crafted books I have read in a long while. He claims in the introduction that the effort to write his book was effortless and that 'the book just wrote itself'.........and it shows. It was a chaotic read and at first I thought that that was his PLAN to keep us in chaos given the theme of his book and that somehow then it would resolve itself in a fun ending of some kind. Didn't happen. The author could have made his point well in about 20 pages (and don't get me wrong, there were EXCELLENT points in this book) but instead it just droned on . Frustrating as well would be he would introduce a subheading within a chapter as if he was going to address that topic, and then never did. If you want a much more enjoyable way to cover this same kind of material....and done so much more informatively.....I'd recommend the 1978 BBC video series of James Burke ""Connections"". It's amazing how much Burke covered in 1978 that still is relevant today and stated far much better than Taleb.",9
therosen,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Powerful insights - well done!,"This is a very important book for decision makers - it helps explain fallacies of common thought, and suggests ways to avoid these problems. It's written in a style that highlights the achievements of doers over false philosophers and thinkers who encourage this mistaken style of thinking. Fooled by Randomness teaches us the importants of understanding the impact of random events. The Black Swan teaches us not to be fooled by attempts to measure them.

2 big core concepts drive the book:
- Where models (mental or computer based) are used, people too often resort to using ""Bell Curve"" based models, which dramatically underestimate the occurance of extreme events.
- Even if the right model is used, many events simply aren't able to be modelled. The biggest extreme events aren't contained in the model's parameters or output.

There are several complaints levelled against the book:
- Practioners at least know about #1 - and in the financial markets they don't trust the bell curve. The author would likely admit to this, and takes more issue with academics wedded to the bell curve.
- The author is too pompous and arrogant - It is hard to make a book about mathematical modelling interesting. I suspect with a flatter tone, none of us would have even heard of the book.
- It's too long. All in, it's much more than just a 1 idea concept book like ""The Long Tail"" or ""Blink"" - it explores the ideas further, and demonstrates them across many fields.

The book is easy reading, but not to be taken all in one sitting. Mulling over a chapter or so a day will leave the reader understanding some powerful concepts.",7

H. Schneider,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Better broadly right than precisely wrong,"A mostly entertaining and sometimes irritating book full of wisdom and vanity, about the toxicity of facts, the impossibility of meaningful predictions, and life in the opposing worlds of Mediocristan and Extremistan.

Our brains are unable to accept unpredictability. We make up explanations for past events, in the false hope that we can then understand the future, though important things happen mostly outside the narrow corridor of normality. Like the turkey, who has been fed for so many days and projects a positive trend on a linear straight line. Thanksgiving is the turkey's Black Swan.

Taleb is a proper Popperian, which is certainly a good thing in my book. He is also to be praised for his aversion to Platonification. He admires Mandelbrot, which means less to me, but that is surely my fault. And he says he owes more to Kahneman than to anybody else in the world. I believe that and consider it a recommendation.
I do dislike his snotty comments on the Enlightenment and on operas, though. On the other hand, he has the originality to praise both Keynes and Hayek as true thinkers, while the likes of Samuelson turned economics into fraud with their pseudo mathematics and rational man models. I am particularly pleased with Taleb for this rant, since that was exactly my opinion when I was a student of economics. Looong ago.

The author recommends not to read newspapers and not to watch TV for information and interpretation. (I hope he doesn't oppose football news and the Sopranos.) Those details and facts cloud our understanding, and everyone else knows them anyway. He suggests to go to parties and pick up chance information from small talk.

For all his insights, the author is able and likely to make silly judgmental statements.
What about this one: he mocks people who use an elevator to go to the gym, where they use the stair master. Mr. Taleb, have you no practical sense? Don't you sweat if or when you work out?
Another one: he claims that loss of manufacturing jobs can go along with a general rise of living standards. Possibly so, but we are not told where that is happening. Certainly not in the US.
This book will not bore you, but it may annoy you a few times. I revisit it for the second edition and like it much better this time than last time. The new edition adds a lengthy essay and more footnotes, but keeps the original main text body intact.",4

David,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,A poor book from a pompous writer,"Mr Taleb is trying to become a self proclaimed philosopher by over writing himself into irrelevant, overdescribed and in many cases contradictory arguments.

I failed to learn anything from his story that Dr Yossi Vardi asked him to recite something on one leg after he had a few great glasses of wine in Munich. I have no idea if Mr Taleb could do it without the wine! I did understand that he is telling us that he is part of a world jet-set of money making people.

He is full of negative criticism about too many issues, in many cases he does not even bother to analyze and convince the reader of his criticism like in the case of Sydney (Australia) Opera. Maybe there were objective reasons for the construction delay? Maybe corruption, an earth quake? Nothing - just point blank ""you are nothing""

Mr. Taleb asks ""stupid questions and gets stupid answers"". He is forcing his listeners in a London seminar to guess how many books are there in Umberto Eco's library. Unless it is a matter of life and death - just go count them...I saw no relevance between irrelevant questions and the appearance of a black swan (unless Mr. Taleb thinks companies are run by guess work).

For me this book only taught me about Mr. Taleb's hidden frustrations and implications on his ego. Mr. Taleb preaches to detach oneself from the environment, news, etc. yet; this environment provides him the audience for him to show how he takes a simple matter and complicates it.

The fact that we have to expect the unexpected, to prepare for the next war, not the last one - is very well known. No one needs to waste valuable time (and money) to pamper Mr. Taleb's ego.

The core ideas of this book could have been summarized in 30 pages.

A great disappointment. My copy is up for sale.",21
Scott Jackson,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"The Black Swan: The Universe is Mandelbrotian, not Gaussian","If you thought that events such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and stock market crashes could be analyzed by traditional Gaussian methodologies, this book will turn you on your ear. The universe, Taleb declares, is Mandelbrotian, not Gaussian, as we will see later.
It is hard to pigeon-hole Taleb. If I said that he is a scholar, a statistician, a philosopher, an essayist, and a Jordanian-born New Yorker, that would come pretty close.
Taleb spends many pages explaining why conventional logic is just wrong. The title of the book is an example. The title comes from the fact that in philosophy there once was an axiom that declared that ""all swans are white."" This statement was meant to be an example of a universal truth, that is, until the discovery of Australia and the black swans that live there. The logic is that truth is not determined by what has been observed; it cannot ignore what has not been observed. Taleb refers to the latter part of this statement as ""silent evidence.""
Taleb discusses both positive Black Swans and negative Black Swans (he always capitalizes Black Swans). Positive Black Swans are opportunities that present themselves unexpectedly, such as investment opportunities. Other examples of positive Black Swans cited by Taleb are the discovery of penicillin and Viagra. Taleb has disdain for financial planners (and a lot of other people) who claim credit for successful financial planning. Planning, he claims, assumes that you know the outcome, which you do not. Financial success, he claims, is just luck or at least just taking advantage of opportunities that unexpectedly arise.
However, he spends most of the book discussing negative Black Swans, such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and stock market crashes, and how they are treated analytically. In risk analysis, these are sometimes referred to as the unknown unknowns. He has disdain once again, for the practitioners of Gaussian probability theory when applied to these types of Black Swans. He also has disdain for Nobel laureates, especially those in economics who apply Gaussian methods. The universe, he declares, is Mandelbrotian, after the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot, who invented the Mandelbrot set and fractals. Mandelbrot asserts, and is supported by Taleb, that natural phenomena behave more like fractals than like Gaussian variables. Fractals increase (or decrease) in size according a scale factor. What does this mean to you and me? It means that ""outlying events"" (as Taleb calls them) occur more frequently and with greater intensity than Gaussian analysis would indicate. Taleb claims that the stock market fall of 1987 would only occur once over a period greater than the age of the universe if we trusted Gaussian analysis.
So how do we handle Black Swans? Taleb does not have a prescriptive nor comprehensive answer to this question except to warn against ignoring them and to strive to mitigate them. The worst thing is to be blind to them, as we are wont to do. For mitigation methods, Taleb mentions both physical and functional redundancy, terms familiar to researchers and practitioners in resilience and resilience architecting. He provides a list of ""ten principles for a Black-Swan-robust society."" One of these is the maxim, ""Compensate complexity with simplicity,"" another way of phrasing the well-known Ockham's Razor, also emphasized in resilience analysis.
Apart from the analytical insights provided in this book, Taleb is also an excellent story-teller. He fills the book with entertaining anecdotes that illustrate his points.
Whether you are looking for an absorbing intellectual read or useful background material for the study of natural and human-made disasters and the resilience of systems to them, The Black Swan is an essential addition to your bookshelf.

Marcy L. Thompson,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Great ideas, irritating book","First of all, I agree with the general point of the book. Taleb is right, no doubt about it. The bell curve is inadequate to describe most real world situations, even (or perhaps especially) those to which it is most commonly applied.

There are plenty of reviews here that will describe everything that is right about the book -- and there is a great deal. However, I lost patience early and had a hard time makingmy way through the book. Here's the primary reason why:

It's not well-written.

Now, at first, I did not notice that, because the writing is fluent and of an appropriate level of complexity to be compatible with the ideas being discussed. The problem is something more structural. I'll give only one example.

The author refers over and over again to ""black swans"" but if you don't read the preface, he never gives a definition of this term. Moreover, even there, he gives only a cursory reference to it. When I read the preface, I figured that the impossibly light treatment of his core metaphor was acceptable because he would undoubtedly define it or explore it in somewhat more depth in the body of the book. No such luck.

If you are a person who skips over prefaces, this book would leae you confused as to what his central metaphor is. Moreover, it's an extremely powerful metaphor. It deserves more than two sentences to describe it.

Near as I can tell, the author's anger got in the way of structuring this book more robustly. He had an enormous amount of important stuff to say, and he couldn't wait to say it, even though the notion of a black swan is both arresting and useful. So he skipped grounding that image in the reader's mind, and made the reader work too hard.

This is one example of ways in which the book's structure interfered in the clean presentation of his very powerful ideas. There's too much repetition, too much anger, too many digressions that look like they should matter but whose relevance is left unclarified.

I still think everyone should read the book. I just wish that was tantamout to a recommendation to work harder than everyone should have to work, just to follow the arguments the author makes.",9
D. J Najarian,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Good read, but fooled by randomness is better","Black swans are rare, unpredicatable events that pack a big punch. As Teleb explains, they are not accounted for by modern financial theories. Black Swans are particularly relevant to today's market calamity...and they will likely arise many times in the remainder of our lifetimes...to our benefit...if we are prepared. The lesson is to prepare for these events...and to exploit them.",1
J. F. Stafura,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Palatable Popper,"I first saw Mr. Taleb at PopTech, a conference of big thinkers that I went to yearly in first half of this decade, the people that spoke there were all smart, leaders in their fields. Taleb's story was different, he was debunking the core beliefs in the area of investment banking.

Simply put, he is the best thinker in the area of Karl Popper's teachings that I've ever met, George Soros is a more well known proponent of Dr. Popper's teaching but I've never been fortunate enough to meet him.

Black Swan will help anyone that has to make critical decisions concerning investments, and if you think the ideas through maybe other areas of life, better and without emotion. Emotion is the fog of the investment world and Taleb is blowing his foghorn for all to hear, if you invest, read this book.",10

David Swan,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Some Heavy Philosophical Thoughts,"My girlfriend was working towards her MBA and received the following assignment. She was too look at the stock performance of a company over a period of time, compare it to news reports and formulate an explanation for the rise and fall of stock prices. In other words she was asked to predict the past. Ah, Economics. `The Black Swan' is about rare and unforeseen occurrences with massive repercussions that prompt `experts' to quickly explain their cause in order to justify their titles as `experts'. We can then all feel secure that our lives aren't controlled by the capricious winds of events beyond our control. The author unleashes an attack on statisticians, economists and others like psychiatrists, college admissions officers, and councilors who claim a high level of knowledge but predict at about the level of a layman. It took about half the book before I felt that I might be starting to understand the authors point and even after putting the book down I'm still not sure I get it.

The number one target of the authors wrath is economists stating that, ""the Nobel medal in economics has not been good for society or knowledge"" calling the prize ""a public relations coup by economists aiming to put their field on higher footing than it deserves"" To that I would say ""AMEN"". Economists have been obsessed with placing economics among the hard sciences. The Chicago school and supply-siders are all convinced that economics can be boiled down to equations on a black board under the assumption that human actors will all operate according to predictable patterns. However the author writes, ""If people make inconsistent choices and decisions, the central core of economic optimization fails. You can no longer produce a ""general theory,"" and without one you cannot predict"". This is the crux of the problem. Many of these Adam Smith, `Invisible Hand' economists have a worldview built on a faulty premise, that human's will always or even generally make reasonable or logical business decisions. The other assumption is that economics are predictable rather than dominated by Black Swan's but as the author writes, ""In the last fifty years, the ten most extreme days in the financial markets represent half the returns"" That's a pretty staggering pronouncement.

Be forewarned that this book gets exceedingly technical in later chapters particularly when the author argues that we live in a world based on Mandelbrot's fractals rather than the Gaussian bell curve. The book is also a rallying cry for skeptics and as someone who picks up every issue of Skeptic magazine I found it quite refreshing. Skepticism is more than disbelief it's about questioning conventional wisdom and carefully deliberating the truth or falsity of a statement or idea. It's a lot easier said than done. I have to say that Mr. Taleb exhibits a bit of a mean streak throughout the book. He does not suffer fools lightly and frequently lists people by name that he disagrees with (and believe me when he disagrees he REALLY disagrees). Most of these people are probably only known in the statistical or economic circles and it seemed a tad excessive to call them out in a best selling book. The author admonishes those who engage in Ad Hominem attacks but some of his definitely skirt the edge. That aside The Black Swan is a book filled with great philosophical musings even if I'm still not sure I totally get it. I give it high marks.",8

A background in statistics, at least at the rudimentary level, is almost a prerequisite. Taleb is a pragmatic, down to earth philosopher and thinker, and each page contains delights and new perspectives. He writes extraordinarily well and the book contains many laugh-out-loud moments (I particularly enjoyed the description of f.y. money as that sum which enables you to say this a few seconds BEFORE hanging up the phone, rather than a few seconds after!). The book covers not only statistics and the stock market, with an emphasis on what is called behavioral finance, but also human nature and perception. Taleb enjoys being a gadfly and on occasion toward the end of the book takes a bit too much delight in his squabbles with others in the field, but overall this is a 10-star book.

Tahl Milburn,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,A Lost Opportunity,"I'll start out with a brief summary. The basic premise of the book is enlightening: the things that most effect your life and history are things that are highly impactful but highly improbable. This is called a ""Black Swan"". The impact of the Web, 9/11, Katrina, the financial crisis, etc. are all events unforeseen, unplanned for, but had an enormous impact.

For most of the book, he resigns himself and all of us to accepting that we can't much plan for the future so don't try. That's the part I'm not too fond of even if he has a point. We can do some scenario planning as a society, as economists, etc. and understand that there are limitations. I think we can also plan for _resilency_ in the case of negative Black Swans, which I think is too often overlooked. In the second edition of the book, he has a postscript essay which, however, does offer some good suggestions.

Lots of good ideas in the book. What makes it an unpleasant read is his ranting. In the process of his exposition, he really disses economists (of which he is one) as being pretty much useless people. There are a lot of people and a lot of professions he believes are useless. Fine. But saying it once is enough.

Taleb's main message: Any model can be wrong, so don't expose yourself to ruin by betting the farm on a model. In other words, don't play Russian Roulette even if your model says you will never lose. (Dah.)

The rest of the book is just more self-evident truths, one man's opinions without supporting facts, common sense, and non-sense (eg., ""A faulty model is worse than no model"". Please, even non-action is based on a model; 'no model' is just not possible.)

Olivier Clementin,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Pretentious ramblings,"I loved Fooled by Randomness. I recommended it to friends, colleagues and candidates. Beside thought-provoking comments on chance and financial markets, Taleb's previous book was a cheerful but cruel variation on the theme of the confusion between success and luck, a subject which has been discussed to death in literature, and which comes down to the question which has probably agitated people ever since ambitious young men walked the streets of Sumer and Akkad, and possibly earlier, being: ""Why Am I Not More Successful ?"".

In Black Swan, Nassim Taleb abandons social critique to focus on philosophy, which unfortunately was the weakest part in Fooled by Randomness. We get several hundred pages of anecdotes and curiosities about Taleb's life, statistics, finance, and more about Taleb, all in a pretentious tone, which I found repetitive and boring (but which some apparently find entertaining). In my view, his main weakness is his poor sense of History - which could come in handy in the study of dynamic phenomena over long periods. While plodding through Taleb's ramblings, I had the impression that what's really missing is having an historical (rather than statistical or mathematical) perspective on events. As for the ""Black Swan"" concept, it is theoretically worthless: since any event can be explained ex-post, a ""Black Swan"" is merely a pretentious term for ""unforeseen event with major consequences"". Incidentally, I find it paradoxical that someone who endeavours to write on uncertainty should be so certain of himself.

And don't try Taleb's approach to risk management, which is essentially forgetting about unfavourable events since they are not predictable. I seem to understand that the author takes a dim view of planning, but he should think again. Planning is what people do when they have to prepare for an uncertain future (like the military does, for example). One of the keys to good planning is general knowledge: reading the newspapers for example, something Taleb takes a misplaced pride in not doing.",78

N. Tuzov,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"A must-read for a quant, but...","... but Dr. Taleb goes too far by claiming that the quantitative analysts, including statisticians, are (or even were) mesmerized by the Gaussian curve or any other quantitative concept, for that matter. Even the undergrads here at Purdue are taught to understand that the mean and standard deviation are not always descriptive of the distribution and that a single outlier can have a great impact on the fit of simple linear regression. As for PhD-level people, there are enough of us able to handle data with care and who are well aware that Pareto & Barabasi is not a cool label of Italian fashion. By the way, how come that Extreme Value Theory (at least 60 years old) is never mentioned in the book dedicated to the extreme?

I don't believe that such people as Markowitz, Scholes, or Samuelson thought even for a second that their job was to create models that would alleviate the hardship of the long-suffering investment banking community. That was never a requirement for academic promotion or the Nobel Prize, which was their ultimate goal, whether they admit it or not. Therefore, any ""quant"" who took those models at face value deserved all he got.

Most importantly, I believe such misguided model-worshippers have always been few in the industry, especially after 1998. MBA graduates, too, have enough sense to know what is what even after being through a Modern Portfolio Theory course. Courses like that, according to Dr. Taleb, have to be wiped out along with the academic disciples of Markowitz and Samuelson. But will that ""ethnical cleansing"" do any good?

Perhaps the sad truth is that in the industry both MBAs and PhDs quickly realized that claiming they can quantify any financial product generates a fat stream of immediate bonuses, although at the expense of possible (but surely very distant :) blowup. If that is the case, all those people consciously use bogus models as a front. Hence, contrary to what Dr. Taleb thinks, Nobel Prize winners and their followers in the academia are hardly to blame. So, why don't we leave the distinguished professors alone and turn to those who set the malign short-term incentives in financial institutions.

David Bridgeland,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,best business book of 2007,"2007 is only 1/3 done, but the year's best business book is already clear. Taleb's book is about black swans---highly improbable events that have a big impact on the world. Think 9/11, the East Asian crash of 1997, or the collapse of the Soviet Empire. Taleb's claim is that there are so many potential black swans that even though each one is very improbable, one or another hits on a regular basis. We are blind to the black swans ahead of time because each is unlikely. More importantly we are blind after the fact because we learn about the details of the black swan that actually hit rather than thinking about all the thousands that could have hit and did not.

Taleb is a scholar and an iconoclast, skewering many sacred cows while explaining his claims and backing up his ideas. Plus this book is a lot of fun to read.",13

Dagobert,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Taleb says the book practically wrote itself and it shows.,"Just listen to the publishers silly gushings:

""Taleb . . .administers a severe thrashing to MBA- and Nobel Prize-credentialed experts . . . roller-coaster passages, bordering on gleeful diatribes, on why experts are wrong. They neglect Taleb's metaphor of ""the black swan,"" whose discovery invalidated the theory that all swans are white.""

It's the poor Black Swan that takes the drubbing, beaten to senselessness by Taleb's tedious and rambling imputing of gravitas to a rather banal point of view. It was, for example, not at all a theory that all swans were white, it was an observation. So when a black swan showed up thousands of miles away, it did not turn science or anything else on its head, great thinkers did not leap from tall buildings, science was not reduced to a shambles, though Taleb would have us think so. That the appearance of occasional 'outliers', some of historic significance is the true engine of history is central to Taleb's thesis. If this perspective excites you, go ahead, read and admire it.

Kevin L. Nenstiel,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Read Kahneman, Not Taleb","I first encountered Nassim Taleb when another author cited his research on Long-Term Capital Management. LTCM, organized by two Nobel-winning economists, was predicted to have high returns on low risks outlasting the universe's lifespan. It imploded inside four years. Taleb's Black Swan theory putatively explains how LTCM, and similar fine-sounding organizations, fail so spectacularly. Inside forty pages, though, I realized: Taleb's busily calling the kettle black.

Humans, Taleb writes, fall victim to three-pronged delusional thinking: 1) we believe reality is comprehensible; 2) we construct explanations retrospectively, then apply them prospectively; and 3) we trust facts and experts inappropriately. I don't dispute this reasoning. This tripod of errors permits humans to believe we can control the uncontrollable. He compares this to black swans, a bird considered impossible, until ornithologists observed them in Australia. They're actually quite common.

However, I dispute what Taleb calls Black Swan Events. He believes life is conditioned, not by the knowable and the routine, but by the exceptional and the extreme. Because what we don't know vastly exceeds what we do know, reality constantly blindsides us. But we let myths of runaway success conceal harsher realities. Black Swan Events, Taleb writes, are the standard in everyday life, not the exception.

Maybe. But what Taleb calls Black Swan Events are seldom truly unpredictable. When people elect not to consider adverse likelihoods--say, by trusting ill-informed experts, or ignoring important countersigns--we perhaps can't predict exact outcomes, but we can predict specific themes. Wars, like the Lebanese Civil War that looms large in his mythology, appear unpredictable because we missed the signs. But that only proves *we* didn't predict them.

Taleb purports that human institutions hasten Black Sway Events, by risk-taking business ventures, or technological innovation. But that makes no sense. He purports we deliberately hasten the unpredictable, meaning we actually somehow predicted it. Perhaps Taleb means the Law of Unintended Consequences, though probably not. He seems to treat man-made technological innovation as an unpredictable factor. Admittedly, I had difficulty holding focus while some of his arguments ossified.

He even blatantly invents evidence. Smarter critics than me have balked at Taleb's story of Yevgenia Krasnova, a neuroscientist turned novelist whose quirky first novel confounded literary preconceptions worldwide. Her epic sprawls across multiple chapters; but Taleb fleetingly admits she's completely fictional. If Black Swan Events are common, couldn't he use somebody real, like J.K. Rowling or E.L. James, instead of inventing fake evidence? It makes his argument look untrustworthy.

Taleb appropriates a metaphor from Bertrand Russell to demonstrate his point. A turkey receives food, shelter, and other sustenance from humans. This happens every day, reinforcing the turkey's belief that humans nurture its best interests. Every repetition of this event deepens its belief that humans serve and protect it--until the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, when circumstances upend its every belief. We, Taleb says, follow that turkey's patterns every day.

Except... if turkeys were truly capable of inductive reasoning, as Taleb writes, that metaphor would collapse. The turkey could only follow Taleb's reasoning provided it had only tightly controlled data inputs. Any turkey raised not in isolation would notice Old MacDonald periodically carrying other turkeys outside the pen, never to return. It'd notice that, though well fed, it enjoyed no liberty to run or improve itself except in pre-approved ways.

Observant turkeys, therefore, would recognize that death occurs at intervals both regular and comprehensible. That's why industrial poultry factories raise turkeys in isolated concrete pens. Taleb's metaphor requires subjects not only unaware of adverse likelihoods, but maintained in deliberate ignorance. Anyone who's ever farmed recognizes that there's only two ways crop meat (assuming higher reasoning capability) wouldn't foresee imminent demise:

1. It wasn't paying attention.
2. Somebody kept it ignorant.

Briefly, we cannot operate without some expectation that past patterns provides reliable future indicators. If every time I've driven my truck safely doesn't predict the significant likelihood I'll drive safely tomorrow, I cannot make any informed decisions. Sure, my personal safety record doesn't preclude getting T-boned by drunks. But unless I drive NASCAR, the probability of extreme outliers is manageably small. Even NASCAR drivers have roll cages.

Despite his claims, Taleb doesn't truly describe Black Swan Events, situations that nobody could've predicted beforehand. Rather, he describes what Daniel Kahneman calls ""theory-induced blindness."" Because people had neatly packaged worldviews that excluded certain eventualities, people in key authority positions didn't see things coming, because they weren't looking. That doesn't mean these circumstances were unpredictable, just unpredicted. Lemme give just one example.

Taleb warns readers that excessive factual expertise can impede productive decisions. Well, Taleb's certainly unencumbered by facts. Directly after his turkey metaphor, he claims European citizens couldn't have predicted the Great War because they'd seen no real violence since the Napoleonic Wars, and nearly a century of uninterrupted peace had lulled Europeans into false security. That's so nakedly counterfactual, so ignorant of reality, informed Europeans should feel insulted.

Does Taleb believe Europeans didn't notice Bolivar's revolutions, the American Civil War, the Battles of Adwa, Solferino, and Omdurman, the Boer War, the Spanish-American War? At Königgrätz in 1866, Prussians armed with self-loading repeater rifles absolutely slaughtered Austria's army, finally ending Habsburg imperialism. At Shangani in 1893, seven hundred British troops armed with Maxim water-cooled automatic machine guns annihilated six thousand Matabele warriors, ending African independence for sixty years.

Thus, European powers rehearsed Great War strategies, perfected Great War technology, and cultivated Great War alliances, sometimes decades in advance. Often they did this on colonial expeditions, or through proxy powers; sometimes they practiced for the Great War on European soil, using European citizens. The Geneva Conventions arose, in 1864, because global war was possible. If leaders watched the signs, the Great War was entirely predictable; it just wasn't predicted.

European Cassandras feared the Great War, just as certain Americans feared the Great Recession. In both cases, powerful operators with theory-induced blindness squelched these concerns. Just because key lawgivers ignored what they considered impossible, doesn't make the eventualities any less probable beforehand. Leaders with partisan agendas started with their answers, and went in search of the questions. Taleb inadvertently describes humans' will to know, not humans' capacity to know.

I stopped reading after Taleb's Great War debacle. I didn't need to read further to understand his opinion-brokering couldn't bother with facts. If reality disagrees with his claims, he considers reality wrong--exactly the attitude he attributes to others. Between his disdain for facts, his own theory-induced blindness, and his glib mockery of others who disagree, I find Taleb smugly alienating. He won't let reality contradict a perfectly good theory.",15
Sampath Prakash,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Don't waste your time,"There are one or two good ideas and concepts in this book but by the time you finish reading this book you will forget it. The author is busy criticizing other successful economists and belittling their success. Every other line he will keep saying that using Gaussian distribution is a stupid idea.

I like books which take a central concept and take pains to explain well to the readers. Mr Taleb should first read a book like ""Made to Stick - by Chip and Dan Heath"" and learn how to communicate ideas.

The worst part of the book is Mr. Taleb's arrogance and snobbishness which come across loud and clear in every page. He seems to think that he deserves a Nobel prize, That sure will be a negative ""black swan"" event.

Robert David STEELE Vivas,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Absorbing and Truly Extraordinary--Essential for Those With Billions to Lose,"I come to this book later than the other reviewers, but I have seven pages of notes and my review will both summarize the book, and relate the critical knowledge of this genius author to our most pressing concerns. I've decided to do a very long review, as this is one of the most important books I have read in the last three years.

Bottom line: asset managers should focus on consequences, which can be known, rather than probability, which you cannot know.

Black Swan events are unpredictable, have a massive impact, and after the fact are ""explained"" in a manner that leads people to believe ""if we had only known X, we could have predicted.""

The author says that both 9-11 and Google are Black Swans. On 9-11, I think the author overlooks both the fact that it *was* predicted by the Hart-Rudman Commission, but I will delete other commentary in order to allow all of us to focus on this specific book and its huge importance.

On Google, the author is assuredly correct. No one could have foreseen that small investors would be so enthused by Google that today they are earning $1 for every $10 million in small investor cash they spend. No Wall Street firm would ever have made that mistake. Google may also be the first tri-fecta Black Swan, next and second, by devastating Wall Street when it consumes the banking, communications, entertainment, computer storage, and publishing industries (five years out, see the analytic study, ""Google 2.0: The Calculating Predator"" but if you don't find it via Google, use another engine--they are known to be manipulating what people see); and then third, when its computational mathematics, undocumented and without regulatory oversight, crashes unexpectedly and takes the economy down with it (ten years out) or, equally possible, every person on the planet uses CISCO AON to put the Googleplex out of business, and human social networks scale to the point that math is left behind.

This is quite an amazing work of pragmatic scholasticism. I am seriously impressed, and believe that this book is most valuable to the managers of asset portfolios, hedge funds, and pension funds. As the author himself notes, portfolio managers tend to exclude ""Black Swans"" as a risk.

In the author's view, Platoicity (Plato's Cave) mistakes the map for the terrain. I have found this problem endemic in the secret intelligence world, which would rather believe a satellite than a human on the ground. To illustrate the point: in one instance, the human reported an operational temperature of X and the satellite said Y. It turned out the satellite has been programmed to average the three different temperatures. It is that kind of mistake, buried deep in Google's computational mathematics, that should be scaring everyone to death right now, and especially Amazon, Apple, CISCO, IBM, Oracle, SAP, Motorola, and Nokia, not to mention banking and publishing and Hollywood.

The author, of Greco-Syrian descent from Levantine (he shares the disdain of Philip Atlee in The Health of Nations: Society and Law beyond the State for the concept of a nation-state, and I share his affection for Lebanon], tells us that the Earth requires us to have more imagination and not limit ourselves to what we can ""see"" and to historical extrapolation.

The triplet of opacity:
01 Illusion of understanding
02 Retrospective distortions
03 Overvaluation of factual information

He does not add corruption and other impeachable or indictable offenses that are all too common on Wall Street and in the White House as well as Congress. His crisis scenario is strictly objective and assumes good character among all concerned.

He says, ""History and societies do not crawl, they make jumps. They go from fracture to fracture, with a few vibrations in between.""

He says that other than diaries, which are true history as seen at the time by the subject, all history is absurd or biased, with clustering, categorization, and simplification, not to mention cultural and other biases.

He learned at Wharton directly from the most powerful CEOs on the planet that they literally do not know what is going on in the world (p. 17)

While the author worries about the highly improbably consequential event, I worry about the high probable consequential event that our political and economic elites refuse to acknowledge: Las Vegas running out of water, Exxon failing to invest in a five year Marshall Plan to cut oil needs in half, the elimination of chlorine, mercury, the restoration of Iowa corn to people instead of cattle, and so on.

Fascinating discussion of quant and platonic folds, by his own description a mix of mathematics, engineering, and statistics.

He concludes that we suffer from an inbred psychological and biological blindness, and I was pleased to see in the footnotes his recognition of E. O. Wilson, who in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge answered the question: ""Why do the sciences need the humanities?""

Black Swan is induction. See also Don Beck on abduction, Spiral Dynamics: Mastering Values, Leadership and Change.

+ Asset managers must be able to recognize cosmetic profits (or in the case of Google, cash outflow disparities in relation to cash inflow), and to discover hidden risks, e.g. in the case of Google, the forthcoming demise of the companies iterated above, and banks, if the current economic leaders do not come together and bring Google to the table in a deeper more candid manner than is now the case.

+ Empiricists without philosophers are dangerous, and vice versa.

Five sources of blunders:
01 Focus on pre-selected data
02 Fool ourselves
03 Human nature not programmed to imagine Black Swans
04 History hides many Black Swans, he calls this ""silent evidence. See also Fog Facts : Searching for Truth in the Land of Spin (Nation Books) and Lost History: Contras, Cocaine, the Press & 'Project Truth'
05 We tunnel, focus too narrowly.

The author is consistent with, but does not reflect, the Natural Capital Institute work on ""true cost,"" which corporations externalize by burning future sustainability for current profit. Consumers are now becoming aware, and I believe that ""true cost"" information delivered to the cell phone at the point of sale is going to change entire industries within five years.

+ We are 22 times too comfortable with what we know or do not know

+ Information is bad for knowledge. This is correct, but the author might enjoy a discussion about commercial intelligence (legal ethical decision support) in which tailored intelligence can kill a $5 billion deal or buy a future $10 billion value for $100 million. Since I founded OSS.Net in 1992, I have been saying that ""Information costs money, Intelligence makes money."" I believe that much good could come from merging the author's gifted analytic model, and the one that I have which studies the ten threats, twelve policies, eight global challengers, and also dissects indigenous environments along political-legal, military and law enforcement, socio-economic, ideo-cultural, technical-demographic, and natural-geographic. There are no short cuts in the commercial intelligence business, but there *are* very rewarding insights that all the others miss because they fail to ""cast a wide net."" See The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, & Political--Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs, & Corruption

I *really* like the author's discussion of false versus real experts. The government recruits experts based on their clearances, associations, locality, and convenience. I find experts based on citation analysis, direct examination, and referral What really grabbed me was the author's explicit inclusion of both stock traders and CIA intelligence analysts as false experts (p. 146). I am reminded of flying back from the Middle East with a World Bank executive for Africa who told me that the CIA analysts visiting him were young and inexperienced, and ""they put forward hypotheses that are frightening in their ignorance.""

The author quotes Bacon, saying most important advances are those ""lying out of the path of the imagination."" This is one reason I made ""Cast a Wide Net"" one of the rules for the new craft of intelligence. We need to be doing all information in all languages all the time, going back into history (e.g. tracking every Chinese statement on the Spratley Islands for the past 100 years).

He works from Hayek, who believes that a true forecasting system is done ORGANICALLY by a society or system, and that one single institution, neither CIA nor Google, can aggregate knowledge. I have been saying since 1992 that in the age of distributed information, ""central intelligence"" is an oxymoron. Same same Google.

I am provoked by the author into reflecting that while we cannot predict the future, we can shape it, and in choosing to obsess on secrecy, scarcity, war, and money, we have forsaken all we could have done by waging peace. See The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our World and The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project). The UN has told us we have 7 years to stop the growth of emissions from today (2007). That will not happen unless Wall Street recognizes the value of legal, ethical Commercial Intellligence, and the urgency of harmonizing the 12 policies against all 10 high-level threats, at the same time that we embrace the concerns of the eight major players (visit Earth Intelligence Network for the whole picture).

Some closing take-aways:

+ Distinguish between positive and negative contingencies.

+ Cast a wide net for weak signals, not a narrow net for strong signals.

+ Seize any opportunity, or anything that looking like an opportunity (I am still asking myself the question: what could IBM buy across the spectrum of emergent opportunities, in place or, or in addition to, Cognos?)

+ Beware of precise plans by any government.

+ Do not waste time fighting forecasters, stock analysts, economists, or social scientists.

+ The world is moving into extremeism where a small event can have cataclusmic effect.

+ The bell curve in gone.

+ Most large companies die. Only 75 remained in 1997 of the 500 in 1957.

+ Our business schools are training leaders for the past, not the present or near future.

+ We learned nothing from the LTCM bust. See chart on page 284, two ways to approach randomness.

He ends with a philosophical overview:

01 Micro minds cannot understand much less evaluate macro consequences.

02 Our economic and financial systems are BROKEN (Alvin Toffler would add, as are all our others systems--political, educations, media, religious, labor)

03 Non-commoditized thinking is good (oops...there goes Deloite et al)

This has been one of the most enjoyable, absorbing, and provocative reads I have had in some time. This is extraordinary thought, spanning a range of disciplines.

Michael Emmett Brady,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"An Excellent Blend of History,Philosophy,Probability,Economics,Statistics,and Mathematics","Taleb(T)has written an excellent book that should be required reading for every social scientist who bases his theoretical analysis, empirical work,and applied policy recommendations on the presumed use of the normal probability distribution.The use of the Normal distribution ,usually applied by social scientists,especially economists and psychologists, without any type of goodness of fit test, to their time series data,is the major reason for the predictive and forecast failures that occur with regularity in the social sciences.Taleb's message is that accurate and reliable prediction in the social sciences is not possible because of what Schumpeter called the "" regular irregularity ""problem of not being able to know,due to changing expectations,what the process or mechanism generating the stochastic time series data is.The social data being generated by the interaction of the ever changing mix of relevant social variables over time is not stable,uniform,and homogeneous over time due to constant financial, social,technological,political, and economic innovation and advance(or obsolescence and decay).Taleb's message is practically identical to the one that John Maynard Keynes delivered to Jan Tinbergen in 1939 and 1940 in their exchange in the Economic Journal over the logical(inductive and analogical) foundations of econometrics.Tinbergen sought to use the method of multiple correlation and regression based on least squares.Unfortunately,least squares is based on the assumption of normality( assume a normal probability distribution).Tinbergen,in his lifetime,never provided a goodness of fit test demonstrating that the time series data was, in fact,normally distributed.

At a much deeper philosophical and epistemological level,T explicitly shows how the social sciences ,over the last 130 years, have failed to grasp the limitations imposed on these fields by Hume's problem of induction.All social sciences have the severe problem that the interactions of human beings with each other in their physical environment constantly creates new combinations of possible outcomes that are not predictable or forseeable.T is correct that this problem is enormous and can't be dealt with by assuming some kind of probability distribution a priori,especially when the generating mechanism for the outcomes is constantly being changed by the very interactions of human decision makers with eachother brought about by reactions to previous forecasts or predictions that may have had some degree of reliability in the past.

I have one minor bone to pick with T.This is T's decision not to explicitly make use of the extremely powerful results presented by Keynes in 1921 in his A Treatise on Probability.Keynes spent all of Part III of this book on Hume's problem of induction and his partial solution in terms of an interval based approach to probability combined with his concept of the weight of the evidence,w.w measures the degree of the completeness of the relevant evidence upon which the probabilities are being calculated.Keynes always sought to differentiate between the highly improbable and the highly uncertain(or highly ambiguous a la Daniel Ellsberg).The highly improbable becomes a severe problem in all social sciences precisely because the weight of the evidence in these fields is relatively low in general.w must have a weight of 1(w is defined on the unit interval between 0 and 1,0<=w<=1) in order to support the claim that the probability distribution has a particular shape(i.e.,a bell shape)that will be applicable in the future.The presumption that the shape is bell shaped rules out BOTH the highly improbable(which Mandelbrot has shown for over 50 years occurs much more often than would be predicted by a normal distribution)and the highly uncertain or ambiguous.The use of Keynes's TP would have added support to T's sound conclusions.Perhaps he is planning to write another book in this area which would explicitly take Keynes's work into account.

T has demonstrated that the social sciences,particularly economics and psychology, are a mess.These fields assume continuity,independence,and stability,as well as the existence and uniqueness of supposed solutions without providing any empirical/experimental support for such claims.The entire foundation for social science must be rethought.The tool kit presently in use is not correctly measuring and/or describing what is actually occurring.Unfortunately,just as Keynes and Mandelbrot have been rejected,so will Taleb.This is because coming to grips with failure requires that the current practitioners realize that their methodology is not working and decide to change.This is precisely what the dominant academics in these fields refuse to do and will continue to refuse to do.They will simply continue to catalog an exploding number of anomalies that future researchers will supposedly have to deal with.",31
Jeffrey C Wartchow,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,The Black Swan,Way to technical for the average reader. This could have been written in fewer than 100 pages. Look up Black Swan on Wikipedia for a better synopsis.,1
Mark A. Moorstein,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Drowning Swan,"Thomas Kuhn in the History of Scientific Revolutions described the effects of anomalies in systems, regardless of whether one ""sees"" them or not. Sometimes one simply needs a new lens or filter to view a variable always there. Newtonian physics, which breaks down as an explanation of relativistic phenomena, becomes a functional part of Einsteinian physics when new variables (such as space-time) are revealed by logic and experimentation. In Frameworks: Conflicts in Balance, I described how Kuhn's observations apply not only to scientific frameworks, but to any framework, whether physical and metaphysical. Relevance becomes a mechanism (i.e. a lens or filter) of the human brain. Evolution itself depends on the application of some variables (such as genes) that turn on and turn off under appropriate circumstances.

Every framework contains a cluster of variables, rules, anomalies, zones of freedom and limits. In other words, Black Swans are simple anomalies, and a mere part of a larger framework dynamic. This observation began not with Taleb, but with the Greeks. Curiously, Taleb never even refers to Kuhn, or to those before him who observed many other characteristics related to change.

So I found Taleb's self-aggrandizing tome excessive in a number of ways. Each page was a celebration of ... Taleb, of how he was smarter than everyone in the universe, how everyone who failed to appreciate him was an idiot. While the idea of the Black Swan is a good one, it's not new. The unnecessary and hyperbolic jargon he applies (such as Extremistan) simply serves to confuse even sympathetic readers. As I recall from my college days, when you can't explain something simply, you dazzle them with BS. The book needs a filter --- there's too much Taleb and too few swimming birds.

I had great expectations for the book. But I just couldn't get past the ego. Frameworks: Conflict in Balance",28

For me, both add immeasurably to the discussion as to how the world may actually work. Thank you Mr. Taleb for taking the time and trouble to engage us in explanation and exposition.",27

At first I thought he was brilliant, but I was mistaken. He spends much of his time stroking himself over his own self professed mind shattering brilliance when all the while committing most, if not all of the self referential, circular, post hock, confirmation error nonsense he bitterly accuses others of.

Apparently confirmation bias is only correct when he does it, everyone else is too stupid, or ignorant to understand what he sees clearly.

""Proof"" consists of statements like "" I couldn't think of a single linear relationship"" ( paraphrased ) I guess he's never taken a high school physics class ( Nassim, check out Hook's Law...Jackass )

Some of it isn't completely stupid, but at best it's a somewhat interesting introduction to basic philosophy, and how he commits the logic errors he's just defined.

It's practical application is virtually nonexistent.

In one sentence the book is him saying ""We don't know what we don't know and therefore can't reliably act on our ignorance."" NO S&$T!!! This book could have been one sentence.

Lots of things are unknown, and unknowable can you say ""location AND rotation"" Mr. Taleb?

This book is about as relevant to your everyday existence and decision making as Relativistic time dilation is to riding your bike SLOWLY versus standing still. That's not at all, in any real sense, in case that's something unknown to you Nassim.

I haven't finished the book YET (42% through ) and finishing it is hard ( and a waste of time ) because he keeps alienating me with crappy reasoning a poorly constructed arguments absent of any demonstrable proof.

Such is the luxury afforded to anyone writing a book about what we don't/he doesn't know.

CriticalReview,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Best Selling Hubris Charlatan,"In this book Nassim (as ""Fat Tony"") claims straight ""A"" Electrical Engineers (EE ""Dr. John"") are slow, suckers, commodities, in the box thinkers, and don't know anything about a coin toss probability. Well, how about if the coin lands on its edge? No, Nassim didn't even mention that, and the EE in his book, ""Dr. John"", didn't even mention that, but he would of rounded it to 50%, as most any practical intelligent person would. Well, Nassim says the coin is ""fair"", but when it is not fair, then he seems to lie, because he seems to not understand that engineers to engineers are honest people because engineers are judged by physics not by fallible hubris people like ""Fat Tony"" who don't realize that rare events do happen naturally, and that a coin, if actually fair, can land on one side many times before landing on the other. This is how planes end up landing safely, they are designed this way, to handle the rare events, and recover, based on known probabilities, but here is Nassim, as ""Fat Tony"" who claims he knows when he does not know.

Engineers are not liars because engineers are governed by physics not by how many people they can fool, and because straight A EE's are not suckers, not commodities, and they are not in the box thinkers, they do the work slowly so that people don't die because of the catastrophic consequences of certain engineering failures, and to belittle such people makes Nassim look like a pathetic hooligan who has severe self esteem issues, but I am not surprised to see this from a person who believes in an invisible man in the sky who created the universe, and I imagine that Nassim talks to this invisible man. Perhaps because Nassim is completely incapable of achieving straight A's in electrical engineering, he chooses to try to bring these very people down, the very people who achieved straight A's to save lives by their dedication to knowledge of physics, and their incredible humility by continual self questioning at verifying that critical electrical systems are designed correctly under the laws of physics and not under how many people they can fool.

Nassim reminds me of the technologically narcissistic people Louis C.K. describes in this video ""Everything's Amazing Nobody's Happy""

[...]

Talk about being extremely jealous of people who actually produce useful things, such as designing fly-by-wire flight controls, radar systems for assisting aircraft in landing in total darkness in the fog, or providing defibrillator machines to restart your heart, or MRI imaging technology, or the computer you read this comment on, the light at your desk, countless other technologies brought to you by electrical engineers, yeah, let's just ignore these poignant facts now shall we, and just say all this technology was created from in the box thinking? Yeah, right.

I at least give Nassim credit for mentioning in his book that we made it possible to walk on the Moon, but such false credence given to common belittling of the people who made it possible, it is no wonder we have not gone further since 1972.

Nassim hides in his vocabulary used in ""Black Swan"" and his other book ""Antifragile"" points out nothing substantially new nor useful. Not even the standard American Century Dictionary of more than 60,000 entries contains many of the purposely obfuscated words Nassim uses to hide behind to make himself look credible and appear intelligent when he is not.

The best selling titles ""Black Swan"" is nothing more than low probability events, and ""Antifragile"" is nothing more than adaptation. Nassim implicitly claims predicting things in his book that were already predicted as if he is special or something, such as claiming to imagine planes flying into buildings before Sept. 11, 2001 when in fact a TV drama (such as ""The Pilot"" on ""The Lone Gunman"") presented a similar event before hand, and it already happened with a B-25 and the Empire State Building even longer before in 1945. And about the banking crisis, when the whole system is based on copying money over and over again, that was well predicted in advance by many books as a house of cards, documentaries and news reports well in advance, again, nothing new at all, but narcissistic Nassim decided to mention this in his book.

The bottom line is Nassim is a best selling charlatan, and yeah, I was a sucker for buying his book, never again from this guy, ever, I would never trust this man with the time of day!

I give him 1 star, because Amazon does not allow zero stars, for being best selling fiction that looks like science, when it is not new, and nothing special, and if Nassim really was an out of the box thinker, he would of called it a ""Chimera Swan"", but as a scientist, it would have the dry title as ""Rare Events"", but Nassim wants to be a scientist when he is not, desperate to get a Noble Prize of which no wonder he did not. He is just another case where the hubris have the biggest best selling voice in our society, and who get rewarded the most for it.

T SANTOSO,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Better Than Fooled By Randomness. A Must Read.,"Added on 11 August 2007:

The book is still pretty and interesting at second read. I reread the book for doing a local review (for SWA - Famous Indonesian Business Magazine), and feel elevated again. I think i even grasp something more and enjoy it very much.

I come to think that most of things really do happen with some high portion of randomness. And the Black Swan is something that always happen even at the very small probablility.

Books often available a bit late at this part of the earth, except Harry Potter 7, haha so, I always review books that are somewhat a bit old ( give a couple of months before good selling books are imported).

This book is not easy to read, and does need some concentration. It has one big concept, the Black Swan, but has plenty of small anecdotal stories that wrap well around the whole narative.

If this kind of book makes the New York Time Bestseller list for quiet a while, it is definitely worth reading. Yah, BTW Nassim's success in wrinting is a Black Swan by itself.

=======================================
Original review:

The long awaited book after the Fooled by Randomness finally arrived at my lap (this is Surabaya, Indonesia) brought by DHL, such a happy moment. I have been afraid that the second book will not be as attractive as the former, but I m wrong! This one has a better NARRATIVE ;-), and still contain so much information and thoughts that often force you to put the book doen and think.

Fooled by Randomness is a Black Swan, so does The Black Swan, things Highly Improbable, a rare event, highly sellable book that is highly intelectual as well. The book contains Hume, Popper, Plato, Kahneman and Tversky, combined with Nassim own story and life. All deliciously weaved into a readable fabric that will glue you to your seat (or bed! In mycase) for days.

There are three type of books: The How To book, the book that will show you how to do something, The Motivational book aka Self Help, and books that ""Change The Way You See Things"", a perspective change book, such as this one. Books that make you rethink your own perspective and change the way you see life.

With strange chapter title like ""Umberto Eco's Antilibrary"" (How to seek validation) to ""Living in the Antechamber of Hope"", you got a chockfull of delicious stuffs, in a sense like ""Bitter Sweet Chocolate"" ( and NOT Milk Chocolate), which for certain type of people will be the ultimate delicious read.

A warning: this is not an easy read in the usual term, although that this is an easier read compare to Fooled By Randomness and I predict that this book will go to the ""best selling"" fame and glory. You have to digest and think to get the full impact. For easier read, you can read ""The Halo Effect"" (finished in a day) which is also a great book with similar line of thought.

I thank Nassim for such an enjoyable reading week ( I read fast, yet it took a week, to finish this) which has sharpen my mind and see life in a more ""correct"" way. My wife keep complaining that I mention too much of ""Randomness"" and ""Black Swans"" lately during our life's activities. Gosh! The Effect of a great book.",28

Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,An improbable review?,"I agree with other reviews that this is a poor follow on to ""Fooled by Randomness."" I've found myself skipping sections and not missing anything.

Mostly this book is soaked with the author's extreme arrogance. And it is nothing more than listening to a babbling know-it-all. The type of guy that you get stuck talking to at a party until you start praying for a fire alarm.

As a scientist, I don't agree with the notion that an outlier event disproves a hypothesis or central tendency statistics. It merely proves that outliers exist and mathematical models are attempts to predict and are often flawed. Duh, we already knew that.

Further, the whole notion that no one could have predicted the internet or Google is absurd. We've seen them grow--and participated in that growth. How is that improbable and unpredictable?

The book is mildly engaging at times, and apparently I'm one of the few that disliked it. Maybe my PhD made me too dumb to understand.",105
takingadayoff,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,An Ugly Duckling,"Oh dear. If you've read Taleb's previous book, Fooled By Randomness, don't bother with The Black Swan. Fooled By Randomness was deservedly successful, filled with contrarian thinking that makes sense, delivered in an original and engaging style. But success went to Taleb's head. In The Black Swan, Taleb seems more interested in talking about himself. He doesn't do his reputation any favors by doing so. He describes what he seems to think of as charming quirkiness, nearly giving an octogenarian Nobel Prize laureate a heart attack by heckling him at a lecture. Taleb loves to take blowhards down a notch or two. But when someone challenges his ideas, it's because they haven't read his book, or they didn't understand his brilliance.

The Black Swan jumps around, switching from a tale of a non-existent Russian author to Taleb's experiences in Lebanon to the mathematics of probability. The language is repetitive, using ""black swan"" and ""extremistan"" long after their cuteness has worn off.

Read Fooled By Randomness or Devil Take the Hindmost or Fortune's Formula. Read Harry Potter. Anything but The Black Swan.",159
Patrick L. Boyle,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Vastly Entertaining,"Why do I give a book I call ""Vastly Entertaining"" only one star? Taleb likes to demonstrate his contempt for journalists by calling them mere entertainers. This is one of his best insights. I'm often reminded when I see the ""body language"" expert on Bill O'Reilly's show of Sybil The Soothsayer from the prophetic movie ""Network"". Taleb himself is an entertainer although he might dispute such a characterization. He likes to portray himself the one wise man in a sea of fools. He fashions himself a deep thinker who is cultured and sophisticated unlike the boring MBAs he has to deal with. He is ""a legend in his own mind"".

In the first book ""Fooled by Randomness"" he argues that too much editing by book publishers spoils the author's unique style and cadence. The consequence of this opinion is that that book is very poorly written. The Black Swan is better written or better edited. It is much easier to follow. The first book had very few ideas and not many citations. It was personal. We learned a lot about Taleeb - not so much about randomness. The first book is personal. It reads like musings by a man who thought a lot about math and the way it is used in commerce. This second book is rather different. I reads like an issue of ""Psychology Today"". It is a compilation of research anecdotes from the literature. These stories are mostly entertaining. Taleeb the journalist.

What I learned from Taleeb is that a good living can be made from being a pop guru. He admires Alfred Korzybski and Malcolm Gladwell both of whom wrote this kind of pseudo scientific bestseller that appeals to the reader's vanity. Gladwell you may remember is the genius who assures his readers that they could have been as rich as Gates or as influential as Mozart if they had just practiced more. Korzibski wrote that war, discord and mental illness were just bad grammar.

The great joy of reading this book is to uncover for yourself all the errors. I will confine myself to three examples. Taleeb at one point illustrates some point or other by invoking the Maginot Line. He says the Line showed the stupidity of the French because the clever Germans just went around it. The French indeed made mistakes but the Maginot Line did exactly what it was supposed to do - make the Germans go around. The French never expected the fixed fortification to completely block the Germans - that would have been very stupid. The Line was supposed to channel the expected German tank led invasion to the west where they could oppose them on more favorable ground. The French tanks at the time were more numerous and advanced than the German. The Maginot Line worked as intended it was the French tank doctrine that failed. This is a shocking missunderstanding of history from someone who tells us on every page how much smarter he is than everyone else.

The second example is all the puffery about the normal distribution. He thinks it's evil or at least a major source of man's suffering on this earth. He refers to it as another example of Platonism. Apparently the ""ideal form"" of the normal curve has seduced many into error. How silly. How Platonic.

He claims that people who have never taken a course in statistics are better off for not having been mislead by the Gaussian distribution. Notice that this is an assertion about the external world but he makes no effort to demonstrate it empirically. Taleeb is an empiricist only to the extent that it allows him to disparage others. It never occurs to him to actually test any of his own assertions. I guess he doesn't watch ""Mythbusters"" on TV.

All he really does is demonstrate that if you use the wrong math tool you get into trouble. What a revelation! The normal curve is found in frequency distributions. Taleeb mostly uses examples from times series analysis. If someone confuses these two very different analysis domains he will indeed usually be wrong. Taleeb knows all this very well. One wonders if he's being sincer or if he's just engaging in hyperbole to sell books.

All his exhortations about learning statistics makes very little sense. Beginning stat students come to the first class armed with knowledge of how to multiply, add, subtract and divide. They all know about percentages even if they can't calculate them very well. The only real analytical tool they have is the ability to calculate an average. If they are attentive at the end of the class they will learn that the arithmetic mean is sometimes the wrong tool. They will learn that differences between two results may or may not be meaningful. They may learn correlation isn't causation. All these insights are useful but elementary. MBA students enter their first stat class not knowing much math and leave it knowing only a little bit more. That's the reality. Taleeb doesn't want to cure the ignorance he wants to exploit it. Exploitation of ignorance is fine with me as a trading strategy. But Taleeb no longer trades. He quit trading and went into the guru business.

My final example is with his strategy for trading. He prides himself with his deep thinking. He lectures businesspeople about how much randomness and unpredictability there is in the market. At one point he tells us how his lecture attendees often ask him for his sophisticated trading strategy that he developed in the light of his understanding of randomness. He says with ill conceived contempt - they didn't really understand me if they asked such a question. Of course from the attendees viewpoint they want to know what is the payoff for enduring this blowhard's bloviation. When they find out that he has no formula and no worthwhile advice for making money they get mad.

In the first book he tells a long story about how his neighbor across the street made much more money than he did but eventually lost everything in an unexpected market downturn. He hints at how his superior knowledge and appreciation of randomness saved him from a similar fate. In his second book - The Black Swan - he divulges his formula. He doesn't bet all his money every time. He keeps a lot of his working funds in treasury bonds. So he can lose all his ""play"" money and still pay his mortgage when a Black Swan event happens. Maybe I should have issued a spoiler alert. That's it. That's the punchline. Don't bet more than you can afford to lose.

His neighbor seemed to bet all his funds every time. When his luck was rolling his way he got rich. When his luck turned bad he lost everything. Taleeb has no insight into how to see a Black Swan coming - he makes it clear that that is impossible. And his only advice is to not commit everything you have. He survived the Black Swan turn down because he never used all his funds. Limiting your risk exposure isn't bad advice but readers and lecture attendees expect a whole lot more.

Taleeb believes that there is no way beat randomness except by refusing to be exposed to it. He lives his own advice. He played in the market long enough to benefit from good luck but quit before the bad luck had a chance to wipe him out. Now he writes books and gives lectures. But I already knew that gambling led to trouble. It's called ""Gambler's Ruin"".",117

F. Mullen,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,Wading through Mediocristan,"To get to the substance of ""The Black Swan,"" you must first get beyond the author's overweening self-regard. But when you have done that--if indeed you can--you find there is very little substance after all. Much of the book is little more than the author's confession of worldliness and refinement. We are guided to understand that he is at once immersed in man's strife-torn existence (""This is not an autobiography, so I will skip the scenes of war"") and steeped in les belles lettres (""My point, I repeat, is not that Balzac is untalented, but that he is less uniquely talented than we think""). What arguments he makes regarding ""black swans""--rare events with outsized impact--are mostly arguments of assertion rather than demonstration, and what insights he provides into the nature of these events are far from profound. In most cases they are but a short distance removed from common sense.

Nonetheless, some readers may enjoy the spectacle of a grown man displaying the sort of braggadocio not normally seen in males above age fourteen. It is lowbrow entertainment to watch the pompous make asses of themselves, but it is still entertainment. And pomposity is in every chapter of the book. Do you have any idea how many world cities Nassim Nicholas Taleb sips coffee in? No? Voila, he will tell you! New York, Beirut, Lugano, Rome, Paris, Athens, Venice, Sydney, and many more! ""I was transiting through the Frankfurt airport on my way from Oslo to Zurich. I had time to kill and it was a great opportunity for me to buy dark European chocolate....""

Or, do you know how many languages Nassim Nicholas Taleb speaks? No? Voici, he will tell you this too! French, Arabic, English.... Alas, his Italian is weak, so he augments it with hand gestures. And Latin: ""I am carrying Seneca on all my travels, in the original, as I relearned Latin--reading him in English did not feel right. It would be equivalent to reading Yeats in Swahili."" The author's only nod to modesty here is that he did not then claim to have actually read Yeats in Swahili.

Taleb's erudition in language is at the heart of one of the most egotistically comical paragraphs of the book. During a meeting with his close friend, Benoit Mandelbrot, Taleb recounts that,

""Mandelbrot mentioned one of his friends, the aristocratic mathematician Marcel-Paul Schutzenberger [who] insisted on the clear cut distinction in the French language between `hasard' and `fortuit.' We went to the Petit Robert dictionary. `Fortuit' seems to correspond to my epistemic opacity, `l'imprevu et non quantifiable'; `hasard' to the more ludic type of uncertainty that was proposed by the Chevalier de Mere in the early gambling literature. Remarkably, the Arabs may have introduced another word ....""

If you had a Petit Robert yourself, you might be tempted to look up ""poseur.""

Oh, yes, the substance. These ""black swans"" are statistical outliers, and thus invite a discussion of statistical modeling and its application to the real world. This the author provides, sort of, in chapters 15-17. Here he proposes to be technical (""The nontechnical reader can skip this chapter...,"" he helpfully cautions), maybe even mathematical. But beyond the not very surprising demonstration that the tail of a bell curve becomes miniscule more quickly than that of a power-law curve of modest degree, there is little in here that passes for analysis. There is a discursion into the fractal geometry of Mandelbrot, however, and a none-too-clear assertion that power-law distributions are scalable (true) and therefore ""Mandelbrotian"" (I suppose so). All this might make sense on some level, but it is not a demonstration of the superiority of power laws or the inferiority of the bell curve. It seems rather to be a flattering tribute to his friend Mandlebrot.

In chapter 17 the knives come out. Here Taleb takes on ""Locke's Madmen,"" those benighted economists who at some point foolishly used the bell curve in their modeling and analysis. These include Paul Samuelson. Of him and three other notables Taleb says, ""All four were Nobeled. All four were in a delusional state under the effect of mathematics...."" I'm quite certain that Taleb knows more about economics than I do. I am even more certain that Samuelson does. To me this is an intra-disciplinary feud, which, at bottom, seems to be the reason for the book. It is the rant of an iconoclast against orthodoxy.

The book is not without value. There are very sensible observations on the inability of most gamblers to realistically imagine the odds against them, for example, the unintended consequences of government regulation, and the wisdom of not permitting economic entities to become ""too big to fail."" There are practical illustrations of statistics that do not fit the bell curve: distribution of income, for example. There are also a number of bons mots scattered throughout the book: calling egalitarianism ""the glorification of mediocrity,"" and observing that ""Forecasting by bureaucrats tends to be used for anxiety relief rather than for adequate policy making."" But it is doubtful that the discovery of these baubles, whatever their value as wisdom or amusement, is worth wading through the rest of Mediocristan.",231

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"Many important ideas, many flaws that detract from the message","This is an entertaining and enlightening book, and fairly easy to read. It has an important message regarding how the world works; that the world is governed not by the predictable and the average, but by the random, the unknownable, the unpredictable -- big events or discoveries or unusual people that have big consequences. Change comes not uniformly but in unpredictable spurts. These are the Black Swans of the title: completedly unexpected and rare events or novel ideas or technologies that have a huge impact on the world. Indeed, Taleb argues that history itself is primarly driven by these Black Swans.

It is convincing argument, entertainingly presented with plenty of sarcasm, and indeed, anger, by Taleb. For example he rails against the academic community, economists (including specific names), and Nobel Prize committee. Considerable numbers of his arguments ""ring true"" to me, that is my experience in life confirms that they are more accurate than the traditional approach. Like any important work, 90% of what is in the book is not original; that does not make it less important. Taleb's contribution is in integrating the material together, and showing how these different ideas are tied to the Black Swan.

The themes include: winner-take-all phenonomen, numerous effects of randomness on the world, the invalidity of the Gaussian Bell Curve to most things in world, concepts of scalablity, numerous instabilities in the world, especially the modern world where information travels so quickly, the fallacies about people's inability to predict the future. The importance of these ideas, Taleb's ability to weave them together into a single theory, and the ability of this theory to change the way you look at the world, means the book easily deserves my highest recommendation.

However, the book does have many flaws, unfortunately -- unfortunate because I believe they will take away from the credibility of the message, which is in important one. The are numerous minor flaws such as, for example, the inexplicable invention of a fictional author (disclosed a few pages later), when certainly there must have been some real example that would have worked better. Another example is repeated jabs about the French; these may be amusing but I just don't think they have a place in work like this. There are also diatribes against specific people, including famous economists, which, though amusing, and possibly justified, demonstrate a high level of anger by author and take away from his credibility. Often he also overreaches, for example in saying the usual combination of anti-abortion and pro-death penalty or the opposite combined views of pro-abortion and anti-death penatly cannot be explained logically, when in fact widely known theories such as George Lakoff's (in Moral Politics) have explained hows these groups of views are entirely consistent.

Another flaw is that Taleb seems to go a little toward the extreme of saying that we can predict almost nothing about the future, and though he does not say so explicitly, this seems to imply we have no moral responsibility to the future. This, combined with Taleb's advice to the reader about their behavior based on the ""Black Swan"" view of world just rubbed me the wrong way, for several reasons. One is that Taleb personally has very little in common with most people; never having as far as I know had a regular career (essentially what he calls non-scalable, e.g. dentist, engineer, baker) he nevertheless recommends that people choose these kinds of careers rather than a scalable career (e.g. financial trader, author, actor which are subject to a few lucky successful people and a lot of failures). This advise is odd first because Taleb is in a non-scalable profession (derivatives trader, then hedge fund manager) -- indeed it appears he is quite wealthy. Even more odd because he says all these types of non-scalable types of work are boring and evens makes sarcastic comments (the book is extremely sarcasm heavy) for example about dentists being able to do well by diligently drilling teeth for 30 years. The second things that bothered me is that Taleb seems be somewhat amoral to me; in this type of book where plenty of his own emotions come through, plenty of his personality, he has plenty of criticism of others for their wrong models and wrong view of the world, and how this has hurt the world, but there remains a lack of moral responsibility to his advice.

Perhaps the best comparison I could make are to other important works that do not suffer from these flaws, for example the Age of Fallibility by George Soros and Irrational Exuberance by Robert Shiller (1st and 2nd editions). But probably Black Swan will sell better than either of these because of it's ""edginess,"" i.e. aggresiveness; I personally have a distaste for this approach.

The principles of the book are quite simple.

The unknown is more frequent than we tend to think.

The effect of unexpected things is rather huge. Much more than we dare to fantasize.

""we know"" is in many cases a big illusion. The human mind tends to think it knows, but does not always have solid ground for this dellusion of ""I know"".

As in the good old medieval days, ""experts"" are many times empty heads with empty (and expensive) suits. The ""truth"" behind science, is limited to some areas, and in many areas having a degree and posing scienist, is truth irelevant.

""Narrative falacy"" talks about our tendency to build stories around facts. In love it may serve a purpose, but when starting to beleive the stories and accomodating facts to the stories, things become stupid.

T. Nield,5.0 out of 5 stars,IT's hidden face: Everything you always wanted to know about Information Technology. A look behind the scenes,Business Literature of Epic Proportions,"""If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer, a Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, get a million miles per gallon, and explode once a year, killing everyone inside."" - Excerpt quote from Robert X Cringely

This book is a business reading of epic proportions. It redefines the entire worldview as businesses increasingly rely on technology to be competitive and innovative, and yet IT projects continuously fail to deliver. We are at a defining moment in economic history: will we fully harness the power of technology to make our businesses better and smarter, or will it run amok always threatening risk of catastrophe? Nowadays, the most effective way for any business to innovate seems to be through technology, so the pressure is on!

The author does a phenomenal job painting a picture of everything wrong with the I.T. world, including its operations, management, principles, and culture. The practical as well as global awareness I gained from just this book is phenomenal. I feel like I can see through the smoke and mirrors I have spent years trying to figure out when dealing with our IT project managers.

My only criticism is while the author does an incredible job describing the problems, he does not really put forth a solution. He instead says it will ""take decades to play out"" for I.T. to reach maturity. He suggests that one day, maybe an innovative I.T. vendor will solve the riddle to make things work. I disagree. For a book that riffs I.T. vendors constantly, I'm surprised he's still looking for a cure from the hair of the dog. The catalyst will be innovation from within. You should outsource where it economically makes sense, yes. But in this era, outsourcing to IT vendors who in turn outsource, then outsource, then outsource again (all the way to India!) is not the solution. The author says himself it is perverse to think technology can be commoditized. What we really need is somebody to step up and defy the prevailing attitude of ""this is the way things are"".",1
Ramon Jimenez,4.0 out of 5 stars,IT's hidden face: Everything you always wanted to know about Information Technology. A look behind the scenes,"Good ideas, not so good form","I'm an IT professional. I got this book after reading some juicy excerpts from it on a Web site I frequent. The book really shows it's written by someone with deep, in-the-trenches experience. It provides a thorough overview of a modern IT organization structure and day-to-day operations, mixed with a couple of really good and insightful ideas.

Thus, from the substance side, it is rather good. However, the form tends to be poor. Not only is it obviously suffering from translation woes (not that I speak German, but English is not my first language and I tend to notice translation issues in general); it also lacks coherence at times. Trying to be benevolent, I thought to myself that the book was indeed written by a large bank's CIO, jotting scattered notes between never-ending meetings. But seriously, it could benefit from better editing.

In the end, if you are an IT professional, you may feel that the book does little more than describe what you do and add to your despair about the profession's sad state. I am also rather surprised about the rave reviews the book includes from several European magazines, claiming the book may fix the gap between business and IT almost by itself.

Try, however, to look aside at the book's obvious shortcomings, and you'll in fact find a very valuable message targeted at IT: we must honestly, brutally and vocally communicate to the business what it really costs to properly run IT in terms of effort and commitment, what a generalized mess is the state of commercially available business software, and how high the stakes are in such an immature discipline. Real, positive change for all parties involve may begin to emerge from it - certainly not miraculous and immediate, but it should set the tone for fruitful action.",2

Ethan Bienstock,4.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods,This textbook does an excellent job developing the mathematics and providing intuition behind SVMs,"This textbook does an excellent job developing the mathematics and providing intuition behind SVMs. That being said, This textbook assumes you have a firm grasp on vector calculus and linear algebra. Chapters 1 and 2 provide a good overview of how machine learning can be used in classification and linear regression. Chapter 5 is an overview of what is covered in most introductory multivariate calculus classes. However, chapter 3 and chapter 4 are not easy. If you lack a background in real analysis you can read the first four or five pages of each chapter and get a basic idea of what is being discussed. Some of the proofs could use a bit more explanation, but at the same time they are mathematically rigorous and concise.

Lastly, the author makes mention that you can read the book out of order. Here's the order that I read: chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 5, chapter 3, chapter 6, chapter 4, chapter 8, and then chapter 7. I think this order gave me enough background information and motivated me to delve into the mathematical theory.

Sandro Saitta,4.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods,More for mathematicians than computer scientist,"This book introduces the concepts of kernel-based methods and focuses specifically on Support Vector Machines (SVM). It is hard to read and a good background in mathematic is clearly needed. The book has a strong emphasis on SVM starting from the very first line of text. Concepts are well explained, although equations are not clear. The notation doesn't facilitate the reading at all. The book covers linear as well as kernel learning. The kernel trick is well described. It is easy to understand ideas behind SVM while reading the corresponding chapter. Finally a small chapter on SVM applications is proposed. Unfortunately, it only contains typical SVM applications (i.e. standard problems).

I think this book is good if you:

* Have a strong mathematical background

* Work in the specific domain of SVM (or kernel-based methods in general)

* Want to write a research paper about SVM and need the correct notations

* Don't like to read theorems, corollaries and remarks

* Are not interested in reading hundreds of proofs

It's a great and inspiring read.

It's highly readable though, requiring no technical knowledge, and one of those titles (like Dawkins' Selfish Gene) that makes the reader feel like a genius as the layers unfold. It focuses on the details of making a single individual as sophisticated as possible rather than the approach taken by most comparable researchers, who hook together 'creatures' driven by a few simple rules, apply those to a large population and let 'emergent' processes do the rest and generate complex outcomes. It's true - looking at ants in the real world, and various a-life programs created, you do indeed get interesting and unforeseen complexities from a large population of super simple organisms. But every increase in the sophistication of the individual creatures will have exponential benefits in how rich the outcomes will be from a population of them!

I made two attempts to learn R before purchasing this book. In both previous attempts, I had to abort and use another tool to solve my problem because it was taking me too long to accomplish very simple things in R.

The reason R is hard to learn is that its documentation is organized for statisticians that already know R, but have forgotten a detail or two. There are a few other books on learning R, but they are setup like a college course - complete the entire book and THEN you can actually accomplish something.

R in a Nutshell allows you to get working immediately. Simply lookup what you need to do. The firsts thing I did was load a file and make a histogram. I found that stuff in the section on ""Loading Data"" and the section on charts. In no time I was making stacked area charts for cohorts.

First, let me just say that I bought 2 copies of this book practically as soon as it was in print based solely on my past experience with O'Reilly books. One for home and one for the office. I was expecting a ""go-to"" book that I could pick up whenever I need a quick, but thorough, reference to some aspect of R programming. I thought that's what the O'Reilly Nutshell series is all about, but I should have waited as this is NOT what I was expecting.

The book covers a lot of ground without much depth. From the Table of Contents it looks like it's all here, but when I actually get into the material I find it lacking. R and all its packages is huge: there has to be less material in a printed reference than what is available online through CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network: cran.r-project.org) or many other sources. But this book reads more like the introductions of major topics rather than a vetted reference. There are just too many important details completely missing. For example, nowhere in the entire book is even a short description of the R workspace or how your project files are organized and stored by the R system.

In my opinion Part IV, ""Statistics with R,"" should have been left out entirely. The space could have been better devoted to the details missing in the first 3 sections covering the language and system pragmatics. Instead, what we have are very basic intro's to common statistics and machine learning models. Maybe a better alternative would have been a single chapter that provides an overview of the myriad packages and algorithms available to the R programmer. Certainly a reference to CRAN's ""Task View"" page would be in order?

As I said, R is huge. A true ""Nutshell"" book would be invaluable to me and I'm sure many other R programmers. That's what O'Reilly books are renowned for. Unfortunately, this is not the one for R.

XY,4.0 out of 5 stars,Theory of Decision under Uncertainty (Econometric Society Monographs),interesting,"Given the book's title, I was surprised at the extent to which the book deals with ""decision making under risk"" rather than ""decision making under uncertainty."" I agree that the standard terminology is very poor (like much of the terminology in the information sciences), but since this book is directed at readers already exposed to some decision theory, I think that the standard taxonomy should be respected.

The author's definitions of 'normative' and 'irrational' struck me as rather odd, being entirely subjective. I would have appreciated a bit more attention to this subject, although admittedly this risks getting side-tracked into messy philosophical considerations. The author also often fails to explain the extent to which material provided represents an advance over previous work. This may be obvious to experts; to me it was less so.",7
Herbert Gintis,4.0 out of 5 stars,Theory of Decision under Uncertainty (Econometric Society Monographs),"Good Technical Expositions, Interesting Spins","Itzhak Gilboa is a very talented, broad-thinking, yet technically super-competent economist who has spent his career mulling over the problems addressed in this book. The technical material in this book is not very technical, and can be understood independent from the reader's mathematical training, although it does require a willingness to think deeply about analytical issues. The models Gilboa presents are not new, but they are presented in an attractive manner, and it is rare to see so many different aspects of the rational choice process presented between two covers.

I have long been a strong (my friends would say vociferous, my detractors stubborn) supporter of rational decision theory, while being clear about its limits and suggesting ways forward in broadening the model. My central claim is that the rational actor model is the most important analytical tool ever discovered for modeling human decision-making, and behavioral disciplines that reject this model, such as sociology and cognitive/social psychology, thereby relinquish the possibility of having core theories of decision-making and strategic interaction. I also believe that those who reject the model do not understand it and use arguments against it that are not only fallacious, but always (yes, always!) ignorant and even embarrassing. This book will thus give potential critics a solid grounding in the theory they so love to dump on.

Gilboa himself comes across in this slim volume as a kinda' hang-loose guy who is willing to entertain all sorts of objections to the theory, and to defend rational choice rather more weakly than I would like. Most important, Gilboa rather takes at face value the critiques emanating from the Kahneman-Tversky camp of experimentalists, who have so brilliantly documented the various weaknesses of standard rational decision theory. My own take on these experimental results is far more skeptical (see Chapters 3 and 12 of my book, The Bounds of Reason).. Let me give one example.

Gilboa discusses the famous ""Linda the Bank Teller"" example (p. 37ff). ""Linda is 31 years old,"" we are told by the experimenter, ""single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and she participated in antinuclear demonstrations. Rank order the following eight descriptions in terms of the probability (likelihood) that they describe Linda."" Included in the list of eight are the following:
(c) Linda is a bank teller, and
(h) Linda is a bank teller who is active in a feminist movement.
Surprisingly, many subjects rank (h) as more likely than (c), despite that fact that the probability of (h) must be much smaller than that of (c)---the latter probability is always strictly smaller, unless every bank teller is a feminist (which is absurd).

Gilboa, like Kahneman and Tversky, agree that this is quite illogical behavior on the part of subjects. However, I argue in Bounds of Reason that the subjects are correct and the experimenters are incorrect. Here is the argument. In normal discourse, when we are talking to someone, we expect what they say to be relevant to the conversation. E.g., if we are discussing how to buy tickets for a concert, it would be bizarre for you say ""my cousin George had half a banana with his cereal for breakfast last Wednesday."" In light of this, what is the subject supposed to think when give this long explanation of Linda concerning her politics and personality if we are not supposed to bring this into consideration in deciding between (c) and (h)?

The polite subject will doubtless try to find some way to interpret the question so that (c) vs. (h) becomes reasonable. One is very simple: the conditional probability of being Alice is higher given the individual is a feminist bank teller than if the individual is just a bank teller. In other words, if you had a pile of pictures of all bank tellers, you would be less likely to pick Alice randomly from the pile than if you were choosing from a pile of all feminist bank tellers (the latter would be almost all females, for one thing).

Now of course other findings of subject ""irrationality"" have different explanations, but few of the experimental findings stand up to scrutiny as serious violations of rationality. Gilboa, nice guy that he is, goes overboard in acceding to the analyses of his critics.

Gilboa also defines rationality in a manner quite at odds with the technical material. He says an individual's choice process is rational if the individual will defend it even after being presented with the evidence that it difference from that predicted/suggested by rational decision theory. This works well with some choices; e.g., if you point out to someone that they lost money by sharing with others in a game, most will respond that of course they knew that, but they prefer to share. However, if some stubborn fool never admits a mistake, he is always rational by Gilboa's criterion. Gilboa goes too far. One can defend social preferences by noting that they satisfy the axioms of decision theory, and thereby maintain a linguistic and philosophical consistency.

Gilboa also presents a few alternatives to traditional rational decision theory, one of which, Prospect Theory, is very important, but does not violate any of the axioms of decision theory provided we define the choice space property (Bounds of Reason, Ch. 12). Most important, he devotes the final chapter to ""case-based"" decision making, which his own (with David Schmeidler) highly successful attempt at broadening rational decision theory.

As for Gilboa's ideas for future research, they are encapsulated in a two-page throw away at the end of the book. In fact, rational decision theory has serious weaknesses that must be addressed by scholars of decision-making. The first is the abject inadequacy of the assumption that individual beliefs can be summarized by a ""subjective prior"" that is given in social isolation. In fact, subjective priors are more aptly designated as ""personal beliefs,"" and personal beliefs are in fact the product of a web/network of social connections and experiences that must be studies sui generis as a central social process. There is currently no such theory at all, although a number of people have suggested the use of network theory as a useful addendum to rational decision theory (e.g., Samuel Bowles and myself in a paper on ""Persistent Parochialism"" in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization several years ago).

A second direction for fundamental change in decision theory is to drop the assumption that individual choice itself is taken in social isolation. When people face radical uncertainty, they often refrain from choosing altogether, and rather consult the social world to ascertain the choices others have made in similar situations. Perhaps ironically, Gilboa and Schmeidler's case-based choice theory provides a perfect analytical starting point for such a theory, though I cannot recall the authors recognizing or advocating this potential extension.

So, the enterprising reader can assimilate this book and start in right away in solving some of the deep problems rational decision theory has set for us.",13
EST,1.0 out of 5 stars,High Efficiency Video Coding: Coding Tools and Specification (Signals and Communication Technology),Hard To Read,"This book is very hard to read for a number of reasons.
It has minor problems. There are spelling mistakes, usually caused by the use of a homonym, such as using ""ore"" instead of ""or"". There are some poor word choices, such as using the very rare ""utile"" instead of ""useful"".
Many sentences are problematic. It might be just a word that doesn't fit. A phrase might be tacked onto a sentence to show a connection with another sentence, but the connection is not clear.
English has a very flexible sentence structure. For long sentences, it is necessary to form a mental model of the sentence structure. While reading the sentence, one might realize that the model doesn't fit. Then, the model has to be revised and the sentence re-read. This happens frequently with this book. In many cases, I couldn't understand a sentence even though I read it several times.
Chapter and section structures are poor. The order I would like is to start with the problem we are trying to solve, follow it with an overview of the solution and then get into progressively finer detail. The author prefers to start with the details and, if we are lucky, he will eventually mention something about the purpose. In some places, I felt that he had started with a so-so explanation and then randomized the sentence order.
Often, explanations are based on things the reader should not be expected to know because they are not dealt with until much later in the book. This happens a few times in the descriptions of slice and picture types. The differences between these types are largely based on which coding options can be used. If those options are not understood, it is hard to see why one would choose a particular picture type.
Reading this book is mentally fatiguing. That reduces one's ability to figure out what the author is trying to say.
I'm not saying the book is totally incomprehensible. There are some sections that are easily understood. Unfortunately, these sections do not deal with anything that are both substantive and of interest to me.",4

The cast of characters is great (like Sun, Macinstosh, MIT, and countless computer science dept at major universities) and their are kernels of insight and wisdom about computer architecture throughout.

Keith Tokash,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World.,"An encyclopedia of knowledge, written for non-tech people","""Anyone who tries to entice you with promises of absolute security or safety is pandering to your fears"" (pg 277).
This whole book is filled with common-sense and not-so-common-sense thinking. I had the opportunity to see Schneier speak at Toorcon 2003 in San Diego and I can tell you this guy not only knows as much as anyone about security, he also talks *like a normal person*. He's not arrogant, he doesn't throw in gratuitous latin terms, he just makes a very clear point with extremely strong logic to back it up.
That's what this book is: a handbook on how to logically sift through all the garbage that's trickling down to us via the US media and our govt. Does the FBI need expanded snooping powers? Not according to Schneier, who backs that up with facts regarding 9-11 that tell us the right govt agencies *had* the info, they just couldn't analyze it all. So giving up a bunch of our privacy for the FBI to get more info doesn't make much sense in combating terrorism.
This is just one example in dozens. You may not even agree (I've met a few FBI people and they ALWAYS say they need more power/info), but reading this book allows you to pull the emotion out of security-based decisions, whether they are about home alarm systems or airport security lines.
For people who aren't familiar with Schneier, he is basically a semi-legend in the information security field for his cryptography, writing and speaking. His last book, ""Secrets & Lies"", broadened the scope of his writing from crypto to general infosec. Now he has broadened his focus even further to include the physical world (beyond the server room). To be honest he doesn't really even bring up computers directly that often, and when he does he usually tells us that they aren't nearly as good at making security decisions as people. Seasoned infosec people won't be surprised by any of the logic or conclusions in this book, but it's still worth a read because Schneier has obviously spent a lot of his brain's cycles thinking about security in general and we can all benefit from his conclusions.
Schneier has won my respect with this book. It proves that not only does he get the security details (the crypto), he gets the ""big picture"", even when the big picture has nothing to do with computing (eg muggings). It is rare to find this in one company, let alone one person.",7
Stephen Northcutt,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World.,Useful tool for executives,"I was pretty excited to read Bruce Schneier's Beyond Fear, I have enjoyed hearning him speak and like his blog. I will say that the book could have said what it says with a lot less pages, possibly even an essay. However, there are lots of great stories and a fantastic word picture called ""Security Theater"". His illustration is that after 9/11 no one knew what to do to combat air terrorism, so they gave the appearance of action by doing things like confiscating nail files. Oh do I agree that much of what we see is security theater!

Bruce has a five step process he tries to illustrate, especially in the second half of the book:

* What assets are you trying to protect?
* What are the risks to these assets? ( I think threats is a more correct word than risks )
* How well does the security solution mitigate those risks?
* What other risks does the security solution cause?
* What trade-offs does the security solution require?

This is a nice implementation of threat vector analysis and he tells great stories. I am not sure the book teaches that much, but it might be a valuable awareness tool for executives.",2
Jas Bro,3.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World.,Rehash indeed,"Having already read ""Secrets and Lies"", I often felt like I had already read this book.
Even if this is your first Schneier, however, I completely agree with other reviewers that there is a lot of padding going on, and the contents of the book could have been presented much more succinctly.
I think quality (as opposed to quantity) of the contents is what's saving this title. The author gives a professional and detached opinion about security in general, focussing often on post-9/11 security countermeasures.
Today (2009) parts of this book are obviously outdated, but sadly, much of its rational analyses are still valid. It's clearly not been a favourite read among post-9/11 politicians.",7
N/A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World.,Finally!

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World.,"Very Good, and Not as Muddled as One has Claimed","This book is very informative, interesting, and entertaining. I've recommended it to people both within and outside the CS and IT communities w/o reservation.

Rather than reiterating things said in the many positive reviews, I'd like to take issue with one reviewer who says Schneier misuses the term ""threat."" In particular, this reviewer says ""A threat is a party with the capabilities and intentions to exploit a vulnerability in an asset."" This definition is both counter to standard English usage and counter to standard usage within the computer security field. Every book on my shelf has roughly the same definition of threat: ""Threat: a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability"" -- Stallings, Network Security Essentials, p. 5. So a threat is condition or event, not a party. The reviewer seems to confuse threat with potential adversary.

Schneier's terminology is the standard terminology, and he uses it correctly.",23
Busy Reader: Get To The Point,1.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World.,Little practical value,"""Beyond Fear"" contains the five-step analysis you see in many of the reviews. This framework is valuable, but Schneier adds little wisdom beyond it. When Schneier applies the five steps to actual security decisions, the results do not inspire confidence. Granted, security is often complicated, and no protection is fail-proof. But these observations alone do nothing to take us ""Beyond Fear,"" in fact they increase fear and paralysis. Overcoming this muddle is the evident challenge in writing about security, a challenge the author runs away from, on every page. Instead, he talks about biology, warfare and dozens of other subjects. These fun facts do nothing to clarify security decisions.

Schneier's rather self-important tone amplifies my disappointment. Example: the book jacket draws us in by asking, ""Will arming pilots make flying safer?"" and hinting that Schneier proves the negative. He doesn't even answer the question! He runs past it about three times in the text, and the closest thing to an answer is roughly, ""maybe, but we ought to think about it first."" Well Duh!

Altogether, this book reminds me of William Gibbs Macadoo's description of the speeches of President Warren Harding: ""An army of pompous phrases marching over the landscape in search of an idea.""

I have worked in the information security field for eleven years. I don't claim authority, just familiarity with the concepts and success in communicating them.",6
John Murphy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Visualizing Data: Exploring and Explaining Data with the Processing Environment,thoughtful and fairly useful,"It's important to remember that this book is not as general as it first appears. The discussions in it can be applied to another environment like Matlab or R, but not the examples. However, it is not merely a Processing tutorial. It does a good job of layout out the stages that one must go through in the process of creating a visualization from a dataset. Fry lays out the basic steps at the beginning, then goes through them repeatedly in a number of very different applications. Following along is relatively easy, though I really wish the author had provided a single URL to go get everything rather than give out URLs piecemeal throughout the book.

I should repeat that this is not merely a Processing tutorial. If it were, it would fall short on a number of counts, including using a number of commands without adequately explaining them, and omitting discussion of things that a Processing programmer is likely to need to know. This is still a good introduction to the language, though (it was my introduction) and offers enough insight into what the language and environment can do without getting too bogged down in the mechanics or design philosophy.",6

how to think about each step of the process from selecting the data through to the final
step of refining the display. There are issues that are not obvious to the graphical
display newbie, and they are brought up, and a good approach given.

On the other hand, if you are a programmer who is already writing sophisticated

In particular the use of java for a whole lot of tasks including text parsing and data mining leads to very tedious and verbose code where a few lines of perl or awk would have done the job.

Unfortunately it would be more appropriate if the title (Visualizing Dta) and sub-title (Exploring and Explaining Data with the Processing Environment) were switched. This book is primarily a tutorial on using the Processing Environment ([...] showing you how to create various interactive charts and composed primarily of code examples.

In addition, the visualizations presented in the book are far from aesthetically pleasing. The Processing Environment has the capability to create visualizations that are not only functional, but beautiful as well. You can find a collection of visualizations at [...] many of which were created with the Processing Environment.

Andrew Otwell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Visualizing Data: Exploring and Explaining Data with the Processing Environment,Outstanding,"This is an exceptionally good book on a specialist topic by one of my design heroes. Where most data visualization books present either pages of (often quite ugly) charts and diagrams, but with no tools to create them, Fry manages here to combine both programming skills and a real understanding of design. It's the rare book that manages to do two disciplines really well. Though it's full of code, Visualizing Data is so much more than a technical manual.

This is definitely a programming book; I agree with another reviewer here that if you're already comfortable with Java you'll find this much easier going. But Fry builds his code examples up sensibly, and explains what's going on. A smart Flash developer or Processing dabbler (like me) really won't have any trouble following along. The examples move from simple plotting of points, to time-based animation, to complex correlation, and into more complex visualizations. And it's not just drawing pixels: there are long and useful sections on data acquisition techniques, approaches to parsing and formatting data. Luckily, Fry's a really good writer, and is able to keep these topics from getting dull.

But the great thing about Visualizing Data is that it's also a *design* book--a real one--with thoughtful considerations about use of color, typography, and the ""feel"" of interaction. Fry's data visualizations are worthy of being in any of Edward Tufte's books. I nearly stood up and cheered when Fry took a few paragraphs in the middle of a code explanation to talk about why the em-dash character and non-lining numerals made the typography of a particular example better. That level of detail is, I think, totally absent from any other book like this.",52
Salvatore R. Mangano,3.0 out of 5 stars,Visualizing Data: Exploring and Explaining Data with the Processing Environment,Mixed feelings,"This book allowed me to quickly create some simple applications using the processing API. So, in that respect, the book was successful. However, the book falls short in three respects.

1) One would expect a book with the title ""Visualizing Data"" to be crammed with pictures showing many different data visualizations. However, this book has relatively few. Every colleague of mine who passed by my desk and picked up the book had the exact same reaction.

2) The processing language is touted as a means for people unfamiliar with programming to get up to speed with visualization. However, I would be very surprised if anyone with little programming experience would get much out of this book.

3) Don't expect to use this book as a reference for the processing language. It is basically just a collection of half explained examples. Consider for example the function smooth(). This function appears in almost every example but forget about trying to find an explanation of what the function does in the book.

The book is probably worth buying to get up to speed quickly but plan on spending a significant amount of time sifting through the processing.org website and other online resources before being able to get anything non-trivial done. And if you don't already know Java then don't expect to accomplish anything even modestly complex without a lot of outside help.",133

The exposition here is based on the Shannon's (not Wiener's) formulation or model of the theory, having been initiated in his breakthrough 1948 paper. I purchased this book more than a couple of years ago as a beginning math grad student mainly interested to (quickly and affordably) learn some basics about the subject, without necessarily intending to specialize in it. The text in my opinion should also be accessible to any engineering student with a one or two semester background in real analysis, and a working knowledge of the theory of probability (also summarized at the beginning of the book). Topics discussed include: noiseless coding, discrete memoryless channels, error correcting codes, information sources, channels with memory, and continuous channels. There are some very illuminating historical notes + remarks, and also problem sets at the end of each chapter, with solutions included at the back of the book, making an ideal setting for self-study. Aside from being a great resource for learning the basics however, one sole setback of the book is that all the results and theorems presented therein date from the 50's and early 60's, so one will have to look elsewhere to find out about some of the more recent developments in the field.",18

So I hard coded the equations and and the simulator worked fine. The trouble came every time I needed to make a change or improvement in the topology.

I bought Dr. Najm's book to see if there were any hints I could pick up to make the job easier. What I discovered was that using the elegantly simple ideas in the book, I could write a general purpose simulator that would run underneath my application that I could change and extend just by changing a SPICE-like netlist.

He introduces the concept of creating modified nodal analysis equations on the fly using element stamps, then introduces non-linear analysis and finally dynamic element analysis. You can work through the chapters quickly and get each concept down by completing the computer project at the end of each chapter.

Dr. Najm was even good enough to reply to an email question I asked him about a convergence problem I was having (which turned out to be a simple programming error.)

My guess is that this project was conceived as a quickie update to the original Information Anxiety to take advantage of Internet mania, and as such much of the work was delegated to others, but without sufficient review and editing. (There are too many editing mistakes to list here, but suffice it to say that probably few books have a misspelling in the Table Of Contents as this one does -- ""Informatgion"" instead of ""Information"".)
RSW tells us that it's important to always start off with what the question is. Problem is, he doesn't follow his own advice in that book. He careens uncontrollably from gushy predictions about the future, to cataclysmic warnings of information deluge, to superficial suggestions on software and web design, to facile pop management advice, The only thread connecting all these disjointed pieces is that he strictly limits himself to talking about how important something or other is, without ever giving specific advice about how to approach it.
I am personally interested in the field of localization and globalization. So naturally I was curious as to what insight RSW brought to this area. What I found was a single, lonely page on the topic, with a few lines of simplistic patter, and a strange, unexplained diagram of various fountain pens with country names associated with each.
I am also interested in the combination of text and graphics to present information and in fact bought this book thinking it might have some insights in that regards. So I was quite happy to see in the Table of Contents a section Design in the Digital Age, summarized as ""In this Digital Age we need to focus on the connections among all design elements: medium, words, pictures, and sound."" Alas, true to form, all the section in question does is repeat that we need to focus on this, with no clue as how we might actually do that, nor a single example in sight. To get an idea of the poor editing quality of this book, consider the following paragraph from this section:
""Where words meet pictures meet sound creates understanding. Are you a value-based organization? A service-based organization? A quality-based organization? Are you all three? We test communication by conveying a message and having the recipient understand it, be interested in it, and remember it. Any other measure is unimportant and invalid."" Does anyone else wonder how the stuff about organizations fits in here? It's just random cut-and-paste content that accidentally found its way here, never to receive the benefit of the editor's pen. Signs of rampant cut-and-pasting abound throughout the book.
Although not really the fault of the author(s), the book is also seriously dated, having come out while there was still some degree of dot-com mania going on (although the peak was passed). So you can read this book on sort of an archaeological level, to recall all the bizarre things people were saying back in those heady days. Internet refrigerators, anyone?
I probably don't need to summarize; let me simply say you are best off spending your time and money on virtually any book on this topic besides this one.",83

As I was reading this book, I wondered if the authors had a specific goal in mind. What segment of the SQL 2012 admin/developers were they targeting?

The book is not for the beginners, but it is not for the advanced user either. If you want to have real deep understanding of SQL 2012 BI, then this book falls short. If you want to most comprehensive, yet shallow coverage, of SQL 2012 BI features, then this might be a worthwhile buy.

Sachmo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Software Requirements 2,3.5 stars... worth reading but reads like a verbose work instruction,"I did not find this book as good as other reviewers seemed to think.

To give a bit of a background, I'm work on a fairly complex robotics system with both hardware and software components. Determining system requirements is one of the major tasks that I perform on a daily basis.

I did find this book useful, as after reading it I had a much better perspective from the 5000 foot level of how requirements affect the entire business organization and product development process. It really drills down the importance of understanding what it is you are trying to build before designing a product. This book is 100% useful to engineers that focus on hardware as well as software - don't be fooled by the title.

My main gripe with the book is that it reads like an overly verbose company work instruction (imagine a dry and somewhat boring employee orientation manual). There are entire pages of material that could have been summed up much better in a paragraph or so, or with an effective picture. Many of the flow charts in the book for example read like your typical overly complex and useless business process charts that no one would ever actually reference when they do their job.

For the record, I don't have a problem with flow-charts, but they need to be simple to be effective, and despite what I stated above, there are a couple flow-chart gems in the book.

On to the specifics...

Section I of the book focuses on a very general overview of requirements, roles that different people perform in relation to requirements (i.e. designers, product managers, project managers, system analyst, testers, etc.). I found most of this material to be useless, except for comparing how my company structured itself versus standard practice across the industry. I imagine that anyone working at a company with any sort of formalized requirements process wouldn't get too much out of this section either.

Section II is a bit better. It begins with a focus on the business aspects of requirements. Without a clear scope document and business vision, the requirements are meaningless. It goes on to argue the importance of customer feedback during the requirements development process. I think some clearer explanation on gathering customer feedback, with specific case studies for how to drill down customer desires into tangible features to incorporate into a product would have gone a long way here... but I generally agree with the philosophy. Much of the use case / customer feedback chapters were too general to be useful though.

Section II also covers good practices in documenting requirements. I took this part for granted because my company has many of these practices already in place, but had I been working for a smaller company or startup, I would have found these organizational tips to be invaluable. This is really great material if you don't have any formalized process in place.

Section III covers a lot of issues related to version control, changing requirements during the development process, maintaining traceable requirements... This section is boring, and could have benefited by being more concise as well. Reading it did give me a better perspective of the requirements process however.

Section IV, a very short section, was really one of the best parts of the book. It ties together the other sections in some of the effective flow charts of the book as to how requirements management is a PROCESS, and one that lies at the heart of good product development. If you've ever been through a project and had a gut feeling that major decisions were being rushed without due consideration, or that the wrong tasks were being prioritized, this section will crystallize how things should have gone in that project. It covered a few things I hadn't seen before, such as measuring requirements volatility, which is a good way to get a handle on how well the product is defined over a long period of time.

Finally in the appendices, there are a couple hidden gems that cover the maturity level of a company, and what level of requirements management are actually NEEDED by company depending on the project. For a simple project, requirement management tools would be major overkill.

Overall a good book for managing requirements. People that work on large, technically challenging projects in large groups / organizations would find this book especially useful. It suffers though from being way too long for the information that it is trying to impart.

My review might a little harsh, as I could see myself re-reading a couple selected parts of this book from time to time, but I simply would never rate this book anything close to 5 stars, and I'm surprised by how high other reviewers have esteemed this book.",2

Parmalee,4.0 out of 5 stars,Software Requirements 2,Enlightening Read for a Requirements Novice Like Me,"When I first purchased this book back in 2006, I went through most of it fairly quickly, and even downloaded some of Wiegers supplementary material from processimpact.com. Some of my colleagues took notice and together we formed a mini-workshop using the downloaded materials, which we used to gather requirements for an enhancement to one of the applications I assist in managing.

A merger and subsequent reorganization later, I found the time to finish the book. I recommend it for the developer or technical manager who finds themselves in a project that lacks thorough requirements development. The book uses appropriate tone and terminology to address its' intended audience; it is neither too simplistic nor overly dense. It has enough supplementary material to preclude the need to build a requirements development process from scratch without looking too much like a cookbook. Its' bibliography includes several classics and many references not familiar to me. All in all, a balanced book about requirements development and management.",1
Chris Kessel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Software Requirements 2,Great practical advice on requirements,"I'm somewhat of a software engineering/process geek. I find the process of creating a product more interesting than the actual code these days (though I like to code). Wiegers' book is THE bible, in my opinion, for eliciting and maintaining requirements.
He covers the issues involved in gathering requirements and keeping them up to date, often offering multiple ways to resolve issues. Wiegers, unlike many academic oriented books, fully acknowledges the political and cultural difficulties that arise when trying to institute a requirements program. Much of his advice is practical and he gives good pointers on the highst ROI practices, so you can inject a little at a time, rather than trying to change culture wholesale.
I'd give a 4.5 out of 5 if I could, due only to the ""Next Steps"" sections at the end of each chapter. The ""Next Steps"" are supposedly be small steps you can take to start using the advice Wiegers offers. Unfortunately, most of the steps start with ""Take a page/chapter from your current requirements document...."" I've worked at few companies that even have a requirements document, so I'm not sure how useful the ""Next Steps"" really are.
But, that complaint aside, this book is the best combination of reference information for techniques and advice on how to use them on the job.",16

2. It is well written, both in content and edition style (format) so it is very easy to read and understand quickly
3. It has references to standards and literacy but it is just to illustrate and not so heavily that makes it hard to read

Jaume Puigbo Vila,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes","Information theory, the third physics revolution of the XXth century","The author has a degree in probability theory and artificial intelligence, but he is a professor of journalism and has therefore written a book which is both very entertaining and not too difficult to understand. The subject is information, which Seife claims is the third XXth century revolution in physics started by Claude Shannon and which has relations with the other two: Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.

Of course, information is also related to thermodynamics and entropy, so the book contains a discussion of all these topics: thermodynamics, relativity and quantum mechanics. Famous conundrums such as Schroedinger's cat, entanglement, Maxwell's demon, etc. are analyzed from the point of view of information theory.

Here are some snippets of the book:

According to Seife, Einstein dictum ""Nothing can travel faster than light"" is really about information:"" Information speed cannot exceed c"". Another interesting fact is that what really causes computers to heat is the erasure of bits.

Seife describes recent achievements and experiments, proof that he is familiar with the latest results. One curious example is the solution of ""the knight problem"" in 2000 by using a DNA computer! Another one is that the entire human race has less genetic diversity than a few scores of chimps due to some kind of cataclysm about 500,000 years ago. A third one is the 1996 experiment demonstrating the existence of virtual particles (the so called Casimir effect).

In chapter 7, quantum computers are introduced and the possibility of the brain being one is briefly discussed. Unfortunately, it seems that Max Tegmark proved Roger Penrose wrong on this count. You begin to understand the power of quantum computation when the author describes Grover's algorithm to guess a number out of 16. Classically you need four yes/no answers to four questions. Grover manages the same task with two. Quantum computation reduces the complexity of some problems from n to square root of n.

I found also very interesting the reasons why the photoelectric effect cannot be explained by waves. On the other hand, interference cannot be explained by a corpuscular theory of light, so we are stuck with duality.

Towards the end, the author discusses black holes and the holographic principle: the quantity of information contained in a ball is not limited by its volume (surprisingly), but by its area. Since most cosmologists consider now the universe infinite (inflation seems to imply this) we are led, via the holographic bound, to the conclusion that the universe contains infinite copies of our own bubble universe. Seife admits that this is the most bizarre thing among the many ones described in his book.",7
Elton Hall,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes",Information and Understanding the Universe,"Information is the key to the mysteries of the universe, according to Charles Seife, author of Zero and now of Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes (Penguin Books, 2006, ii + 296 pp.). This information is not like the letters on a page (which encode information that allows us to read words), though it includes that. It also includes any kind of charge or registered change of state, such as a 0 or 1 in computer talk. In fact, anything that can be represented by 0's and 1's is information, and all information can be so registered. In explaining how information theory has transformed thinking in the sciences, Seife covers a lot of ground--cosmology, quantum theory, biology, etc., etc.

Seife does a fine job of explaining some key concepts in information theory, such as redundancy--the use of clues to indicate what some piece of information actually is. One such is the use of vowels even when not needed for capturing the words. Th ct n th ht, probably does not need the vowels to be understood. `Ingenius' and `ingenuous' would, however. One thing I did not know, meaning I was utterly clueless about, is that computers, which use compressed files that eliminate all sorts of redundancy, do make errors, though we virtually never see them because there are built-in checks and balances that catch and correct them. Since a computer operates entirely on 0's and 1's, or, more literally, on charges and lack of charges, all information that we normally think of as information can be recorded in this way.

What Seife wishes to show is that information theory underlies physics and other sciences and that understanding that much helps to deal with a variety of problems, from probabilities to the famous Schrödinger's cat to black holes and what happens around them. He also discusses some problems that have yet to be resolved. Without attempting to explain his explanations, which make sense upon reading but can be difficult to keep clearly in mind, he uses as examples DNA sequences, mathematical formulas for the expansion of gases (which exactly parallel equations for the transmission of information!), and probabilities associated with questions like the state of Schrödinger's cat before anyone looks. He illuminates the issue of light functioning as a wave and as particles through information theory, showing that, while light might be considered neither or both, thought of as information resolves the paradoxes associated with it.

The book, as he warns, has a dreary side, since information is closely tied to entropy, the diffusion of energy until it is evenly distributed throughout the universe. Information theory itself suggests that we are doomed to a future (incomprehensibly long in the future) when all information disappears, that is, entropy is total. For information requires differences in energy levels--a distinction between 0 and 1, so to speak--to exist, and, for Seife, everything is information. The time will come when there will be no such differences. There are more immediate threats to our existence, however.",5

Camber,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes","Muddy Thinking, Fuzzy Writing","Count me with the other reviewers who gave this book 2 stars. I think their criticisms are generally on target, and the book is lacking on pretty much every level.

First of all, the book lacks clarity, with few of the concepts and arguments explained clearly. Part of the problem may be the avoidance of math, as is common in popular science books. However, as I labored to get through the book, my impression grew ever stronger that Seife actually doesn't understand the subject matter well enough himself, so the fuzziness seems to stem mainly from that. It's as though he has learned his science primarily from popular science books, rather than taking the time to learn the material rigorously. This subject evidently needs a serious scientist, not a journalist who happens to be interested in science.

Tied to this, I didn't care for Seife's writing style. As other reviewers noted, his writing has the quality of trying to oversell the ideas, and relies too much on silly metaphors, as though that could somehow substitute for clarity.

The book also largely lacks a necessary philosophical dimension. The concept of energy is quite abstract and underlies all of natural science (energy isn't tangible material ""stuff"" you can hold in your hand, but is rather more like a general capacity to cause change), and Seife doesn't seem to realize this. But then he goes further and asserts that information, which is even more abstract than energy, is ""physical,"" yet he offers no real discussion of how to interpret that claim. Instead, he just forces the information idea on many areas of science (thermodynamics, quantum theory, biology, cosmology, etc.), as though asserting a bunch of relatively vague connections is a substitute for clear definitions and careful scientific reasoning.

Having said all of this, let me note that I actually do think that the thesis regarding the fundamental role of information is plausible, perhaps even probable -- Seife writes as though he came up with the idea, even though it's by no means original to him. The problem is simply that Seife proves unable to properly explore this thesis, and he certainly fails to adequately make the case for it in this book.

With this book having turned out a bust, despite the thesis being plausible, the question is what to try next. I know of two other popular books on this subject, Information: The New Language of Science by Hans Christian von Baeyer and The Bit and the Pendulum: From Quantum Computing to M Theory-The New Physics of Information by Tom Siegfried, but the reviews for these books raise the concern that they might not be much better than Seife's book. Another book, apparently written at a much higher level and published by Springer Verlag, is Information and Its Role in Nature (The Frontiers Collection) by Juan Roederer, and I think that one looks more promising.

But getting back to Seife's book, I'd recommend skipping it entirely. I found it to be an insult to the reader's intelligence, and a waste of the reader's time. My time has already been wasted, but yours doesn't have to be also ...",16

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes","Well written, but only for the true layperson","This is a gentle introduction to a fascinating subject: that information actually has a physical basis in the universe and that information theory (based on the work of Shannon to determine how much information can theoretically be transmitted across phone lines, but carried by Shannon and his successors far, far further)may actually be fundamental in explaining quantum mechanics and indeed our entire universe.

The book starts with basic description of entropy and definitions of information and proceeds to discussions of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and such interesting topics as whether Black Holes destroy information or not (Hawkings bet they did, but ultimately conceded...as Seife notes, Hawkings may be the only one who actually changed his mind).

Seife is a clear writer and great at creating an argument step-by-step.

However... I was a math major, a physics minor and am a working computer scientist with years of coursework in automata and complexity theory. Though there was new material in this book for me, vast swathes were way too introductory for me. I really didn't need a 20 page description of how bits are the fundamental element of information and strings of bits can encode anything, or for that matter to rehash special relativity or the selfish gene theory. Though it mostly succeeds, this book may be a little too ambitious. It tries to start with first principles for the layman, but spans so many fields (thermodynamics, information theory, quantum mechanics, biology, cosmology, special and general relativity) that providing basic introductions to all of them greatly dilutes the new and interesting material.

However, it dares to claim that information is the ultimate theory that explains it all, failing short of convincing the reader that that is the case. There are plenty of exaggerated statements about how ""information"" explains everything, that energy is the same as information, etc., all of them based on very week connections and evidence. As many other authors, this one confuses theory of information, with Shannon's theory of efficient message coding. The author also keeps confused with the role of the observer in the information processes, sometimes requiring it/him/her, sometimes dismissing it/him/her as unnecessary.",3
David J. Kreiter,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes",Information is physical,"Charles Seife has not been the first to proclaim that the most fundamental entity in the universe is ""information"". Physicist John Wheeler, David Bohm, and Tom Siegfried among others have held this view as well, but no other author I've read has gone to such lengths to establish this idea as an undeniable conclusion.

In a consise staight-forward format, Siefe delves into biology, computer science, cosmology, Relativity, and quantum theory, to establish the notion that information and the second law of thermodynamics are intricately linked. And he does this without ever allowing the reader to become lost or confused.

Information is always physical, whether it is marks on paper, holes in a punch card, atoms in an electo-magnetic state on a CD, photon polarization, or up/down spin on an electron. All information has a physical representation. And like any physical thing in our universe, it abides by the laws of nature, including the laws of thermodynamics and Relativity. Information, like energy, can neither be created nor destroyed. Infomation always moves toward the most probable state: maximum entropy. And no information can travel faster than the speed of light.

The qubit, which is the quantum representation of the classical bit, abides by the laws of quantum physics, and despite the weird instantaneous quantum connection between particles in an entangled state demonstrated by Bell's theorem of inequality; the qubit does not violate faster-than-light communication. Oddly, the qubit does violate one tenant of Relativity--that no effect can precede its cause. It seems that the time-asymetrical qubit has no ""before"" or ""after"".

Unlike the classical bit wich resides in a binary, either/or state, the qubit can be in a superposition of states: Two states simultaneously. This fact is what makes the possibility of quantum computing so enticing. By nesting probable outcomes in a superposition of states many fewer yes/no questions are needed in algorithms, making quantum computing many orders of magnitude faster than classical computing.

But, far wider implications exist for the quantum qubit. Siefe believes that the qubit's superposition of states solves two contentious vagaries of the Copenhagen Interpretation of reality: What constitutes an observer? And is there a difference between the classical and quantum worlds?

Siefe says that there is no clear-cut demarcation between the subatomic and classical world, and there is no conscious observer required to collapse the wave function. This directly leads to a resolution of the famous Schrodinger's cat paradox. Since the universe at large is constantly involved in probing with light waves, neutrinos, and zero point energy, the universe itself acts as the observer. Large macro objects such as cats undergo decoherence (a collapse of the superposition of states into a classical bit) very rapidly, while a single subatomic particle or photon take a much longer time, being less likely to come into contact with nature's measurements.

Information is so fundamental that Siefe believes Richard Dawkins popular book called ""The Selfish Gene"", would have been more appropriately titled ""Selfish Information"". Siefe says that when it comes to biological organisms, information is even more selfish than the gene, and can run contrary to survival of the fittest. He cites several examples of information reproducing itself even though it is detrimental to the organism, and at times, to the entire species. Information will attempt to replicate even at the expense of the proliferation of the organism carrying the information.

This book was very enticing, and left me with some questions. Is it information that is the most basic entity, or is it ""meaning"" as physicist David Bohm maintains? Is there a difference between information and meaning? Experiments with polarization of light lead me to suspect that there is a difference.

And, finally, is the brain really a classical machine as Siefe says, or is it a quantum machine as Evan Harris Walker maintains? (See my review: ""The Physics of Consciousness"" on Amazon). Either way, Charles Seife is right on the mark with this work. I give this book 4.5 stars for being an excellent and fun read.

This book does neither .It reads as if the author dictated extemporaneously into a voice recorder and didn't even bother to edit it . And it needs a lot of editing and deletions to be informative and worth spending the time to read.
It is rambling and does not open up the wonders of science to the reader.

Stanley B. Klein,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes",Not good,"Bad idea and bad presentation. I read the ""zero"" book (essentially a history) and was poised to have another interesting popularization of a key construct (information).

What I find, instead, is stipulation, assertion, failure to address (much less recognize -- best I can tell from what is written) weighty issues that continue to blur the lines between epistemology and ontology, and a smattering of formalization and empirical demonstration. And, as best I can tell, these sit in superposition with no discernible (or conceptually satisfying) arrangement even after the wave collapses.

The author, if he truly wants to elucidate (assuming he can) would better serve the intelligent public by dwelling on the implications of one (or a very few) highly debatable issues -- e.g., ""information is physical"" (or perhaps ""perception is reality""; btw is this idealism?) and trying to show in a logically compelling way why these stipulations have any rational traction. Instead, we get bits (no pun here) of ideas that beg (and question beg) for considered treatment absent any serious attempt to logically sanction the ideas presented.

What a mess.

An aside -- this short book would be shorter still if the author did not have the tendency to repeat himself (often in adjacent sentences).

Also, the device ""X, Y, Z...and even N"", where we start off with something remote physically or conceptually (e.g., X = atom, quark, etc.) and end with something silly (e.g., N = cats, pintos, piles of poop) is a sophomoric device used once. The author uses it with sad frequency.

Finally, as per style, announcing that ""this is really ""troubling"", weird"", ""upsetting"" every few paragraphs is, well, troubling in and of itself.

This is not a good effort, even for the pop science audience.",1
tacfire,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes",Great Read...!,"Great Book, But...!

Quantum mechanics made fun and easy! I guess all those ""Physics for Dummies,"" books paid off `cause Seife really makes it all understandable!

However...! I was thoroughly vexed by Seife painfully contradicting himself regarding the first law of thermodynamics and the Big Bang.

Page 31, after stating very clearly that energy cannot be created or destroyed, he footnotes (4) ...""But all the energy (including Einstein's mass-energy) currently in our universe was created with the big bang, and that amount hasn't changed since the universe's birth.""

Note the ""was created,"" in the passive voice.

So, if mass-energy can't be created or destroyed, how ""was"" it created and by whom/what?

All through his book ""Zero,"" Seife seems to deride the West for avoiding zero out of fear of nothingness, the void, infinity-G-d. That fear strangled mathematical and scientific advancements for a millennium. Yet here he makes an assertion with the similar fear-induced tone.

Here's the brutal heresy that Seife dares not state:

Why is there ""something"" rather than ""nothing?""

Perhaps because ""nothing"" is a concept with no physical reality. Perhaps because the amount of mass and energy are the ""entropic reality"" for our universe.

By simply applying the First Law of Thermodynamics that states that matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed, our universe has always existed in some form, with the exact same amount of energy and matter. The Big Bang explains our universe's current viewable configuration.

Sadly, Seife dares not state this obvious axiom, perhaps fearing that he is entering the No G-d domain!

Look in mirror wild-man! It isn't just the ""Dark Ages"" Europeans that feared knowledge!

Other than that..READ THIS BOOK!!!",22
Lorne Bailey,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,Good Book for Understanding Challenges of Designing User Friendly Technologies,"While I agree with many things Alan Cooper says about the challenges of designing user friendly technologies for normal end users, I think his attitude is a bit pessimistic about how engineers and programmers design technologies that are yet to come... I think it is better to encourage Universities and Colleges to require a certain amount of technical support and customer support courses in additional to standard social sciences courses required for a typical science major for Engineering and computer science students to graduate... This should also be required for any student who hopes to get into any field of study where work in this field would affect end users of products and services rendered to them. Engineers and Technical workers need to take responsibility for their work and help end users with their products. Furthermore, licensing for Engineers and Technical workers should not only require ability to design products and technologies (i.e. traditional assessment materials), but also require ability to communicate effectively with end users and support their products and technologies. This might be a great book for young students in high school and college who want to study Engineering, IT Services, Computer Sciences or related fields.",1
V. Shah,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,"Read it for the smart stuff, but ignore the stupid stuff","The author has a lot of important things to say about the importance of design in software, and the many ways in which good design is sabotaged by management, programmers, deadlines, conventional thinking, tradition, lethargy, and sloth. Fighting these influences to achieve excellently designed products is incredibly important, and incredibly difficult, and the author makes this case well.

Where he goes totally off the rails is when he attacks stereotypes instead of people. He claims that every programmer thinks that he is different and can cross between coding and interaction design -- but none of them can. It turns out that he means that he was the first, and the last, one to be able to do so, because he is God. He claims that graphic designers are there to pretty up an interaction designers designs -- while ignoring the true amount of collaboration that has to be achieved between graphic design, interaction design, and programming to achieve any excellent software. His solution to bad design is to listen to nobody but the designer. (He never mentions the possibility of a subpar interaction designer.)

Finally he spends a lot of time attacking various management structures that are found at Microsoft and companies who mimic Microsoft. Well, I have worked in the NYC tech scene for 20+ years, and nobody here gives a damn about Microsoft's management practices. In the years since the book came out, it has turned out that nobody anywhere cares about Microsoft management practices anymore. It just felt like another rant about something that is relevant to nobody.

But if you wade through the extremist ranting, there really are useful messages and examples throughout the book. It's worth reading if you're in the business of making software.",1

More importantly, it shows where their contribution should ideally be, in the overall project timeline (hint: not at the beginning, where they are too often placed!).

I bought this book because I was researching persona development, and there's a good chapter or two about that in there, but that part isn't very in-depth. However, the rest of the book was so interesting that I read it all pretty quickly anyway.",1
Sage Gerard,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,"The Good, the Bad, and the Clueless","I am a developer of seven years with solid experience in both front-end design and back-end code slapping. I also have a portfolio of visuals I designed to spread messages. My projects include a litigation cost estimator (used by a mediation attorney to quickly lay out the probable costs of a case), an inventory management system for a non-profit, campaign signs and buttons for Matthew Moore for the 2012 General Election, and promotional graphics for a 3D printer hackathon hosted in a makerspace. I know how things work under the hood, and I can make the complicated simple.

That said, I did not hate this book, but the practical zen of Steve Krug dances circles around Cooper's frustrated vision for a hierarchy where developers are ""put in their place."" Cooper opens with a brilliantly articulated view into the world of miserable user experience, where the models and procedures of dumb programs leak into the realm of interaction design, where things should make sense. He cites meaningful, real world examples ranging from common frustrations with everyday technologies (like ATMs), to life-or-death scenarios involving callous airplane navigation systems.

Somewhere along the line, Cooper switches gears from talking about the problems of software to talking about the problems of people. This is a logical step, but Cooper proceeds to advocate a strict hierarchy where programmers are isolated from the big picture because they, frankly, think like computers and are therefore potentially hazardous to users.

This would make sense if we lived in a world where you can assume all black people are lazy because you saw one sleeping in a hammock. Cooper's generalizations stretch to the point where he claims a developer cannot be a good designer because of the way they think. Speaking as both a designer and developer, Cooper is simply wrong about this.

What makes Cooper's book forgettable is that he is not advocating for better technology through educating the public. Rather, he is advocating better technology by pushing social roles onto people with preconceived overgeneralizations of how people think. Cooper would say to you ""You are the kind of person that should... [BLANK]""

The title of my review sums up the categories of people Cooper makes up. Interaction designers and business people are good because they care about the end users, who are clueless to what the bad ol' developers are trying to do to them. While Cooper's dream for better products is noble and just, he feels that the ends justify the means.

The problems in Cooper's book are not products of developers running the world (as he insinuates), it's about communication. Managing developers and communicating user needs to different departments is a difficult, context-centric task with no set formula.

But Cooper offers a formula for how people should behave, and that is why I can't take him seriously.",4

They do it for the sport. It isn't about making it easier. It is about tackling a HARD problem. I've chuckled to myself at work several times when I see this happening now.
Another of my favorite points he makes is about how we never give our users instant satisfaction. They have to invest a great deal into using our products. This locks out so many people and is unnecessary most of the time.
Now, just as a caution, I know many folks that will be offended by Alan's tone at times. Read this for its many great points; ignore what sometimes tends towards fanaticism -- he's just passionate about his topic.",3
Lauren Holmes,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,Careful; this book will change the way you view your world,"After years of watching smart people feel stupid while struggling with computers, I knew there had to be a better way. There is. This book helped to launch me on my career as an interaction designer/interface developer/usability specialist. (No one seems to have adequately captured a title for this position yet.) Cooper spends the first half of the book waking us up to the problem, and the second half showing us what can be done about it.
After using his methodology on a number of projects over the past few years, I can say with all confidence -- IT WORKS. Beautifully. Using Cooper's approach, we've created software applications that don't require training, that users love, that users have even demanded to use rather than their old tools. And the majority of the programmers with whom I've worked have become converts to this process. Many are finally relieved to stop worrying about business requirements and users and interfaces, and are all too pleased to leave those demands in the hands of an interaction designer.
I've primarily used his methodology in an XP programming environment, for those of you who are wondering if the two approaches are compatible. They are, wonderfully, with a few tweaks. But maybe that's another book.",2
pilgrimsprogproj,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,The point was lost somewhere,"I like Alan Cooper. He is entertaining, thoughtful and has numerous amusing anecdotes and analogies. He is a ""voice sounding in the wilderness"" in the software community about usability. Unfortunately, I think his point is lost somewhat in the marketing message and sensationalism of this book. Who is the book written for - the software developer or the frustrated user? The first chapter sounds like a Luddite rebellion against computers. It is hard to imagine the person writing that chapter as a computer professional. Using the analogy of a secretary who doesn't know how to save files to a folder as an example of poor design is blaming the programmer for poor training. True, software is often developed by programmers who barely get real requirements, develop in a vacuum and then force feed the end result to the user. And ironically, Alan Cooper invented Visual Basic, which ushered in Rapid Application Development (RAD) programming (good!) but adds the tendency for quick prototype demos to get shipped as ""Version 1.0"" because the CEO or CIO says,""hey it works now"" (bad!).
These shortcomings are not solved by adding a layer of another design person partially disconnected from the user, or making the screen prettier. It is by adapting the Extreme Programming/Agile programming methods of including the user in everything from design to testing, so the software reflects how the user does business.
I still liked the book, just not clear on the message.",5
R. Kelly Wagner,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,one of the funniest books I've read in ages,"Cooper explains that he hates VB; it was meant to be a makeshift until someone could do the job right, but no one ever did- they used the kludge instead! He procedes to skewer most of modern-day software design, quite deservedly in my opinion. I spend a certain amount of my time telling my students that ""In Excel, the format category Accounting refers to currency symbols, and the format category Currency refers to accounting conventions,"" and ""The phrase Range_Lookup means 'do you want an exact match?' and if the answer is Yes, you have to type in FALSE."" So I am quite alert to how little attention programmers pay to the end users of software. I wish all programmers would read this book! For the rest of us- the end users, the teachers, the people who have to mediate between computers and the not-yet-computer-literate, this book is a great way to at least laugh about it, and to reassure yourselves that it's NOT YOUR FAULT that software seems so illogical!",6

Maxim Masiutin,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,How To Restore The Sanity,"The high-tech industry has inadvertently put programmers and engineers in charge, so their hard-to-use engineering culture dominates. In our rush to accept the many benefits of the silicon chip, we have abdicated our responsibilities. We have let the inmates run the asylum. When the inmates run the asylum, it is hard for them to see clearly the nature of the problems that bedevil them. When you look in the mirror, it is all too easy to single out your best features and overlook the warts. When the creators of the software-based products examine their handiwork, they overlook how bad it is. Instead they see its awesome power and flexibility. Programming is such a difficult and absorbing task, that it dominates all other considerations, including the concerns of the users. Programmers aren't evil. They work hard to make their software easy to use. Unfortunately, their frame of reference is themselves, so they only make it easy to use for other software engineers, not for normal human beings. Why high tech products drive us crazy and how to restore the sanity? This is what this book is about.

Because it is far cheaper for manufacturers to use computers to control the internal functioning of devices than it is to use older, mechanical methods, it is economically inevitable that computers will insinuate themselves into every product and service in our lives. This means that the behaviour of all of our products will soon be the same as most obnoxious computers, unless we try something different. The incredible power of computers means that few people can afford to ignore them. Even if you don't have a desktop computer, you probably own a VCR and an ATM card, which are software-based products. It is unrealistic to simply say you ""won't use computers"". They aren't just getting cheaper; they are getting ridiculously cheaper, to the point of ubiquity and disposability. Many familiar products that we imagine as mechanical (or electronic) are no longer made without computers. Cars, washing machines, televisions, vacuum cleaners, thermostats and elevators are all good examples.

This book is written with humour, liveliness, and amusement, it has a lot of funny illustrations. Yet it reveals the problems of software industry which were left attention for decades. One of the problem is ""elastic user"", such a user which must bend and stretch and adapt to the needs of the moment. When a company speaks about the software it develops, every party involved (management, programmers, testers, sales) include different meaning into the word ""user"". In ""Goal-Directed design"", the participants never refer to ""the user"". Instead, they refer to a very specific individual: ""a persona"". To create a product that must satisfy a broad audience of users, logic will tell you to make it as broad in its functionality as possible to accommodate the most people. Logic is wrong. You will have far greater success by designing for one single person. Imagine that you were designing an automobile to please a wide spectrum of people. You could easily identify at least three subgroups: the soccer mom, the carpenter, and the junior executive. Mom wants a safe, stable vehicle with lots of space and big doors for hauling the kids, dogs, groceries and other stuff. The carpenter wants a rugged vehicle with all-wheel drive and abundant room for ladders, lumber, bags of cement, and tools. The young executive wants a sporty car with a powerful engine, stiff suspension, convertible top and only enough room for too. If we make such a combination vehicle, what a goofy, impossible car will appear! Making three different products in software is lot easier than making them in steel, too. Another problem which the author points to is ""the customer-driven death spiral"", where ""conceptual integrity"" is the only solution.

The author declares that the key to solving the problems is interaction design, and exposes the Goal-Directed design method that provides manufacturers of high tech products with an insightful understanding of their users and a practical blueprint for a superior result. Alan Cooper, the author of the book, and his company, have designed a wide range of products ranging from clean, simple kiosk systems to complex scientific applications, controls for consumer-oriented computer peripherals, conceptual designs for entire product lines, eCommerce sites. The list of companies that adopted the Goal-Directed design includes many industry leaders, large and small, such as 3M, Proctor & Gamble, Dolby Labs, Fujitsu, HP, Informatica, Logitech, SAP, Charles Schwab, St. Jude Medical, and Varian. The description of Goal-Directed design in this book is very reader-friendly and is targeted to the broad audience. Alan Cooper gives the further explanation of this method in his following book ""About Face 2.0"", aimed mostly to the engineers. Although these two books are still not enough to deploy this method in your organisation, they show how vital this technique is for a successful product.",7
Benjamin Pirih,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,No Cognitive Friction Here..,"Alan Cooper gives the reader insight into why so many of today's technological products frustrate and confuse users.

This book has changed the way I will develop products and should be a must read for product managers of application developers. Just learning Mr. Cooper's vocabulary is worth the read. The ideas such as personas, keywords, and designing for an individual push the book way above average. This is an easy read that should be done in your spare time if you want to avoid cognitive friction with your users. It has changed the way I view technology and brought a new awareness to thoughtless technology implementation which often cause failure or misuse.

John,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,Mediocre Book: Buy Only if you Need It,"I was required to purchase this book for a technical writing class at my university. I consider this book to be below average quality. This is not something I would recommend for leisure reading for even reading for personal enjoyment.

The book's wording is very confusing, awkward, and difficult to understand. An example is on page 21, ""The entire software-creation process includes design, all the way from selecting the programming language to choosing the color of the delivery truck."" This awkward wording is repeated throughout the book and makes understanding the author's points more difficult than it needs to be.

This book has some rare gems of insight. One example was the description of what the computer industry considers ""naive"" or ""non computer literate users"". These users often come from low socioeconomic class or poverty. As many people in these classes are ethnic and racial minorities, there is an argument that current programming practices were discriminatory toward minorities. It was something that never occurred to me, and I will keep it in mind.

If you are in the computer industry yourself and are a programmer, like I am, Cooper's assumptions on the indifference of programmers to cater to the common user are absolutely infuriating. Cooper immediately crops all programmers into the same uncaring, snotty-nosed pile. The first thing I learned in a programming class was to make our programs accessible and useful. I care about my program being efficient and intelligent. In my experience, when these features are missing in software, it is due to management saying ""it is good enough already"" and not wanting to pay programmers for the extra time to add these features in.

These assumptions decrease the value, insight, and substance of the book. This book is catered to the bubble he was exposed to as a programmer. Programmers from different types of backgrounds will realize this.",1

Pete,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,should be required reading for programmers,"I've been a programmer for over 25 years, and I think programmers (including me) should read more books like this. Too often, we're driven by our knowledge of what we can do with our languages, data structures, libraries, frameworks, dialog boxes, fonts, colors, etc. We write what's immediately doable given the tools, and lose sight of what would be most desireable. The results are often useful, but unintuitive, inelegant and painful to use. This is why people complain so much about the interfaces of computers, cell phones, PDAs, VCRs, cars, planes, themostats etc.

Alan Cooper argues that the cause of the problem is the culture that creates the products. Programmers are designing today's user interfaces. They naturally design interfaces that they like, so the interfaces are too technical. Cooper suggests a psychological basis for the underlying problem: programmers tend to be interverts that like complexity, so they like complex interfaces. Most programmers are predisposed to expect the human to adjust to the interface. Humans that can't or won't are considered stupid, so they don't really matter. This is many computer interfaces make us feel stupid. Ew're part of the problem, because when an interface fails, we often blame ourselves.

Cooper goes on to describe how to address the problem. One strategy resonated with me: instead of allowing programmers to think in terms of ""the user"", make them think in terms of several specific, defined, named ""personas"". This encourages programmers to imagine real interaction between users and an interface, which improves the thinking about the little details that distinguish a useable, boring, frustrating interface from a pleasant, intuitive, helpful interface.

Af course, Alan Cooper does a much better job describing this than I have. I recommend this book highly.",4
Brian Curtis,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,"Great Ideas, Not Always Well Presented","The culture of software development is changing, but grudgingly. The short-sighted notion ""It's better to be first with something bad than second with something perfect"" has been discredited after too long a reign as the New Paradigm of the Information Age (""It's brilliant because it's counter-intuitive!""), and instead has been exposed for what it is: bad business and a lousy way to treat customers. Alan Cooper's book helps make sense of things as software developers, after decades of coding for each other, are forced to begin acknowledging the cold and strange outside world of Real Life Users.
Cooper's writing is generally clear and easy to follow. He documents his points well and uses numerous true-to-life examples to illustrate the concepts. The ATM analysis, for example, is both effective and memorabl: Why DOES the ATM list account types you don't have, permitting an invalid selection? Why can't you return to a previous screen to correct mistakes, instead of starting over from scratch? Why doesn't the system give you an error message that helps you understand the problem, rather than ""Unable to complete transaction""? No one even bothers to ask these questions, Cooper points out, because we've accepted the default structure of ATM screens--which were created for the convenience of coders and system engineers, rather than users.
Cooper also performs a valuable service in demolishing that old standby programmers' excuse: ""We don't call any of the shots-it's all management's fault!"" Bull. Half the managers in the computer industry are former coders themselves (and laboring under an outmoded and faulty mental model of how software development must occur, by the way). The other half are so non-technical that they're at the mercy of the coders, who are free to decide which features are most important, which will take too long, and ultimately, which will or won't make the cut for the next release. Coders ARE driving this bus, if occasionally from the back seat, and they need to take responsibility for what they produce-and be humble enough to admit that an indispensable part of the development process (interface/interaction design) is beyond their abilities.
That said, Cooper's writing style itself is less than perfect. He presents many compelling case histories, but at times he seems to lean too heavily on insider stories, as if showing off his contacts and expertise in the industry. And, of course, Cooper is far too much in love with his ""dancing bear"" metaphor; long before you've reached the halfway point, you'll be muttering, ""One page...just ONE page without a `dancing bearware' reference, PLEASE! That's all I ask!""
But the messages and lessons in this book are too important to ignore. As Cooper tries to remind us, it is everyday users-not the power users, not even the ""computer literate""-who are the core audience. They're the ones you have to design for: a successful interaction design, rather than a burgeoning list of clever features, is what will determine your product's success or failure.",46
Steamer John,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,this book changed my life,"I was a well-paid systems administrator/help desk guy until I read this book. This book really did inspire me to change careers!

The book basically outlines why engineers (and people who think like engineers) are INCAPABLE of designing effective interfaces. It delves into specifics and supplies some great examples.

I am amused by some of the reviewers here who display the same sort of arrogant contempt that the book outlines. OF COURSE programming a VCR is easy for YOU--you're a person with an ""engineer mind"". My mom can't program a VCR at all, and that's not because she didn't try hard enough or read the instructions. She can't use it because everything about it's interface is counter-intuitive to someone who does not understand machine/code logic.

Just because it's easy for you doesn't mean it doesn't stink. Just because it makes sense to you doesn't mean it can't be made better--to work intuitively for ""regular"" people. Buy this book. Read it. Demand more from your products. It's time to end the insanity.",12
Hoby,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,Excellent insight into the minds of coders,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. It has a wonderful mix of humor, information and just good book structure. It is a must read for everyone that is, works with programmers, or uses the final products of programmers. Essentially, anyone who could be reading this review.

Where some UI authors drone on about why everything is bad and they're so smart but give little proof of that, Cooper makes you laugh at what is wrong and then offers multiple solutions to the problems. It's entertaining and refreshingly current without throwing out the past, bloating his ego or boring you with page after page of going-to-get-to-my-point-any-second-now writing. His insights into the various situations that plague the computer industry are quite good and his solutions are sound. It's high time companies start re-structuring, since bad program design is getting into nearly everything that is controlled with electricity.

Other good things about the book are the care at which the sections are thought out and the brevity of each section. In most chapters he knows when to shut up and get on to the next point. And the next point is most often a nice progression from the previous, and so on. The flow is very good and the points are well made.

It isn't without its troubles but when for instance he repeats himself, it isn't as bad as many authors.. It is often to recap, reference back, say just in case the reader has not read the previous telling, or for the effect of restating so obviously.

Also for me personally, it made me realize some of the things that I've done in my work are better practices than I'd thought.. and things that I've felt iffy about are confirmed bad by his experience and opinion. Altogether, helpful.",6
Craig Cecil,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,"Groundbreaking, paradigm shifting book","Every once in a while you'll read a book or part of a book that completely shifts your thinking. This is one of those books. Alan Cooper (father of Visual Basic) presents for us a litany of horrific examples of interface design, and lays out the case for why spending time and money up front on usability and interaction design will produce the greatest returns of all the steps in software development. But the paradigm shift occurs in Chapters 9 and 10, ""Designing for Pleasure"", ""Designing for Power"", where Cooper hits home the power of the user-centered design process and illustrates the inherent mistakes which almost all software developers make during development. Here's a hint: if you start with requirements specifications, you're already screwed.",10

The title, ""The Inmates Are Running the Asylum : Why High Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How To Restore The Sanity"" is catchy, and as a recent study found, 25% of computer users actually attacked their computers. There is plenty of bad design, and frustration to go around. The opportunity exists for somebody to write a really insightful book identifying the problems and potential solutions to this dilemma. The author COULD have done it.
The author makes some headway in pursuit of this goal, and does in fact present a few innovative approaches and solutions to fixing and preventing problems associated with the design process of technology products and software. These nuggets of gold, are littered few and far between the relentless attack on programmers and engineers.
We are desperately in need of a change in the focus and design of software and other technologically enhanced products.

Cooper has the idea. If you want to design for ""normal"" people, you need to put yourself in their shoes. In this bible of high-tech product design, Cooper gives you tools that helps you design products for your target customers. This isn't just a bunch of recipes for GUIs and wizards, but a way to think about how people actually use your tools.

Atle Brandt,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,Do you see a light or the light?,"It takes a lot of nerve to be the man behind Visual Basic and still claim to know how to ""fix"" computer programming (what virus threat?)

Inmates is a funny book to read (as the title indicates), but it is also likely to offend a few people (as seen by the mixed reviews). It is NOT a ""how to do things differently"" book - but a WHY should we do things differently book. As such it is naturally biased for his point of view: computers are popping up more and more places, becoming faster and faster, yet it still takes the average person more time to do his tasks.

This book is not the only way to improve your products, Extreme Programming is another ""mindset"" that brings a new approach to involving users and their need in the development. It is still a useful input, if management is unable/unwilling to understand that TTT (things take time) - and should be planned accordingly.

The main take-away: have the guts to think, plan and design BEFORE someone starts building (as one quoted programmer says: Hey, you don't want to control me - you want to give me a huge and interesting challenge!!!)",3
Keith C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,There are many better written books on the subject,Cooper is condescending and egotistical.

Alex Stockdale,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,Worth the time and money,"Cooper has done a good job of pointing out common problems in software design. The book is well written, with interesting examples and anecdotes to illustrate the author's points. While most of the book focuses on ""off the shelf"" products, I think the author's arguments are even more relevant to custom software development. If you already believe that software is poorly designed, this book is unlikely to be a revalation to you. It will, however, give you some ammunition to use in discussions with ""apologists"".
I agree with the earlier reviewer, who said that the people most needing to read it probably won't. This would seem to be a great book for development managers and purchasers of software, but I think the only people likely to read the whole thing are professional developers.
I have two criticisms of the book (for which I give it 4 out of 5 stars): too often it comes across as an advertisement for the author's company; and I would have appreciated more ""how-to"" information. To this latter point, the author himself says in his preface that he had intended to write a ""how-to"" book, but was talked into writing a ""business case"" book instead. I hope that he will soon follow up this effort with the planned ""how-to"" book.
A final question -- what is with these 1 star reviews? I've read a few of them now, for different books, and I have to question whether the reviewer has even read the book. If so, they seem to have completely missed the point.

William A. Reed,4.0 out of 5 stars,Swarm Creativity: Competitive Advantage through Collaborative Innovation Networks,Good Value - Looking for More,"Peter Gloor has created a fascinating and important book about a new form of innovation practice based largely on internet collaboration and the structure of dynamic social networks.

The author first introduces us to collaborative innovation networks (COINs) and documents their use in various forms since the beginning of humankind. COINs are deemed to be at a tipping point for driving innovation due to a convergence of factors, not the least of which is the connectivity provided by the internet.

The stated goal of the book is ""... how to leverage COINs to develop successful products in R&D, grow better customer relationships, establish better project management, and build higher performing teams"" (front cover leaf). And ""by investing in COINs, organizations have a fast, flexible, and cost-effective way to innovate and pull ahead of the competition (p. 112). Unfortunately, only a percentage of the book addresses these topics with little attention on how to actually implement COINs.

The author identifies many innovative companies by name and attributes their performance to the COIN concept. In addition, a number of technologies are described that came from COINs. These include familiar examples such as Linux, Arpanet, the Internet, along with some less known innovations. While the variety of examples provide a rich background, there is little insight into how these COINs actually functioned, and only a few references to COINs that failed to deliver on their potential.

Gloor summarizes the elements that underlie COINs as their ""genetic code"" (p. 53).
The code consists of these five elements:

1. Collaboration networks are learning networks
2. Collaboration networks need an ethical code
3. Collaboration networks are based on trust and self-organization
4. Collaboration networks make knowledge accessible to everybody
5. Collaboration networks operate in internal honesty and transparency

Through these examples, the book is mostly convincing that COINS have great potential to bring disruptive innovation to existing markets and create novel solutions where there were none before. Nevertheless, there are some inconsistencies and a few missing topics which keep this from being a really good book. Here are some of my observations:

No real introduction to complexity
While the essence of this book centers on complex social networks, there is little introduction to the subject for new readers to make sense of concepts such as self-organizing groups, small-world networks, scale-free networks and the like. This is important primer material for talking about ""swarms"" as described in the title. The limited discussion on this topic is squeezed into a chapter titled ""Ethical Codes in Small Worlds"".

Where are the swarms?
The book's title ""Swarm Creativity"" is enticing and suggests that innovation networks might be related to swarm behavior (a popular topic in complexity science). Yet, this phrase is only remotely connected with much of the discussion. For example, a Jazz ensemble is considered to be ""one of the most amazing examples of swarm creativity I know of"" (p. 23). Another example is the author's story about a project team established in the Union Bank of Switzerland. In this and other examples, the author highlights the nature of the teams to be self-selecting of members and operating with a common code of ethics. And yet, in one example, problems were ""broken down into tasks and assigned to team members (p. 31). Consequently, while the swarm idea is borrowed from complexity science it is applied here somewhat loosely and metaphorically.

Working for Free
According to the book, COIN members are typically motivated by their own egos, the chance to gain new knowledge, and the ""fun factor"" of participation (p. 29). At the same time companies can be expected to reap significant profits by using this ""open-source"" community as a cost effective innovation machine. In a free marketplace, this may be perfectly equitable, but some might be troubled by depending on a varying population of developers that are motivated by their egos and having fun. It would be helpful to have more discussion about how such COINs are maintained when the fun diminishes.

Ethics and Values
The author consistently talks about the high standard of ethics among COIN members (pp. 22, 30, 50, 52, 53, 59, 71, 75, 86, 95, 185, etc.) and seems to be confident that ""COIN members are brought together by mutual respect and a strong set of shared beliefs"" (p. 71). But he doesn't explain how this is accomplished and maintained in large COIN groups (e.g. Linux developers). Not only is the claim unsupported, but at face value it seems questionable. At the same time Gloor reports that COIN members may be subject to persecution ""because they decide to allocate some of their company working time to the goals of the COIN rather than the tasks given to them by their supervisors"" (p. 72). Thus, the discourse on ethics seems puzzling and inconsistent.

Legal obstacles
Gloor emphasizes that ""COINs usually assemble around a new idea outside of organizational boundaries and across conventional hierarchies"" (p. 11). Elsewhere he speaks frequently of collaboration across organizations and the free flow of information among everyone in the COIN. But the legal complexities of this practice are not discussed. This seems to be a critical aspect to organizations that plan to utilize COINs but also seek to protect their own IP. This deserves an entire chapter.

Why should COINs end?
If COIN members are truly motivated by the three factors identified earlier (ego, learning, fun) then it is interesting to read the author's take on why COINs end (p. 139-140). According to Gloor ""the motivating factor triggering participation in these organizations changes from sharing a vision to making money"" (p. 139). Similarly, the structure transitions from egalitarian networks to formal hierarchies. This needs more in-depth treatment as organizations investing in the development of COINs need to understand how this process occurs and what to expect should such a transition happen. But it is also important to question why COINs end if they are indeed so effective.

Final Thoughts
This is a difficult book to review. There is clearly real value here, but the message is confusing since the examples of open-source, self-organizing ""swarms"" are substantially different than the organizational teams that were described by the author later in the book. The over-abundance of references to ethical standards and codes of conduct led me to think that there must be a real problem with this, especially as groups become larger. In addition, there was only one brief example of a COIN that failed. But it's plausible that some COINs work better than others. It would be interesting to know about COINs that have varying levels of success and how they overcome their problems. Hopefully, in a future version these topics can be added to an otherwise good book.

John S. Ryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web: Designing Large-Scale Web Sites, 3rd Edition","Still handy, and still unique","There's a reason all the famous web-design folks recommend this book. It's still about the only book that addresses the design of _information_, and it still does the job very well.
O'Reilly has become justifiably famous with its user-friendly technical volumes, but this one is a bit of a departure. There isn't anything in here about how to code anything; there are no handy lists of functions or commands for easy reference. What there is is a thorough, focused but wide-ranging discussion of the issues facing someone who wants to make electronic information usable and accessible via a website.
(That includes database design, by the way. There isn't all that much detail and it's in the context of making websites searchable, but there's good discussion of e.g. controlled-vocabulary terms and how users actually look for information.)
The overall approach is refreshingly big-picture: the authors emphasize, for example, navigation _systems_ and labelling _systems_ (rather than just ""labels""), and they devote an entire chapter to ""conceptual design."" No wonder, three and a half years after its initial publication, it's still the standard reference work in a field that usually puts books out of date overnight.
And no wonder Jakob Nielsen thinks well enough of it to write the foreword. If you know who Nielsen is, you probably already have this book; but since none of the information on this page credits his contribution, it can't hurt to let readers know.
Ostensibly devoted to websites but generally applicable to any context in which electronic information has to be organized, this book should be somewhere on the shelf of every IT professional. If you like Steve Krug's _Don't Make Me Think!_ (as I do), you'll like this one too -- maybe better.

After reading the first two chapters I was convinced that the authors were on the right track. with web development in its infancy there are no standards for development of web sites that one can go by. This book, while in no way attempting to set or define any standards, attempts to list the principles and approach that an information architect should be taking when starting out on a web design project.
I found the fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters to be the very best. These chapters touch upon Navigation, Labelling, and Searching systems. The chapter on navigation systems was a relevation. Many a time navigations systems make absolutely no sense on even some of the more reputed web sites.
The chapter on Navigation systems is followed by the one on Labeling Systems. The relevation that emerges from this chapter is 'Know your target audience, and be consistent!'.
If I like this book, why don't I give this book 5 stars? Because I feel that because the authors do such a great job of explaing what 'Information Architecture' I was very disappointed by the lack of detailed examples in the book. There is one chapter at the end that deals with a real world example, but that is not enough. Something like the entire layout of a real world web site (or a hypothetical example even) that set out that web site's labelling system, the navigation system, the Searching system, etc.. would have made this book worth its weight in cybergold!

Griffin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web: Designing Large-Scale Web Sites, 3rd Edition",Great 2nd Edition Update,"This is a great book to introduce business people to information architecture, for architects to reinforce their skills, and for web designers to principles to apply to site design. The second edition has more information and is more in depth than the first, and is well worth purchasing.
The first three chapters of the book explore what information architecture is and what it is needed. Chapters 4 - 9, the ""Basic Principles of Information Architecture"" have the most substance. Several chapters bear reading several times, including:
Chapter 5: Organization Systems, Chapter 7: Navigation Systems, Chapter 8: Search Systems and Chapter 9: Thesauri, Controlled Vocabularies, and Metadata
The sections on Process and Methodologyactice, and Organizational fit are all good for people learning about IA, but may be too basic for anyone that does a lot of work or reading in the field. The Education Chapter is already out of date, which is to be expected.
IA for the World Wide Web is a great book, worth reading and worth hanging onto for reference or to use to explain the IA to others.",46

Robert David STEELE Vivas,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web: Designing Large-Scale Web Sites, 3rd Edition","Sensible, Scalable, Essential, Valuable","I read ""Ambient Findability"" first, and then bought this book. Both are excellent. This one is more focused on carefully orchestrating an approach to an enterprise architecture that makes content usable to end-users in context.

As the world gets ready to move toward exobyte scales of information sharing, at machine speed, this book becomes very relevant. While the authors are careful to point out the fallacies in cost calculations for informaiton access design flaws, I for one find the factors compelling--the cost of finding information, of not finding information, the value of rapid access, visualization and integration, the value of ease of use. I find the rough figure of $100 per employee per year to be a conservative estimate of opportunity costs--I think it is close to $1000 and in some instances $10,000.

Over-all I found this to be a superb reference for self-study, one that breaks down complex issues like different kinds of navigation systems, and one that also shows the value of offering end-users multiple means of access, both search and browsing.

Chapter 19 was especially valuable to me, since I am not even close to being a technical person or even a librarian--the itemization of the functions associated with information architecture and implementation, and why they might benefit from centralization, was a very helpful vehicle for getting a sense of the challenge when thinking of the scale of say Google, where thousands of hits are returned and thousands of relevant documents are NOT found. Google is great, but in this context, Google is in the second or third grade, at best.

I like this book, which does not claim to make anyone an information architect, because it helped me see, in a logical easy to read manner, just how *much* is involved in making tons of information accessible and usaable in time lapses and at costs that both people and organizations can afford.",25

Johnson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web: Designing Large-Scale Web Sites, 3rd Edition",Useless for techies,"I'm a developer building a company-internal website and I'm struggling to organize all the information it will contain. I bought this book hoping to ease that struggle. What I found is for a technical person like me, this book was so useless that it has compelled me to write my first Amazon review in years.

I planned to read it cover to cover. After 50 pages I realized that I haven't really read anything at all yet. So far it's been ridiculously verbose, rambling, and content-free. So I gave up and started skimming.

I couldn't find much better in the remaining pages. Page after page of touchy-feely gobbledygook that has not helped me organize information at all.

There are more useless diagrams in this book than I've ever seen before. For example, the term ""synonym ring"" is defined as a group of words with the same meaning. Does it really take a diagram with a bunch of arrows in a circle to explain that? (Figure 9-2)

To explain the concept of equivalence we have another diagram: ""A=B"" inside a circle. (Figure 9-21) Does such a diagram really enhance anybody's understanding of the concept of equivalence? Why does this diagram even exist in the first place?

Joseph Adler,5.0 out of 5 stars,Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (Springer Professional Computing),fabulous introduction to implementing ECC,"I bought this book because I was designing a cryptographic protocol, and wanted to know if I could use ECC in my design. It begins with an explanation of ""traditional"" public key cryptography (i.e., cryptography over prime fields), introduces binary fields and elliptic curves, shows how to perform computations over elliptic curves, puts this together into ECC protocols, and then includes very useful implementaiton information. This book does a good job explaining not only how to use ECC algorithms, but why they work.

As advertised, this book doesn't go into too much mathematical depth, omitting most proofs. This doesn't mean that there is no math in this book; if you don't have a decent background in algebra (no, not the stuff you learned in seventh grade), you're likely to get confused. However, if you have a little background in theoretical math and cryptography, you'll find this a very readable and easy to understand book.

The one thing that's left out of this book are intellectual property issues. Certicom owns a lot of patents on ECC, and it's not clear which ideas in this book are covered by Certicom patents. This is a minor complaint though; overall, the book is excellent. It's rare to find a book that is so exactly on target. Highly recommeneded.",13
wiredweird,5.0 out of 5 stars,Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (Springer Professional Computing),Detailed and practical,"This is the only source I've found that goes into the nuts and bolts of elliptic curve (EC) cryptography. The mathematical content is rich, although proofs are generally in references rather than in the text itself. The real value is in its many and detailed algorithm examples, and in the way it builds up to them.

Before it even gets into the text, Hankerson et al have created a model of clarity. In addition to the usual, front matter includes a list of abbreviations. If you've ever choked on the alphabet soup in other books, you'll appreciate how this makes the discussion much easier to absorb. There's also a list of the algorithms presented - what the practitioner wanted in the first place.

After an introductory chapter, the authors present finite field arithmetic in a thorough but readable way. First they present prime fields over the integers, then optimal extension fields and (most importantly) binary fields. There's nothing here for the cut&paste programmer, but dozens of algorithms help the thoughtful developer work through material that is immensely complicated in other presentations. Other goodies, like Karatsuba-Ofman fast multiplication appear here as well.

The third chapter is the book's real payload: EC techniques. I've been looking for years for a book that was so explicit in the how-to, without watering down the technical content. This is practical stuff - not just the theory of EC operations, but the techniques that make EC calculations practical for high-speed implementations.

The rest of the book - about half - discusses what to do with EC codes. That includes protocols for choosing parameters, public-key and signature algorithms, and standard kinds of attacks. It also includes hardware-level description of possible implementations, down to specific instruction sets and cache structures and different kinds of chip implementations. That leads to another set of discussions on attacks, the kind that go in through the power supply or RF emissions. Appendices provide or point to pragmatic details such as parameters to use or software support available.

The only thing that could be improved in this book is the index - it's just too brief, and lacks the thoroughness the rest of the book led me to expect. I hope you realize just how small a complaint that is. In all other ways, this book meets the highest expectations.

Highly recommended for anyone who needs to understand exactly how EC cryptography works, right down to the bit level.

Marcel,4.0 out of 5 stars,Understanding Computation: From Simple Machines to Impossible Programs,Great Practical Introductory Book,"I've gone through the first part of the book, and it is great up until now.
There are some code examples in this book that are not explained and are hard to understand, maybe the book would be better off without examples the author does not plan to explain adequately, or code examples that do not help the reader understand the subject being treated.

Most of the code examples that are not thoroughly explained are *extra* content, but I think they degrade the quality of the book instead of improve it.",4
Nick,3.0 out of 5 stars,Understanding Computation: From Simple Machines to Impossible Programs,Not too shabby,"This book does what it promises to do - take the reader from the most basic simplifications of computers (finite automata), through more complex simplifications (Turing machines) to reasoning about 'impossible' problems (The quotation marks are added because these problems will surely be solved one day or another by some clever fellow with too much brain activity and spare time, but are impossible for now). I really enjoyed the fact that the author was able to use Ruby code to illuminate his examples, which (me being a programmer) made them much easier to understand (easer being the operative word, this s*** is still complex as balls) than the mathematical notation commonly used by textbooks.

However, I feel that Mr. Stuart (much like all other authors of complicated, technical books I've read) falls into the trap of following a very predefined path for his line of reasoning, which leaves the reader with the feeling (at least, this was the case for me) that this is 'all planned out' and that there's a lot of information he intentionally leaves out or doesn't mention (this might not even be the case, but it still FEELS like this - which is a problem). If you have no idea what I'm talking about, read the book, and if you still don't know what I'm talking about then feel free to shake your head condescendingly.

Now, my interest in this particular field of computer science is cursory at best, which might not make me the ideal fit for Mr. Stuart's target audience, so if you get a major hard-on when syntax trees are generated (seek help) then you might get more out of this book than me.

That being said, he managed to peak my interest in concepts I felt were mind-numbingly boring in university (such as non-deterministic and deterministic finite automata), so kudos to Mr. Stuart for that. This book is a possible gold mine for the more interested pupil, especially when considering the problem of Turing completeness (in which he completely lost me, mid-chapter I put the book down and went to the fridge and rewarded myself with a beer for my efforts), reasoning about programs and (wait for it) generation of syntax trees.

But for the reader interested in self-study and looking for an entry ticket, this book is the answer. When I finish, I will decide whether to pursue a more rigorous treatment.

I was generally able to grasp Vapnick's theories and explanations, though often after rereading passages many times.

Simple examples would significantly aid the readability and understandability of the text - akin to the way we teach our children. We don't describe all the attributes of a rabbit, we point to a picture of a rabbit and say ""bunny"". After two or three examples of this my children know the abstract concept of a rabbit (without me having to describe a small, four legged creature with long ears, etc. and then answering the inevitable question of ""What's four legged creature mean daddy?""). Particularly with a text about learning theory, one would think it would be full of such examples - at least from a pedagogical point of view.

In addition to dealing with the important legal issues related to open source licenses the book also does a great job of discussing and analyzing the economics and community issues that are critical to understanding the open source movement in general. He also does an excellent job of discussing the various theories and philosophies behind the open source movement which I think are important to understand for those who are really interested in having a thorough understanding of open source. The author is an attorney and programmer and the book is geared more towards an audience who has a decent background or knowledge in computer programming. If you do not have a background in computer programming some of the examples and analogies the author uses are a bit hard to follow but in most cases I did not find it was critical to fully understand the examples to understand the author's point.

mathboy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Foundations of Multidimensional and Metric Data Structures (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Graphics),As good as it gets,"The best possible scenario for a reader buying a tech book is to have

1) a single author, rather than an ""editor"" so the conceptual presentation and perspective of the product is consistent throughout

2) an author that knows the field inside out and can speak and think about it naturally with no hint in the presentation that he or she has hit upon a topic they're shaky with, and needs to resort to ""high concept hand waving"" to skate over the subject.

3) an author whose command of language is first rate - precise without being pedantic, and whose tone and level of exposition remains consistent throughout.

4) an author who spares himself nothing in terms of effort, cuts no corners and leaves nothing out for the student to ""fill in"" when explaining difficult concepts.

In this book, you get all that and more.

It's an encyclopedia of multi-d DS, written by a top researcher in the field, and addresses the subject matter at every level, from the panoramic to the implementation details. This book is on par with Jim Gray's near-perfect Transaction Processing.

The book tries to expalin the concept behind each topic and provide the insight. Once the readed is equipped with those, details of practical implementations can be easily obtained from the list of references given after each chapter.

2. Mathematical rigor.

This does not mean tedious, multi-page derivations, but clearly stated *assumpions*, such as properties of functions, distributions, convergence, integrability, etc. Some key mathematical results are collected in the initial chapters. Carefully selected excersises at the end of each chapter allow the reader to familarize himself with the basics of the mathematical objects used.

3. Systematic approach.

Unlike many other books on communications, the books is *not* a collection of various modulation techniques and their performance characteristics. Instead, the authors develop very systematic approach based on signal spaces, where all modern communications technicues fall into their own places. Details of specific modulation techniques are highlighted as examples for the related concepts.

The book also has a website with errata and a few chapters which did not make it to the third edition:

[...]

Overall, the book is highly recommended to a student of communications as well as a practicing communicaiton engineer.",2

Michael J. Edelman,4.0 out of 5 stars,A Shortcut Through Time: The Path to the Quantum Computer,Exceptionally clear and enlightening,"Quantum computing is one of those things that is almost impossible to explain to someone who doesn't already have a good understanding of both quantum physics and computational theory- and yet Johnson manages to present a beautiful, elegant explanation without resorting to the typical hand-waving and metaphor that characterizes most popular books on modern physics. He explains, in clear and precise language, (1) why it is that quantum uncertainty makes powerful computing possible; (2) the nature of computationally difficult problems (i.e., those solvable in exponential time and those that are not NP-complete) (3) the physics involved in the physical realization of quantum computing, and (4) Shor's algorithm and other algorithms used in quantum computing. A beautiful, precise, and fascinating book.",1
K. Scott Proctor,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Shortcut Through Time: The Path to the Quantum Computer,Interesting Introduction to Quantum Computing,"""A Shortcut Through Time"" is a well-written introduction to the complex topic of quantum computing. Quantum computing, in a general sense, is the utilization of various quantum mechanical phenomenon, such as entanglement, for the benefit of a powerful computer, or data processing engine.

In a more basic sense, this is a book about the potential for computing devices that operate at the atomic level. This engaging and well-written book is, in various parts, a historical overview of computing, a vivid description of quantum mechanics and an exposition of the potential for quantum computing.

While written for a general audience, several advanced topics are covered in a unique manner, such as a good description of ""NP-complete"" (Nodeterministic Polynomial-time) problems.

Highly recommended for those with an interest in learning more about the potential for a new approach to computing.",1
Y. Sageev,3.0 out of 5 stars,A Shortcut Through Time: The Path to the Quantum Computer,Hoping for more...,"Even though Richard Feynman once quipped, ""...nobody understands quantum mechanics,"" I was still hoping to come away with a better understanding of quantum computing than Johnson provides. The author spends too much time covering the general principles of computing and not enough time on quantum computing. Specifically, he beats the reader over the head with the rather clear concept of the Turing machine. He forays into the tinkertoy computer -- an interesting historical curiosity, to be sure -- but does not make clear how the tinkertoy computer relates to quantum computing, other than that it is an example of a Turing machine, and does not even explain the tinkertoy machine well enough to get a clear idea of its functioning. Much the same is true for the simple Geniac switch, love of his childhood, which occupies an unseemly number of pages. At the same time, quantum computing is not covered precisely enough for the reader to digest and express the gist of it.

What is interesting to the computer programmer is a) how the program is loaded, b) how processing is accomplished, and c) how the output is read. We can set an initial state by shining a laser on a bunch of particles (Johnson pretty much leaves it at that). The problem here is that setting the initial state of a program is not the same as loading the program itself, in other words, somewhere there must be a distinction between loading code and loading data, as well as code operating on data. It seemed to me that Johnson skirts the issue by ignoring this distinction and leaving the processing ""black-box"" to the collapse of probability waves of entangled particles whose initial state was set by a laser. The probability waves' collapse -- by what mechanism we never find out -- is somehow controlled by a poorly explained mathematical theory that normally governs the behavior of cellular automata. On the other hand, if code and data are one and the same, then it seems at first blush that the output should deterministically be known at the start, or that the output would be no more helpful than the input.

My feeling persists, however unfair, that science writing should be left to the rare scientists in each field who possess the pedagogic and literary skill to explain their work to a lay audience, and not left to science journalists. Throughout the text, I kept waiting for that spark that synthesizes the concepts into some feeling of real comprehension, but never got it. Perhaps, given Feynman's assessment of quantum mechanics, that elusive spark is impossible -- especially for a popular science book. On the other hand, maybe it is and ""A Shortcut Through Time"" isn't it.",12

Thats exactly what this book is for, people with little or knowledge before hand of what quantum computer is all about.

If you've been living under a rock then this book might appeal to you. The book goes on page after page with literary fluff and very little substance. The author eloquently describes the amazing abilities of modern computers in detail like the options of tranquil background wall papers and the marvel of the trash bin. I struggled to maintain focus in this book since it rambled so far from the core idea of quantum computing. Yet even 50% through this dreaded ramble and they have barely even mentioned quantum computing. I highly advise you find another book if you are at all interested in quantum computing. This book will likely bore you and turn you off from the entire idea.,4

Firstly, I appreciate the extensive symbol table -- even if I already know the meanings of the symbols I am most concerned with, it DOES NOT HURT to list them all! Bravo!! I also enjoy the material itself: everything seems to be slanted towards modular arithmetic and factorization, so it is aimed just right at those wanting a ""leg-up"" (a southern reference to horse racing) in the computer science world, where everything depends on security and security depends upon mathematics.

But this author goes further than usual in the further sense: not only does Song present the material very succinctly and clearly, there are really cool quotes at the beginnings of the chapters that could only come from someone deeply versed in the subject. With this book, I feel that Song shares an insight into the subjects presented that most people never get in just one lifetime. There are numerous pictures of the people most often thought of as pioneers in the various subtopics, with short accounts of how that person's efforts came to fruition in our understanding of a matter. These excerpts break up the severity of the material really nicely, and help us get a bigger picture of everything.

However, the algorithm pseudocode is such that you should be able to translate any algorithm into code without much trouble. I know that this book has helped me. I would suggest that any true student of data compression methods use this book in conjunction with Sayood's book. Use Sayood to get the mathematical background that you need.

Metallurgist,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decrypted Secrets: Methods and Maxims of Cryptology,"For mathematicians, but it should be of interest to others","This book was written by a mathematician, primarily for mathematicians, however, others should find quite a bit to interest them. The book discusses the mathematics of ciphers and to get the most from the book you should have a good working knowledge of set theory, group theory, series mathematics, matrix algebra, modular arithmetic, and Galois theory. This is not to say that if you are not familiar with these fields you will find nothing of interest here. Quite the contrary, as the book also contains a lot of non-mathematical information about codes and ciphers, particularly in regards to their use in WWII. There are sections on ‘Cryptology and Human Rights” (particularly in regards to the current use of ciphers and the Internet), “Maxims of Cryptology” and the history of cryptology. I found that I learned a lot, even though I was not conversant in all of the mathematical disciplines that are utilized. Unfortunately, the author takes for granted that the reader has the requisite mathematical background and therefore does not include any general mathematical material.

I would recommend this book the mathematicians who want information about applying their mathematics to ciphers, and to experts on ciphers who want to learn more about this highly mathematical approach. I would also recommend the book to someone, like myself, who is more interested in the historical aspects of ciphers, particularly as it applies to the last 100 years. I found the book to be a good adjunct to the other that I have read on this subject, but certainly would not recommend it as a first book on the subject, or to someone with only a casual interest in it.

What is in the Book –
The book is divided into two parts – Cryptography (codes, ciphers, their classification and development), and Cryptanalysis (the techniques used decipher encrypted messages). The approach of each section is to mathematically classify the cipher in question and in the Cryptology section describe how it operates and in the Cryptanalysis part how to go about deciphering each class. The book contains numerous examples of ciphers and their solution, but in a highly mathematical framework. Unfortunately, if you are unfamiliar with the mathematics then much of this material may be quite inaccessible to you.",1
Victor A. Vyssotsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Decrypted Secrets: Methods and Maxims of Cryptology,Superb!,"This is an amazing book, and relatively inexpensive; Springer-Verlag has done it again.
Rather than being a dry recitation of encryption and cryptanalysis schemes, Bauer provides a great deal of information about what actually goes wrong when one tries to construct a cipher that must be used under pressure by non-cryptologists, with plenty of historical examples to illustrate his points. And he discusses at some length the ways in which cryptanalysts can hope to unravel ciphers and codes too strong to be broken by standard methods. Much of what he has to say I had never seen in print before; some of it was brand new to me. Perhaps it helps that Bauer is German, and doesn't have to write with the uneasy feeling that NSA or MI-6 is looking over his shoulder at every line he writes. For example, his explanation of how Robert Murphy compromised an American cipher in WW II so badly that the Germans could read it easily is one that I think some American officials would probably still prefer not to have in print.
Despite comments by other reviewers and by Cryptologia, I think it requires a certain mathematical sophistication to absorb much of the material in this book. The math is not hard, but Bauer implicitly assumes a mathematical mindset and a familiarity with the terminology of pure mathematics that most college undergraduates don't have. So I wouldn't choose it as the primary text for a first course in cryptology, but I would certainly use it as a supplementary text. I know of no other book that contains so much material on the practical realities of cryptology.",33

John McIntyre,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Engine of Complexity: Evolution as Computation,A revolutionary book that must be classed as one of the classics of the 21st Century.,"The engine of complexity is one of five great books that have made a revolutionary impact of my thinking on nature. Other 4 books are `Pi in the Sky' by John Barrow, Order out of Chaos by IIya Prigogine `End of Time' by Julian Barbour, and `The Emperors New Mind' by Roger Penrose.

I was initially reluctant to purchase this book because of popular strong AI claims in computer science that algorithms is the be all and end all to intelligence and I was not certain about a relationship between Algorithms and Complexity.

However it was clear to me that automobiles have been evolving over the last 120 years in just the same way as life has been evolving over the past 3.5 billion years and for this reason I decided to purchase this book.

The foundation of the book is based on the distinction between two different types of physical structures.

1) Those that require a code of instructions (a recipe) in order to exist. (coincidence of structure is ruled out as exceedingly highly improbable).

2) Those that do not require a code of instructions to exist.

Fig 7.1 in the book illustrates this superbly and hopefully will become iconic as E=mc2.

Compare life forms/life fossils and man made structures (including economies and institutions etc) on Earth to all other structures on Earth.

The Engine that drives complexity in nature is when these instruction codes are processed in space/time while dictated to by the laws of nature and that these outputs are copied back to the inputs with a degree of error (ideally the error is a random element so the search is not constrained within the search space.)

It is the Laws of Nature that dictate this complexity search. It is not that Engine of Complexity searches for Code that create just any physical structure, but all the successful searches code for structure that take most advantage from the Laws of Natures. For example if the instruction code resulted in the construction of a lighter with no flint, then the complexity code for this lighter would be poor and not last long (ie. will not be reproduced unless another use was found for it).

However if over 3.5 billion years, results that codes for a body that holds a large brain with the right physical structure to utilise natures laws which allow 'thinking' to take place then this complex code has the potential to be very successful and regarded as complex in our universe.

In this book I feel that John Mayfield uses the term `Computation' too loosely.

A procedure that inputs several alternatives, processes these inputs and outputs only a selection of the inputs is basically the procedure for the Engine of Complexity.

The set of selected outputs are often more complex than the set of inputs. They are often more well-matched to utilising natures laws.

However the processing part of the procedure may be a computational process or it may be a non-computational process.

In terms of natural selection, the processor is the environment and the inputs are DNA sequences. For the `Engine of Complexity' as a computational process one would have to obtain a code for the complex environment, the part that is relevant to the selection of the DNA inputs (ie possibly a subset of the universe). If this is not possible in principle then the process is a non-computational process.

The same engine drives complexity in those computer programs that utilise the same principles, but in this case the search space is more limited, constrained by the physical functioning of a computer and the coded selection factors. By virtue of being processed by a computer the selection factors must have a code and therefore the `Engine of Complexity' within the confines of computer processing is a computational process.

When we look about at the Grandeur of life of this refined 3.5 billion year evolutionary search, it is not necessarily so that the complexity generated over this time, that we experience about us, is simply the result of some Galactic Digital Computer churning through some Galactic digital algorithm, as the subtitle of this book may suggest.

It may have been more appropriate to subtitle this book as, ""Evolution as Informational Processing"".

""Evolution as Computation"" sounds good but unfortunately computation has a specific meaning in mathematics as an algorithmic process (a process that requires finite precision digital code).

The Engine of Complexity is encapsulated within The Laws of Nature.

The fuel that drives the Engine of Complexity is an Entropy Gradient.

The Entropy Gradient of the Universe can be defined as all the different states of the Universe, from the Big Bang through to a state of uniform radiation in the extreme distant future. At this current instant the entropy of the Universe is much closer to the former than the later.

Molecular Motion and chaos is also encapsulated in the Laws of Nature

As we scribe through an Entropy Gradient, Motion and Chaos abound among the astronomical but finite number of particles in the Universe. The majority of these particles/molecules interact creating more complex arrangements via Quantum Mechanics and chance. (see `Life's Ratchet', by Peter M Hoffmann.)

This is a source for `Novel Creations'.

So Nature has two Pathways to Complexity:

1) Chaotic chance ratcheted along a molecular entropy gradient - (slow and achieves only a low upper bound to complexity)

2) Engine of Complexity - (super fast and no limit to Natures complexity's upper bound)

Planet Earth is the only example we have to date of the `Engine of Complexity' in the Universe ( - it may be the only example).

When we envisage the tree of the `Engine of Complexity' on Earth we have things like Humans, dolphins, religions and economies and the arts at the top of the canopy while at the very base we have the original Engine from which all other engines were later built - (at least that is what all the data seems to indicate. As to date we have not found two fundamentally different life forms on Earth).

However even this original Engine required a considerable amount of complexity in order to operate. It is possible that the complexity of the original Engine on Earth developed via Path One. It could not develop via path two.

The Engine of Complexity is optimised when:

1) the error size (mutation) is optimised approx (1/n where n is the length of the input code string).

2) The error is a random element (that is; not limited in the search space)

It is interesting that a genuinely random element is crucial for the Engine of complexity to perform effectively. This directly relates quantum mechanics to complexity as Quantum mechanics is the only generator of purely random elements in nature.

The book also points out that our laws of nature conform to the Engine of Complexity (which is obvious else we would not be around to discuss such matters). But anthropically (if there is such a word) it is interesting to note that the Engine of Complexity does not work for all mathematical structures (possible other universes' laws of nature).

John Mayfield is a master on this broad subject and has succeeded in explaining the ideas essential for an understanding of this concept to a layperson. A joy to read.",4
Pancho,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Engine of Complexity: Evolution as Computation,Continuous improvement = evolution,"This book looks at the process that makes complex systems possible. This process is the accumulation of useful information (instructions) through small changes and selection - ""the engine of complexity"". It allows the creation of highly improbable but very useful objects: from products and services, through culture and specialized knowledge to life itself.

The author illustrates the concept with 5 examples: life, adaptive immunity, learning and thought, cultural evolution and computer code. A couple of other examples would have rounded up the exposition nicely: the continuous improvement cycle of quality management, and the accumulation of information in wikis. All of these systems display the improvement of fitness through better instructions.

It is nice to finally have a clear exposition of what these systems have in common and how they work.",2
Bas Vodde,4.0 out of 5 stars,Free as in Freedom [Paperback]: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software,Biography of the last true MIT AI hacker.,"""Free as in Freedom"" is a biography of Richard Hackman, the founder of the GNU project written by a journalist called Sam Williams. It is written under the GNU free documentation license, so can find a free copy on internet at: [...]

The writing is somewhat awkward at times. It starts at the famous story about the Xerox printer which triggered Stallman to start the GNU project years later. But then it actually moves to the biographer talking to Richard in the ""now."" It then moves back from now to history, to now etc. This is somewhat confusing and also the biographer is perhaps too much there and too much giving his opinions instead of writing the story (especially the last chapter).

The history stories of the book are pretty good though. The classic story about the printer and how emacs was created and the MIT AI Lab culture. From there it moves into the creation on GNU and its initial non-success. Also if briefly covers the conflicts between Stallman and the Open Source community, Stallman and other GNU members and Stallman and the biographer. In other words, it describes pretty well how hard it is to work together with Richard.

I like the book for the stories and its historical perspectives. I like the book for trying to describe how it is to work with a person like Richard Stallman and trying to explain that based in his history. I didn't like the writing style very much and the opinion of the author. If you are interested in Free Software history, then this would probably be a good book for you to read. Otherwise, you'd probably need to leave it where it is or just browse the free (as in freedom) internet version. 4 stars still though.

Andrew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Design and Analysis of Experiments,Good text... but take the course,"This is a good textbook if you're taking a course in engineering statistics. It is very thorough and goes farther into the theory than most people might want. As an engineer I think the theory is valuable because it is easy to improperly apply statistical analysis. Overall I think the book is clearly written and provides many real life examples. To some of the other reviewers comment though, real world means an example about a process, but Montgomery tends to be light on telling you how to do the actual analysis. If you're looking for a how to do Minitab (or any other stat software) this isn't for you. If you want to learn about statistical analysis and DOE and how to do it right, then it's a great text.

Summary:
-Clearly written
-Plenty of examples, though purchase the solutions guide if you've been assigned the homework
-Lots of theory
-Lots of real world examples
-Don't expect to learn an analysis software package

"Miguel M. ""amazonholic""",5.0 out of 5 stars,Design and Analysis of Experiments,Dr. Montgomery's book,"I used Dr. Montgomery's book as a reference material for his course under Arizona State University's six sigma black belt program. The book starts with a good review of experimental design concepts and inferential statistics. However, I do find his other book, Statistical Process Control, to be a much better inferential stat reference than this one because it does not 'rush thru' the review. Moving to chapter three is where the genius of the author becomes apparent. His approach was to discuss the theoretical aspects of a particular topic, relate it to back inferential statistics, discuss special cases or related topics (like a journal review paper), present problem/s and then show/discuss the solution using either design expert or JMP and diagrams. I cannot find any other better approach. Some of the previous books that I read are kind of 'cookbooks' which shows the reader how to do stuff using some method or software but did not really explain mathematically why it must be done in a particular way. This book did it elegantly. One reviewer mentioned that it is not a good book for hand calculation, which is true, but who does hand calculation these days? I cannot imagine myself pulling a graphing paper and drawing a response surface graph after working on several pages of calculations.

The mathematics is not really hard ... only basic arithmetic and some basic linear algebra is all you need. Integrals/differentials and PDE's are mentioned in the second chapter to describe some functions but that's about it. However, it is important to understand the concepts early and sequentially as the topics build upon each other. For my case, one chapter takes about six hours total to read. The exercises are reasonable and emphasize the important concepts. It took me about 30 min to answer a reasonably challenging question. I would suggest buying the solutions manual to reduce your heartache or erase any doubts although be aware that not all exercises have a solutions in the manual.",11

Ashley Carroll,4.0 out of 5 stars,Design and Analysis of Experiments,Stats Major Using the Textbook,"The text is well written. The homework problems are useful when testing personal knowledge.

The only downfall is if you need extra help. This book will teach you the necessary information, but if you need a book that has examples giving you a specific step by step process of what to write next then this is not for you. This book is not for beginners, but students or readers who have a good background in statistics and are looking for ways to build upon their knowledge. It gives examples, but you must use critical thinking in many cases to determine just exactly what steps were used to reach a specific conclusion.

Other than that, this is a great textbook!",1
Charles G Schreiber,5.0 out of 5 stars,Design and Analysis of Experiments,Design and Analysis of Experiments,"Design of Experiments is probably the single most important process improvement tool available. Most engineers think they understand experimental methods, and most six sigma black belts believe they understand process improvement, but without a thorough understanding of DOE, their skills are a mirage. First, DOE is a complicated method, built on many statistical foundations. Don't think you can get by with just a cursory view of the subject, and trying to understand the concepts without the proper statistical background will be difficult, although some calculus in shown, it definitely is not needed. That said, everything you need to know is in this book. The examples are simple, the calculations are easy to follow and manually repeat, and they progressively take you to more difficult concepts. The text is very well written, but this is one of those subjects which requires you to read and re-read concepts to get a full understanding. I also recommend the solutions manual with does an excellent job of showing additional examples, but you will need Minitab or Design Expert to fully appreciate them (manual calculations quickly become impossible). If you have heard about DOE and just want an overview, just do a search on-line. If you are charged with any aspect of process improvement, study this book! If you are a grad student, and this is a required text, make sure to work the examples and end of chapter problems. The concepts, after a little effort, are actually easy to understand, but they support and build on each other. If you put in the effort, this could be the most practical and valuable course you have ever taken.",9

Some of the formulas would be better understood if they followed through immediately with examples. The way it is now, the student gets a page or page and a half of formulas thrown at them then the author starts trying to relate them to actual experiments.

The examples and case studies are very well written and explained. I believe the book (and the student) would benefit with more of that and less of the other. Putting the formulas in context is what helps me understand the point the author is trying to make.",3

David C. Anderson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Design and Analysis of Experiments,"lots of formulas, little usefulness","It's unfortunate that so many people are using this book in classrooms as I found this book to be extremely light on practical value, and extremely heavy on pure theory. The author seems to be more concerned with putting the nuances of his knowledge on display than with getting the reader up to speed on how to put this very practical art to use. Put simply, the book reads much more like a journal article than a text for instruction on the subject. This is evidenced by the scarcity of real-life examples, intermixed with a host of sigmas and unnecessary formulas. There are many places where otherwise simple concepts which could be explained in a paragraph (and backed up with a few examples) are seemingly intentionally ambiguated with pages of theory thus seemingly intentionally convoluting the issue. Things I understood before even reading the book became a blur after reading. Take the introduction of 2-factor factorials for example (ch. 6). The actual calculation of these factorials is very simple, and involves nothing more than some basic arithmetic. To read this book, though, one would think that calculating them is total rocket science. Everywhere there is a chance to say ""it's easy"" or ""it's just like this but with a slight twist"" instead the author is explaining things in an array of unnecessarily complex terms.

Also, the few examples from each chapter that *are* given apparently are coming from multiple types of stats packages which obfuscates the reading even further as each page seems to contain formats, fonts, and nomenclature that are inconsistent with the last. Sometimes it's design expert, sometimes it's JMP, sometimes it's minitab - which of course all have different names for things, making this quite a puzzle to put together. Not everything is bad in the book, but I have to say there was much more bad than good. Overall I give it a D+ for classroom use.",9

Jie Zhou,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Biometrics,Great Book on Biometric Recognition,"Biometrics has been a very active research area over the past 10 years. The number of biometric deployments has increased rapidly throughout the world. However, it has been very difficult for universities to offer biometric courses for undergraduate students. Lack of a good textbook is one of the major causes. Introduction to Biometrics by Jain, Ross and Nandakumar will be indispensable for training a generation of young engineers and researchers. An excellent textbook will also significantly help instructors prepare their courses.

The authors have done a great job in balancing topics. More important biometric traits (fingerprint, face, and iris) are treated in detail, while other biometric traits are discussed briefly. The authors are also very careful in balancing subtopics. Take fingerprint recognition as an example. There exist several different methods for fingerprint representation and matching. Instead of covering all such methods, the authors have chosen the one, which is not only the most popular, but also has broader applications in other biometric modalities and computer vision problems. This will make the book easy to understand and very useful for students with different backgrounds.

Although the book covers many technologies that are quite new, it is very accessible. Take the chapter on biometric security as an example. A lot of people, including biometrics user group and even biometric researchers simply do not understand the importance as well as the difficulty of securing biometric templates. Although there are a number of technical papers and some good review papers on this topic, they are not very easy to read. But Section 7.5.1.1 of this book does an excellent job by comparing security of passwords to security of biometric templates. Figure 7.12 is quite useful for understanding the importance of securing biometric templates.

For the above reasons, I believe this book will surely become a classic in biometrics and will play a very important role in speeding up the development of biometric technology in the world. I have recommended this book for all the undergraduate and graduate students in my lab. I also strongly recommend this book to every biometric researcher and student. I definitely feel that this book has the best material to benefit people working in different areas of biometrics either in academia or industry. I have also planned to translate this book into Chinese so that Chinese researchers and students who have difficulty in understanding English can benefit from this excellent book.

This book is definitely the best book to learn biometrics at this point of time.",1
Barbara Nostrand,1.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Cryptography (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics),Do not adopt this book as your textbook,"This book should not be adopted as a textbook for a course in cryptography.

This book contains countless errors which are not even reported in the errata. Further, the book is terse to the point of not supporting the students. It presumes advanced knowledge of algebra which is not explained in the text itself. This is true when it discusses irreducible polynomials, polynomial division, and its very terse segment on Galois Theory in an early chapter.

I adopted this text for my course based in part on prior Amazon recommendations and the general reputation of the Springer UTM series. Please, do not adopt this book as a textbook unless and until Springer performs a major rewrite. My students impressions of this textbook were confirmed not only by myself, but by one of my colleagues in the department as well.

Ilya Grigorik,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Comsumption,Cute metaphor but misleading and incomplete,"""Information Diet"" is a clever metaphor, and there are some interesting parallels, but ultimately the author stretches it too thin.

The first great observation made by the author is that the problem we face today is not ""information overload"" but ""information overconsumption"". The information doesn't automatically enter our minds, instead we deliberately engage in behaviors that deliver it to us - in other words, we are not victims, instead we inflict ""information overload"" on ourselves via our day-to-day habits. Second, information just like calories can be ""refined"" to peak curiosity: shocking headlines, tabloids, notifications of all kinds, and so on. These ""empty calories"" are easy to consume, but deliver little in terms of useful information.

However, this is where the author's analogy begins to disintegrate. Yes, all information has a consumption chain: raw data, facts, trends, expert analysis, headlines and tabloids. However, to say that a ""healthy information diet"" is one that gets all, or most of its data at the source (""raw""), is simply misleading. Yes, experts add their own ""seasoning"" through their analysis, but unlike a refined carbon chain, which is only broken down the further it is processed, information and knowledge has this curious potential property of being enriched with further analysis! Not always, mind you - potential, is the key word.

In fact, the very reason I bought this book (and likely, you are considering as well) is that I implicitly assumed that the author has spent the time and effort to process, assimilate, and think through all the implications of his metaphor. In other words, we expect a ""highly processed"" work, distilled to its very essence - nothing but the good stuff. Unfortunately, that doesn't appear to be the case. Instead, we are treated to several chapters on food processing with a weak connection to our ""information diet"", and a few examples of CNN vs. Fox in the news. Disappointing.

With the fear of stretching the metaphor too thin, how about answering the following questions:
- what are, or should be, the nutrients in our information diet? Politics vs. technology vs. hundreds of other topics.
- how does one not over-consume and optimize each category?
- how does one seek out new sources and fields that you may not be easily exposed to?

And the list goes on... Unfortunately ""Information Diet"" answers none of it.",127
Arturo,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Comsumption,"Good ideas, although a bit too much of politics for me","I bought the book since I was curious about the main idea: that bad habits of information consumption may be dangerous and even unhealthy.

After having read it, I have to say that I liked the book, and I found both Clay's argumentation and the data he used to back up his main thesis, quite interesting. However it was a bit unbearable for me to read about US politics. Perhaps this is because I don't enjoy politics much, and mostly by the fact I don't live in the US.
Nevertheless, the ideas behind all of this politic argumentation, are somewhat general, and can apply to my native country, where there exist also a kind of dichotomy of two parties (the most powerful ones), and in the same way it's possible to identify the tree flavors of ignorance that leads to information obesity: agnotology, epistemic closure, and filter failure, in the voters.

Summarizing, I enjoyed the book, and besides the politic dying of it, I would recommend its reading since it's full of interesting ideas, and it's a rather good work... I'll surely re-read it again (although just the second part of the book), since I'd like to review his view of data literacy, and other interesting thoughts.",1
Deodoro Filho,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Comsumption,"A long essay, but a nice one","I rather like the food analogy the author uses throughout the book, I do agree with his comments on our bad habits on information consumption, and the premises seem to be valid for us (non-american), even though the book is aimed directly at the american public: we don't eat the same type of food, watch the same TV programs or read the same papers, still, you can pretty much detect, in my kin, the same behaviors the author describes for americans, food and information-wise. On the flip side, the last section completely loses traction, I hate ""recipes"" (self-help mumble jumble) and I'd skip it completely if I ever read it again.

It's worth mentioning it is indeed a very long essay (as some complain), still, a very well written essay: the text flows effortlessly, the ideas have the necessary citations and the conclusions are very linear and clear.",2

I did come away with some practical learnings that I was able to apply, and I don't regret the read (its easy and fast), but I think my expectations were higher than what was actually delivered.

Marcus Barber,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Comsumption,Far too sensible for most people's 'common sense',"The Information diet lays out a plan for adjusting the type of information 'junk food' we consume. Using a food diet analogy, Johnson lays out some good reasons why a better understanding of where our information comes from is important to our mental and physical health.

His ideas are relatively simple to enact and require little more than a bit of discipline to apply (which perhaps is why most people will not follow up his recommendations!). He does not recommend 'fasting' (no information access) and does suggest that readers will be best placed by understanding the way in which fast info companies fire the sugar hits at you to get you and keep you hooked.

It is an awakener for those who think that consuming information loaded with rubbish TV, trashy mags and dubious web content is okay for their kids or themselves. Sadly the audience who may be in the biggest need will be unlikely to be the ones who read this book and benefit from the ideas it contains - it is perhaps too sensible for the junk information diets of 'common sense'.",2

Ken Rider,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Comsumption,"Good info, questionable diet","Clay Johnson's ""Information Diet"" is a generally well-written book, interesting and with a sense of humor. It takes on an important topic with increasingly broad relevance. As other reviewers have noted, the core analogy, which links how we consume information to how we eat, works pretty well. Johnson gets the book's main points across in ways that are straightforward and compelling. The first half is a quick-reading tour that covers the reasons we're attracted to information and how we process it. If that was the sole purpose, then mission accomplished and good job!

But Johnson also wants to help us be healthier info consumers. It's the second half of the book - the ""diet"" part - that could be tighter. In general, The Information Diet doesn't offer too much advance over an older book: ""Data Smog: Surviving the Information Glut."" And what is new sometimes comes off as too personalized to the author's own experiences. One suggestion, to work on-line in increments of 5 to 20 minutes and then take breaks, even contradicts some of the leading insights from productivity gurus. A second issue is that Johnson focuses mainly on one part of the problem: time we spend taking in ""junky"" information. Sticking with the food analogy, he jokes that people don't have a problem eating too many vegetables. But for me and other folks, there CAN be too many veggies on-line - too much info that seems relevant and useful. The book misses a chance to offer insight on how to make smarter info choices here.

Arin Basu,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Comsumption,Everyone Should Read this Book,"Once in a while, you come across a book that forces you to think, but goes a step beyond. It provides you with the tools, it provides you with the map, guides, and directions. A book that is not just about theory and thoughts of an author, but in a flexible, simple way, lays out a map to enable you to follow the central thesis and do for yourself. The information diet is such a book.

The book begins with a metaphor that Clay Johnson expands that too much information is like too much food that people consume and that, there is a case for conscious consumption of information and understanding the meaning of information, going beyond the surface and dig deeper into where this information comes from and what does that mean. And then it lays out a plan for you how you can streamline your information feed, understand the meaning and form a social group to appreciate the stream of information coming your way.

I think this combination of theory and its tools is the killer feature of the book. We live in an age where we need to be conscious of information that comes our way, and need to guard ourselves from mindless propaganda and slogans and messages doled out by ""fanboys"" of the world. More so, as we see emergence of so-called ""social media"" and information ""overload"" around us.

I think this book should be must read and possibly be on the reading list of everyone. The text is clear, simple, fast paced. Most importantly, it's not a boring book. Read it. I absolutely loved reading this book, and it now stays by my side.

Study and practice The Information Dietby Clay Johnson. Johnson helps you to make choices to avoid information overconsumption. His first claim: information overload doesn't exist, just as food overload is nonexistent. It's the amount and - more important - quality that you consume, that makes or breaks your (mental) health. The author digs this metaphor over and over again and shares good practices for better information consumption, such as:
setting priorities and turn away from distractions. Turn off notification bleeps and icons, spend larger amounts of time concentrating on one task. Think of the lessons in Timothy Ferris' 4 Hours Work Week, the psychological concept of flow and David Allen's Getting Things Done.
avoid reading and watching likeminded sources of information. Get challenged, seek diversity, opposing view points and new insights to keep you fresh and hopefully better informed.
Use social media, but be aware of their shortcomings when it comes to desinformation on purpose. Do research, check, dig into the deeper web, go to a traditional library.
After this practical and very useful howto's Johnson describes the political landscape and information spinning process in the US, less relevant to non-US readers like me. True to the spirit of the book, I disregarded that part as an unnecessary waste of time and attention.

Paul E. Lemieux,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Comsumption,A perceptive look at our information sources - and a way forward!,"Remember when it used to be fun to discuss politics, government, religion, society, and all the weighty issues of the day? It would be unfair to say there was a national consensus, exactly. But there were left and right positions that enriched the debate and stimulated ideas. The great American ""middle"" moderated the whole, and on balance, gave us a sense of place, of order, of direction, and perhaps of a national identity.

In the last decade a new and insidious phenomenon has become the norm. Intelligent, rational people can be on complete opposite sides of an issue, and be absolutely certain of their contradictory ""facts"". And have no capacity at all to even weigh the opposite possibility. Is it because of the growth in our population, the increasingly complex multicultural mix, or are we just plain cranky, aging baby boomers?

Clay Johnson, in ""The Information Diet"" has accurately nailed two powerful ingredients in this stew. While we used to hunt for information to aid in the search for truth, the unlimited voices of the internet has made it easy (nearly unavoidable) to simply seek affirmation of our point of view. Let's just feel good about our prejudices rather than struggle with the complexity of difficult ideas. Oh, and by the way, your neural pathways are busy hardwiring in the self-righteousness of your bias.

""The Information Diet"" is not just an interesting read, it's a pointer in the right direction to help us find a way back to civility, to active and respectful debate, and to re-open the path to creating an educated and forward-looking citizen nation.

While this can be an incredible thing, it also has problems. Many people complain of Information Overload, and people have a hard time dealing with their inboxes, social networks, news feeds, etc. If you have this problem, then Clay Johnson may have the solution for you. He calls it The Information Diet.

According to Johnson, the problem isn't too much data: it's too much of the wrong data. He equates our information overconsumption to the obesity epidemic. Not all calories are equal, and neither are all information sources. He says that there is ""no such thing as *information overload*"". No one is forcing us to consume the data, just as no one is forcing us to binge on McDonald's and KFC.

The Information Diet is laid out in three parts. The first section describes the problem, the second section describes how an information diet works, and the third is a call to action. In the first section, Johnson lays out just how bad our information consumption is. We binge on entertainment disguised as news(Fox News, MSNBC, The Huffington Post, and many, many others.) We hang out with people who share our views, whether it's online or in person. We fall into the three traps of agnotology, epistemic closure, and filter failure.

Briefly, agnotology is the phenomenon that causes people who are more informed about an issue to become more entrenched in their views. An epistemic closure is caused by depending on views from only your side (so conservatives can't believe what liberals say, because if its liberal, it must be a lie, and vice versa. Johnson uses Climate change to describe this.) Most people are already familiar with Filter Failure: the problem caused by algorithms that pay attention to how we search and how we click, and respond accordingly by showing us more of the same at the expense of other voices.

Obviously, this is just a brief description of the problem and Johnson goes into more detail. In part two, he presents a solution: The Information Diet. While I won't give away his solution, it involves things like getting your news locally (but not from TV), going to original sources, learning better search techniques, using ad blocking software, and seeking balance. While I agree with much of what he says in this section, I do have a problem with ad-blocking software (there are good information sources that depend on ads to exist. Book Review blogs like The Rumpus, The Millions, HTMLGiant, and others couldn't exist without ads.) I use ad-blocking software, but only for sites that use intrusive advertising (anything that prevents me from reading the content).

The third section, Social Obesity, describes how people can work together to fix the problems with our information consumption. Johnson worked on the Howard Dean campaign, and on Obama's social media campaign leading up to his election. He knows how grassroots (and fake grassroots) organizations really work, and how effective they can be. But we have to be aware, and we have to spread that awareness.

Would I recommend this book? Absolutely. There's a lot of important information here.",7
Max C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Comsumption,Horrible book,"This book is horrible. The author rambles on and on with stories of his personal life that are not even relevant to the topic at hand. One of the worst books I have ever read.

Basically, if you read the description of the book, you have already read the entire book minus the boring personal stories.",3
Paul D,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Comsumption,A Great Discussion With a Personal Touch,"First of all this book is a quick read, a virtue in a work targeted at those suffering from information overload and over consumption. The general premise of The Information Diet is admittedly simple enough to deduce from the title. The ways in which we consume information and the impacts information has on us and our well being are comparable to our relationships with food. What follows from that are truths that we must realize if we are to be responsible consumers of information. I'll be honest, I expected preaching and lecturing about bad information and a holier than thou attitude as comes from many ""self help"" books, videos, and sources. This book is anything but, the strongest parts of the message come from personal stories of the author's own troubles with information that I couldn't help sympathize and empathize with. Other reviewers have cited the personal anecdotes as a negative but I think this is quite the contrary and essential to the message of the book. While I won't spoil all of the content, a key observation is that healthier information, like healthier food, often is consumed closer to the source. What is closer to the source of someone trying to make this point than personal experience itself? In my opinion this is the only way to hammer home the point. Without the personal touch the book and message would be dry. The discussion of a Democrat operative's (the author) meeting of Karl Rove and the impact it had is in itself worth the price of admission for this book. Knowing Clay's previous involvement with technology and being a geek myself I must say I find the appendix that is essentially a call to arms for programmers to be particularly poignant and relevant to the world today. Those of us that work with computers and information systems must realize and respect the power of information in this world. I'll say if you code, do IT or something related, this is a must read chapter.",12
wealthandtaste,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Comsumption,A Long Essay At Best,"Even though I agree with the central premise that 'attention' as a skill has been denigrated in modern society, I am embarrassed to have been tricked by the lofty description into purchasing this book. A writer of moderate skill could have condensed this rambling, disjointed, anecdote-laden piece into a long essay at most. The first clue to the absurdity of this book is that the introductory pages encourage the reader to visit the Twitter account, Facebook account, and website dedicated to... consciously consuming less fluff. It goes downhill from there as the reader is treated to a weird extended metaphor between poor diet, and information consumption. Thus if the narrative presented is correct (information consumed needs to be monitored just as closely as food consumed), then the reader is justified in ignoring the admittedly obese author out of hand, based upon their very own flawed premise. Potential buyers can save themselves the purchase price of this book by reading the wikipedia entry on meditation, purchasing RescueTime, and deleting their social media accounts.",30

Sitting in Seattle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"More Math Into LaTeX, 4th Edition",Excellent for authors of articles and books,"If you're working on journal articles or a monograph using LaTeX, this is a great book. In particular, it serves two audiences quite well: newcomers to LaTeX who want a thorough and readable conceptual introduction, and more experienced LaTeX users who are ready to move beyond the basics.

For my part, I had used LaTeX for a couple of years to do things like Beamer presentations when I needed technical slides. Then I started work on a monograph that needed a much more complete set of LaTeX features: table of contents, index, chapters, bibliography, and so forth.

The core of this book is coverage of articles and books, so it's great for those. It does NOT pretend to be a systematic reference; there are a number of tables of symbols and the like, and an excellent index, but it's designed more to teach than to be purely a reference volume.

Sure, you can find ""the answer"" to most LaTeX questions online -- but only if you know what to ask, and with no systematic presentation. This book helped give me a much more systematic perspective and saved me tremendous time with its tips and directions of where to look. It is also surprisingly readable, as much as a technical book can be. I find it enjoyable to flip through or take to the doctor's office and browse topics, and I always learn something.

Finally, for anyone working on a book, this volume stands out for its very helpful (although brief) coverage of issues related to longer documents such as monographs: include, includeonly, indexing, and so forth. In addition to the core LaTeX functionality, it also briefly examines the Springer monograph class (which makes sense because it's a Springer book).

Overall it's the most helpful of the few LaTeX books I have. Thanks to the author for the care to produce it!",2

The section on hyperref (links to files, URL, bookmarks) is weak. The suggested package has limitations which the author did not mention except to say that ""if none of these work, you are out of luck."" The new chapter on presentation with baby beamer is a good addition. It is certainly easier to follow than the full-version of Beamer user's guide, which is available on-line. The book does have an excellent index, which makes finding specific topics easy. The appendix on installation of LaTex and other supporting packages is written in a style for beginners, who will surely appreciate it.",9
Curtis D. Mobley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"More Math Into LaTeX, 4th Edition",The perfect introduction to Latex,"I have been using WordPerfect for many years to write papers full of complicated equations. However, I was required by a publisher to start writing in Latex, which I had never used. Grätzer's book got me up to speed within a few days. I'm now halfway proficient in Latex, but his book remains at my side for reference when I need a see how to compose some new bit of math I haven't used before. This is one of those rare books that are exactly, 100% what I needed to learn a somewhat complicated topic, and I just can't find anything to criticize. I highly recommend it to the new Latex user and to users who need a reference where they can see how to compose a particular bit to math.

BTW, I am now converting many of my old WordPerfect documents into Latex. For that I first use the WP to Latex shareware converter put out by J. Fojtik. It isn't perfect, but it gets the process started. I then clean up the resulting *.tex file as needed using PCTeX software, which I find very convenient for debugging, importing figures, and such.",5
Trevor Burnham,5.0 out of 5 stars,"More Math Into LaTeX, 4th Edition",Thorough and clear intro to LaTeX,"The title might mislead you into thinking that this book is an advanced treatise on the more obscure aspects of mathematical typesetting. It's not. Instead, this fine book serves as a comprehensive introduction to LaTeX, the most popular dialect of TeX, for those who've never used it before. If you're already familiar with TeX, then you can skip the first chapter and dive right into tutorials that are chock-full of useful nuggets.

There are woefully few up-to-date books for those of us (academics, mostly) learning TeX in the 21st century. There are plenty of websites, to be sure, but some of us still crave the ease and reliability of a solid paper reference. This is the only book on TeX that you will ever need.",5

I often find myself going out to YouTube to re-explain the scenario. The book, for me, is a guide on placing the technical elements in a context that makes a bit of sense. Granted, I am only a few chapters in. If I didn't need this for class I would be on YouTube for this content instead.

I especially like the complete samples of various database(s) as well as samples and code where applicable on the companion CD. With the CD you have the ability to load all these items onto your computer and make the references available at all times.

The greatest asset on the companion CD for me is the PDF file of the complete book. As I get older my eyesight is not like it used to be and I have trouble reading many books and periodicals. Having the book on PDF format makes it very easy for me to read.

The diagrams/figures are barely readable with faint wording that's smaller than microprint. It's nanoprint. The publisher's website isn't helpful.

The authors say they assume readers are running 32-bit Windows 7. This should be said upfront in the book's description. Bottomline, it's hypocritical to use Access 2007 samples to teach Access 2010. And, the entire book has poor print quality. I'm returning it.",50

M.J. Headlee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Number Theory: An Introduction via the Distribution of Primes,Fantastic Second Book on Number Theory,"This book is an excellent second book to Number Theory. If you've already had number theory, you will have seen the topics they are presenting in bits. What this book gives more than anything is CONTEXT. That context is very valuable and can help direct you to future readings.

Most other number theory books are rather ad-hoc. You do some congruences, then you see some quadratic reciprocity, then maybe some neat facts about divisors and perfect numbers. Not so here. While Fine and Rosenburger do tackle those topics, everything is framed in the context of prime numbers. In particular, they take pains to introduce specifically (i) analytic number theory (Including Dirichlet's proof et the prime number theorem), (ii) algebraic number theory, and (iii) additive number theory (Waring problem). They also have a section on cryptography and a proof of the AKS algorithm. There is an entire chapter devoted to nearly 15+ proofs that there are infinitely many primes, using basic techniques as well as more advanced methods from topology and analysis. That alone makes the book a gem.

This book seems better suited as a second book in number theory because of the perspective they take. They look down on number theory from Modern Algebra to give their sweeping panorama. While they do have presentations on things like Ring Theory in the book, if you are seeing that for the first time with this book you will be busy digesting Ring Theory instead of appreciating that perspective. You can also see the context of all the other ""random things"" that prior books have done.

Overall, a fantastic reference I am glad to have on my shelf. But I wouldn't want to start from here.",7

Man Kam Tam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finite Fields and Applications (Student Mathematical Library),An Excellence Individual Study Book on Finite Fields and Its Applications,"To transmit photos from Mars back to earth, to download files from Internet where the server resides a few thousand miles away, and to send email globally are fascinating. Thus to understand the mathematics which made ""... possible for the person receiving a message to detect and correct errors that have arisen during the transmission process"" is interesting. ""The detection of errors is accomplished by noticing that the received sequence is not a codeword ... For some code, it is possible for the receiver to determine, with high probability, the intended message when the received sequence is not a codeword. Such codes are ... called error-correcting codes."" Gary L. Mullen and Carl Mummert's ""Finite Field and Applications"" introduces the error-correcting codes (algebraic coding theory) and the related mathematics. The book has four chapters. They are: finite fields, combinatorics, algebraic coding theory, and cryptography.

The chapter of algebraic coding theory includes (a) basic properties of codes (linear code, parity-check digits, parity-check matrix, parity-check equation, and systematic form), (b) bounds for parameters of codes (Hamming bound, Plotkin bound, Singleton bound, and Gilbert-varshamov bound), (c) decoding methods (nearest neighbor decoding and syndrome decoding method), (d) code constructions (Hamming, cyclic, BCH, and Goppa codes), (e) codes and combinatorial designs, and (f) codes and Latin squares.

On chapter four, symmetric key cryptography (automatic teller machines over public phone lines), public key cryptography (the RSA cryptosystem, Double-round quadratic enciphering, the Diffie-Hellman system, Elliptic curves and elliptic curve cryptography), and threshold scheme (to split a piece of secret information among several individuals) are introduced.

The chapter of combinatorics introduces (a) Latin squares, (b) affine and projective planes, (c) block designs, and (d) Hadamard matrices.

The first chapter, the most important chapter, introduces finite fields, extension fields, trace and norm functions, bases (linear algebra), and polynomials (over finite fields). It is interesting to learn the properties of finite fields such as: prime subfield and the field Fq is isomorphic to the ring Zp of integers modulo p (when p is a prime). The properties of the polynomials in finite field are also interesting. For example, ""every function defined on a finite field can be represented by a polynomial with coefficients in that field."" In other words, ""Every function f:Fq->Fq can be represented by a unique polynomial over Fq of degree at most q-1."" Polynomials have many important properties: (a) values are easily computable, (b) easily differentiated and integrated, and (c) vanish at only a finite number of points.",11

JazzLover7,1.0 out of 5 stars,Data Modeling Made Simple with PowerDesigner (Take It With You),Poorly conceived,"I own PowerDesigner but have yet to figure out how to use it. I purchased it for about $65 on an academic basis and took a data modeling course only to discover the hard way that BEFORE you get to data modeling, if you want to do data modeling with a serious database product like SQL Server, you've got to know both SQL Server and database design in SQL Server. I was a PC database programmer for about 7 years, played around with Access 2010 and thought, ""What could be the difference?"" Well, was I wrong.

That being said, the premise of this book is that you will start with conceptual data modeling (CDM), proceed to logical data modeling (LDM)and finish with physical data modeling (PDM). Guess what: If you don't know what I'm talking about, this book will do you no good.

Moreover, I don't believe that the CDM -> LDM -> PDM route is the way to go. That's because there are many Access developers out there who can get their hands on SQL Server. They should begin with the PDM because that's what they relate to and proceed to LDM and then the CDM. This is just to learn how to think in terms of PowerDesigner, then begin with the CDM.

PowerDesigner is a very powerful product; it does more than data modeling. But you'll have to learn data modeling first, then use this book, and I still don't believe this book is the right way to go. It teaches you how to (i.e.) delete diagrams, but I don't remember how to, for example, create rules. That's why I gave up.

Yet data modeling is critical to good database design and systems design. If you need a data modeling tool and can get PD, consider it. So far as I can tell, this is the only book on PowerDesigner out there now.",4

You would think that a book on this subject would start out by telling what the entity framework is and what it can do for you. Then it would go on to tell you how to make an entity domain model, and after that show you how to use it.

David M. Kulpanowski,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beginning Spatial with SQL Server 2008 (Expert's Voice in SQL Server),Spatial Analysis for Databases,"I would give this book a high recommendation. Using this book I was able to take GPS data of ambulances travelling around our county and import it into SQL Server 2008, spatialize the tables and write queries against it. Examples of my queries are; what is the distance between standby locations and the subsequent dispatch location? How far away are emergency incidents from the fire station? By hour of day, where are emergency incidents happening within the county? Where in the county are we NOT meeting our response time standard?
I used to use ArcInfo for this type of work, but processing all the spatial data within SQL Server makes a lot of sense. It eliminates several steps such as exporting the data out of the database, importing it into ArcGIS and making points, then doing point in polygon overlays. Beginning Spatial with SQL Server 2008 goes a long way towards helping me perform operational planning for Fire Services and Emergency Medical Services. This book helps me solve real-world problems. Mr. Aitchison has a clear writing style and the book covers topics that are useful for solving geographic issues.
So many issues in business and government have a spatial component such as: which schools in Detroit to close, where to locate a new fire station in Fort Myers, where are customers relative to my stores, etc. This book goes a long way in helping you analyze your spatial data.

The feeling I get is that the author is paid by number of pages so we get some additional things like creating Web applications in Visual Studio which maybe could have been left for another book and instead focus on SQL Server 2008 and the functionality.....

Grant Fritchey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beginning Spatial with SQL Server 2008 (Expert's Voice in SQL Server),Fantastic Introduction,"When I started reading Alastair Aitchison's book on Beginning Spatial with SQL Server 2008 I thought to myself, ""Wow, I'm glad this is the beginning book."" The concepts that make up spatial data and the means necessary to store and retrieve this data from your SQL Server database are quite difficult. Luckily Mr. Aitchison has written this book. I've just read the entire thing, running most of the samples. My copy has a number of post-it flags hanging out all over the place on topics that I want to re-explore or explore in more depth. I'm already planning on handing this off to co-workers so that they can learn the basics of working with spatial data as well.

The book is very clearly written. All the examples I tried worked. As I said before, Mr. Aitchison does a great job of explaining very difficult concepts so that even someone completely new to the topic will understand. That's the goal of a beginners book and it is very well met.

Now I want to see Intermediate Spatial please?",5
Jason Enochs,5.0 out of 5 stars,Entity Framework 6 Recipes,"Second edition, same great book!","I've owned the previous version of this book, ""Entity Framework 4 Recipes"", for a couple years so this purchase was to keep up-to-date on the latest EF features. The first rating of this book (1 star) was simply random gibberish so don't be thrown off. My copy arrived in good condition and I have no problem with the print quality. Figures, tables, and other references are readable. The new edition is printed on slightly smaller pages but it looks to me like the same amount of print with less white space (smaller margins).

I have read recent reviews of other books published by Apress that complain about the new cover design being faded (washed out). This is my 2nd book with this new cover design and neither are faded.

This book simply updates the previous edition with the new Entity Framework 6 features. Also, chapter four now focuses more specifically on MVC. If you haven't started using MVC yet (shame on you!), then you may want to keep the previous version along side this one. After you take into account the updated features that were added, the rewrite of chapter 4, and omission of chapter 15 (Advanced Modeling), you still have a book that inherited the majority of its content from the previous version. For me, that's exactly what I was looking for. Disclaimer: I have only read the first edition and the first two chapters of this updated edition (it just arrived in the mail). I thumbed through the remaining chapters & did a side-by-side comparison.

When I purchased the first edition, I was nervous because I was new to EF programming and afraid that a recipe style book wouldn't provide the basics needed to get up-to-speed. While this style usually targets more experienced programmers, the authors of this book provide enough basic information up front to ensure most anyone can follow along. That basic information has not changed much in this updated edition.

If you want to see an accurate rating of this book based on more than one or two reviews, check out the previous edition (Entity Framework 4 Recipes). I have them both in front of me and feel that they are similar enough for someone to roughly gauge the new edition based on the reviews of the previous edition. Same authors...same basic content and chapter layout... more MVC specifics... updated features and capabilities based on EF 6. What else could you ask for?

[UPDATE] It's been a 1.5 years since I wrote this review. After reading the more recent reviews I will agree that this book is not the best for beginners. I stated that I learned EF from the previous edition of this book but I also have a CS degree and I'm an experienced Software Developer.",18
Colby Giles,2.0 out of 5 stars,Entity Framework 6 Recipes,Lots of code errors,"The descriptions in the book are good, and sufficiently detailed to understand what is going on. My problems stem from the fact the the code examples in the book more often than not do not work as advertised. I have come across numerous issues where I had to modify the code examples to get the output the authors claim to get with the faulty code. This indicates that the code examples that they used were not tested or reviewed. This does not inspire confidence. Especially when what I am trying to learn is code dependent in a lot of cases.

Superb job at covering major DB concepts.
The writting of the book as well as exceptional orginization of the book show that the author is indeed an expert on the topic. I found that while the author is not the best at explaining the concepts in the book, he is still very good. This leaves the reader with some thinking to do in order to fully understand the material (which is fine).
The book is very wordy. This is positive becuase it keeps the book interesting and not dry. (The author is very good at connecting with the reader, something not found in many computer books). On the negative side it opens the door for more error of interpretation(although the author's skills prevent this, mostly). On complicated issues in which a section needs to be re-read several times, there is much more to read.
Last, b/c of the wordiness most of the book cannot be used as a quick reference guide. (So students make sure to underline, highlight...)

This book is geared to people interested in learning the theoretical analysis of Relational Databases stemming from mathematical analysis. This approach is highly impractical for real-world applications and will remain as conversation material for academics. This book is frustrating to read since the author constantly makes references to material that is not addressed in this book, illegal use of SQL (utilizing the ""#"" for illustration purposes) and not indicating clearly how his examples have deviated from the way it is ""traditionally done"". The author is frustrated and spends too much time berating other people's work, and his attempt to explain SQL is poorly illustrated. This book is mistakenly referred to as the bible of relational databases and the only explanation I can think for this is that it has been around for so long and read by so many people that are endeared by the unreachable tone of his writing, that they assume this is how it should be written. After seven editions I would expect perfection, and this book is a far cry from it. Spend your money and desire to understand the theory behind Relational Databases somewhere else.",9

Adam DeRidder,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pro Data Backup and Recovery (Expert's Voice in Data Management),Worth the time for lower to mid-level backup folks,"Firstly, to give context - IT is a rapidly changing field. It's hard to write a book that
is relevant now and stays relevant for the next 5 years when even the fundamentals of
the field change within a few years and in technology advances in unpredictable ways
making previously exotic backup strategies commonplace.

Secondly, to the strengths of the book. There were a dozen different few instances where I
appreciated Mr Nelson's pains to point out and clarify areas of common confusion - difference
between differentials and incrementals and levels, archive v backup, dedupe v SIS. Understanding
those differences sets apart the professional from the dabbler.
He also spends a large amount of time on concepts and definitions that will stay relevant, and
teaches how to evaluate trade-off situations. These will be universally useful.
I also like the fact that he refers to explicit products (and the he breaks that into chapters
so people can choose to skip sections irrelevant to them) to give concrete value to his information.

However, there are several instances where I was frustrated by the opposite - confusing
the notation of Mbit network rate with MB transfer rates to disk. Giving DLT data in the marketing
terms - estimated speeds and capacity after compression rather than uncompressed, or when he gives
a warning on how NOT to apply a formula for estimating the number of drives- then seems to do do
precisely what he warned us nOT to do.

Lastly, the book is not aimed at backup professionals who want to sharpen their skills, but
at entry-to-midlevel backup folks who need some a referesher on RAID levels/tape capacity/architecture.
In many ways it reminded me alot of the book you'd get from a training class on backups - slightly
idealized. I would have appreciated more real-world advice from an apparent grizzled vetran -
addressing the most common pain points of admins - best practices, tips, most important metrics, capacity
planning, pitfalls. But on the other hand, on the topics he covers, he does often take pains to do
just that.

I am new to backups. This book helped me to sound intelligent about the field and gave me background in
areas I would not have found on my own for a year. My company bought it for me and it was well worth
the money and time. Thanks, Steve.",2

Reading the great reviews, I purchased this.. and was shocked at the low quality and very limited information within. These reviews at Amazon are too often written by friends and associates of the authors to promote the book, not to give readers an honest appraisal.

My best advice is that you should read a chapter before making the decision to purchase this book. When I saw the hundred++ pages of text dedicated to the (non-oracle specific) most basic introduction to database systems, exactly like in 100 books written over the last 20 years.. I was worried, rewritting other material is an easy way to increase your page count. Padding is completely unnecessary when there is so much information to convey and to learn about Oracle DBA, it completely detracts from the focus, and reduces the space for real information, and it conveys a sense that the author doesn't have depth in the subject, as I found when the text got into Oracle specific details.. it was no deeper than the most novice introductory material you find on the internet.

Virtually useless for an aspiring Oracle DBA. I'm surprised that the company allowed this to be printed in this state, as I have several other of their books that are GREAT , such as ""Expert Oracle Database 11g Administration"". That book is a thousand times better introduction, even for the beginning oracle DBA. Read the first chapter of that book, and you'll see what I mean.

I'm sure this review will be rated very low by all the author's supporters, but the only intention of my review is to save you time and money, (I wish someone had provided such a review for me).

unicityd,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Block Cipher Companion (Information Security and Cryptography),A solid introduction to block ciphers and cryptanalysis,"This book provides a fantastic introduction to block ciphers and cryptanalysis.

Pedro A. Ortega,4.0 out of 5 stars,Universal Artificial Intelligence: Sequential Decisions Based On Algorithmic Probability,A gem under a pile of unnecessary mathematical obfuscation,"This is probably the most rigorous attempt to formalize AI. The book succeeds in presenting the state-of-the-art AI theory from a technical point of view, but neglects intuition, and is difficult to read for the novice and thus inaccessible to a wider audience.

The main idea of the book in combining classical control theory concepts with Bayesian inference and algorithmic information theory. The author avoids to struggle with anthropocentric aspects of intelligence (which are subject to a fierce debate) by defining intelligent agents as utility maximizing-systems. The core ideas are, in a nutshell (informally):

1) Goal: Build a system with an I/O stream interfaced with an environment, where inputs are observations and outputs are actions, that optimizes some cumulative reward function over the observations. Two ingredients are necessary: model the a priori unknown environment and solve for the reward-maximizing actions.

2) Model: This is a probability distribution over future observations conditioned on the past (actions and observations). Instead of using any particular domain-specific model, the author uses a weighted mixture over ""all"" models. By ""all models"", the set of all mechanically calculable models is meant, i.e. the set of all algorithmically approximable probabilistic models.

3) Policy: Given the model, all possible futures can be simulated (up to a predefined horizon) by trying out all possible interaction paths. Essentially, a huge decision tree is constructed. Having this information, it is ""easy"" to solve for the best policy. Just pick at each step the action that promises the highest expected future rewards. These are calculated recursively using Bellman's optimality equations.

Why does this work in theory? If the environment is equal to one of the models in the mixture (or ""close enough""), then the mixture model converges to the true environment. The model is updated step by step using Bayes' rule. Since the model becomes more accurate, the policy based on it converges to the optimum. Algorithmic information theory is the main tool to derive the mathematical results.

Does it work in practice? Unfortunately, the presented solution cannot be implemented in practice, because the mixture model is incomputable. Even worse, there is currently no principled way to downscale his approach (and make it practical), since we don't know how to simplify (a) the mixture model and (b) the computation of the policy. The author makes these points very clear in his book. IMHO these are the main challenges for future AI research.

The PROs: This is the first time I see a unified, formal and mathematically sound presentation of artificial intelligence. The proposed theoretical solution provides invaluable insight about the nature of learning and acting - hidden even in very subtle details in his approach and in his equations. Whereas you might feel that classical AI or commonplace Machine Learning theory looks like a patchwork of interesting concepts and methods, here (almost) everything fits nicely together into a coherent and elegant solution. Once you have studied and understood this book (which took years in my case), it is very difficult to go back to the traditional approaches of AI.

The CONTRAs: However, there are some downsides to this book. Hutter is a brilliant mathematician and sharp thinker. Unfortunately his writing style is very formal and many times he neglects intuition. The book introduces difficult notation (although some of it pays off in the long run) that ends up obfuscating simple ideas. The mathematical style of the book is difficult to digest.

To summarize, this books represents a giant leap in the theory of AI. If you have advanced mathematical training and enough patience to study it, then this book is for you. For the more practically-oriented researcher who wants to learn about Universal AI, I recommend reading Shane Legg's ""Machine Super Intelligence"".",16
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Universal Artificial Intelligence: Sequential Decisions Based On Algorithmic Probability,Very ambitious project.,"This book differs from most books on the theoretical formulations of artificial intelligence in that it attempts to give a more rigorous accounting of machine learning and to rank machines according to their intelligence. To accomplish this ranking, the author introduces a concept called `universal artificial intelligence,' which is constructed in the context of algorithmic information theory. In fact, the book could be considered to be a formulation of artificial intelligence from the standpoint of algorithmic information theory, and is strongly dependent on such notions as Kolmogorov complexity, the Solomonoff universal prior, Martin-Lof random sequences and Occam's razor. These are all straightforward mathematical concepts with which to work with, the only issue for researchers being their efficacy in giving a useful notion of machine intelligence.

The author begins the book with a ""short tour"" of what will be discussed in the book, and this serves as helpful motivation for the reader. The reader is expected to have a background in algorithmic information theory, but the author does give a brief review of it in chapter two. In addition, a background in sequential decision theory and control theory would allow a deeper appreciation of the author's approach. In chapter four, he even gives a dictionary that maps concepts in artificial intelligence to those in control theory. For example, an `agent' in AI is a `controller' in control theory, a `belief state' in AI is an `information state' in control theory, and `temporal difference learning' in AI is `dynamic programming' or `value/policy iteration' in control theory. Most interestingly, this mapping illustrates the idea that notions of learning, exploration, adaptation, that one views as ""intelligent"" can be given interpretations that one does not normally view as intelligent. The re-interpretation of `intelligent' concepts as `unintelligent' ones is typical in the history of AI and is no doubt responsible for the belief that machine intelligence has not yet been achieved.

The author's formulations are very dependent on the notion of Occam's razor with its emphasis on simple explanations. The measurement of complexity that is used in algorithmic information theory is that of Kolmogorov complexity, which one can use to measure the a prior plausibility of a particular string of symbols. The author though wants to use the `Solomonoff universal prior', which is defined as the probability that the output of a universal Turing machine starts with the string when presented with fair coin tosses on the input tape. As the author points out, this quantity is however not a probability measure, but only a `semimeasure', since it is not normalized to 1, but he shows how to bound it by expressions involving the Kolmogorov complexity.

The author also makes use of the agent model, but where now the agent is assumed to be acting in a probabilistic environment, with which it is undergoing a series of cycles. In the k-th cycle, the agent performs an action, which then results in a perception, and the (k+1)-th cycle then begins. The goal of the agent is to maximize future rewards, which are provided by the environment. The author then studies the case where the probability distribution of the environment is known, in order to motivate the notion of a `universal algorithmic agent (AIXI).' This type of agent does not attempt to learn the true probability distribution of the environment, but instead replaces it by a generalized universal prior that converges to it. This prior is a generalization of the Solomonoff universal prior and involves taking a weighted sum over all environments (programs) that give a certain output given the history of a particular sequence presented to it. The AIXI system is uniquely defined by the universal prior and the relation specifying its outputs. The author is careful to point out that the output relation is dependent on the lifespan or initial horizon of the agent. Other than this dependence the AIXI machine is a system that does not have any adjustable parameters.

The author's approach is very ambitious, for he attempts to define when an agent or machine could be considered to be `universally optimal.' Such a machine would be able to find the solution to any problem (with the assumption that it is indeed solvable) and be able to learn any task (with the assumption that it is learnable). The process or program by which the machine does this is `optimal' in the sense that no other program can solve or learn significantly faster than it can. The machine is `universal' in that it is independent of the true environment, and thus can function in any domain. This means that a universal optimal machine could perform financial time series prediction as well as discover and prove new results in mathematics, and do so better than any other machine. The notion of a universally optimal machine is useful in the author's view since it allows the construction of an `intelligence order relation' on the ""policies"" of a machine. A policy is thought of as a program that takes information and delivers it to the environment. A policy p is `more intelligent' than a policy p' if p delivers a higher expected reward than p'.

The author is aware that his constructions need justification from current practices in AI if they are to be useful. He therefore gives several examples dealing with game playing, sequence prediction, function minimization, and reinforcement and supervised learning as evidence of the power of his approach. These examples are all interesting in the abstract, but if his approach is to be fruitful in practice it is imperative that he give explicit recommendations on how to construct a policy that would allow a machine to be as universal and optimal (realistically) as he defines it (formally) in the book. Even more problematic though would be the awesome task of checking (proving) whether a policy is indeed universally optimal. This might be even more difficult than the actual construction of the policy itself.",19
Robert Jones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Universal Artificial Intelligence: Sequential Decisions Based On Algorithmic Probability,Axiomatic Artificial Intelligence Theories,"Hutter's book is the most recent attempt to put artificial intelligence on a firm mathematical footing. (For an earlier effort see, for instance,

Theory of Problem Solving: An Approach to Artificial Intelligence, Ranan Banerji, Elsevier, 1969) If successful, such a foundation would permit us to elaborate and explore intelligence by applying the formal methods of mathematics (e.g., theorem proving).

Hutter starts from Werbos' definition of intelligence: ""a system to handle all of the calculations from crude inputs through to overt actions in an adaptive way so as to maximize some measure of performance over time"" which seems reasonable. (P. J. Werbos, IEEE Trans. Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 1987, pg 7)

Finding all of the proper axioms for such a mathematical theory of intelligence is still an open and difficult problem, however. Hutter places great stock in Occam's razor. But there is experimental evidence that Occam's razor is incorrect. (The Myth of Simplicity, M. Bunge, Prentice-Hall, 1963) See also, Machine Learning, Tom Mitchell, McGraw-Hill, 1997, pg 65-66. Rather than saying that nature IS simple I believe that it is more correct to say that we are forced to approximate nature with simple models because ""our"" (both human and AI) memory and processing power is limited.

I am also unsure that we should assume a scalar utility. In Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (Princeton U. Press, 1944, pg 19-20) von Neumann and Morgenstern said: ""We have conceded that one may doubt whether a person can always decide which of two alternatives...he prefers...It leads to what may be described as a many-dimensional vector concept of utility."" Vector utility (value pluralism) has been employed in AI in my Asa H system (Trans. Kansas Academy of Science, vol. 109, # 3/4, pg 159, 2006)

I suppose, then, that I object to the word ""Universal"" in Hutter's title.

I think that he is exploring only one kind of intelligence and that there are others.",5
DaleO,3.0 out of 5 stars,A Simple Introduction to DATA SCIENCE,"An acceptable primer for business readers, I guess","As a practicing statistician/data analyst, this is an area that I would like to know more about. The book gives a high level business overview, though it was thin on details that would appeal to a practising ""data scientist"". That seems to be the current phrase for people that work in the intersection of statistical analysis, data processing, business intelligence and that sort of thing.

Like much business writing, it seemed to me to be a combination of useful information, tub-thumping, cheer leading and buzzword scattering. I went to an IBM conference on ""big data"" a few years ago, that left me with the same impression. I suppose one can't expect much more than that from a fairly short book, or a one day conference. For example, you learn something about at thing called Hadoop, but not much about how it works in any technical sense. That was my impression, anyway.

Most data structures have rigorous (college-level-worthy) proofs for complexity and performance. These proofs are typically required of a student in a graduate level course, and thus, this book could be used for a graduate-level text. Because of this however, some may find this book a little daunting, especially if you just need an introduction to the topic.
The C++ code samples use templates so that the data structures can be generalized and used for any type. Therefore, the C++ code is very reusable.

wiredweird,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reasoning about Uncertainty (MIT Press),Deep look at the logic of uncertainty,"If you're completely at home with first-order logic and with probability, you're may be ready to extend some of those ideas. This book examines a range of topics that push logic and probability into wider, more interesting areas.

After a brief introduction, Halpern introduces upper and lower probabilities representing partial knowledge, and other measures representing belief, plausibility, possibility, and necessity. These are built up in a rigorous way, but with plenty of physical significance at each step - these aren't just axiomatic systems put together for their inherent elegance. The next few chapters build up a logical sequence of constructs around these measures, including independence, conditioning, and expectation. I expected to see confidence intervals generalized into these terms, but Halpern may have considered those to be exercises for the reader.

From these pieces, Halpern builds frameworks for real-world decision making. This includes the ability update knowledge (and ignorance) in the presence of new facts. It also includes modal logics, based on the variability of ""truth"" according to the time at which an assertion is made or the person by whom it it made, and ""counterfactuals"" that reason about events that could have occurred but didn't. And, whenever Halpern presents a new approach, he's also careful to point out where its weaknesses are.

This isn't for beginners, by any means. The successful reader is flexible about the axioms to use in an analytic system, and is able and willing to follow along with dense logical notation. One should not expect this to cover the whole world of soft logics - traditional fuzziness gets only brief mention, for example. The best parts of this presentation extend familiar probabilistic terms (such as expectation) well beyond their original frameworks, creating a more unified view of various belief measures than I've seen elsewhere. If you have a serious interest in soft logic, formal reasoning, and mathematical tools for AI, I recommend this book very highly.

Palle E T Jorgensen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Information and Randomness: An Algorithmic Perspective (Texts in Theoretical Computer Science. An EATCS Series),Classical ideas with modern use.,"I stumbled over this (lovely) book a little by accident. As I kept reading, my enthusiasm for the book gradually increased. While the book is addressed perhaps more to students in computation and in CS, it is very attractive also as a text to be used in mainstream mathematics, and in probability theory.

It begins with a new look at the classical Kolmogorov construction of measures on infinite product spaces, and asks for explicit ways of labeling them with a class of certain concrete numerical functions. Then it moves onto noiseless coding theory (from communications science), but it stays rooted firmly in classical ideas from Shannon-Kolmogorov communication and information theory.

It is indeed pleasing to see that God still plays dice, not only in quantum theory, but also in such classical areas of math as in number theory.

From the foreword: ""...putting Shannon's information theory and Turing's computability theory into a cocktail shaker, and shaking vigorously...""

The book is a second edition 2002, with a number of attractive additions to the first edition from 1994. It will likely work equally well in a course, as for self-study.

The main portion in the book focuses on classical and modern topics in computability, and its connections to randomness; covering concrete halting problems, chaos, cellular automata, algorithms, and their complexity.

Robert Beveridge,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Calculated Bets: Computers, Gambling, and Mathematical Modeling to Win (Outlooks)","You want this, even if you don't know you want this.","Steven Skeina, Calculated Bets (Cambridge University Press, 2001)

The first thing you need to know about Calculated Bets is that it is, by far, the most readable book you will ever pick up from Cambridge University Press. One wonders, in fact, how Skeina got past the stuffiness factor that distinguishes so much academic publishing to get this book released. A distinguished university putting out a book on, for all intents and purposes, building a system to bet jai-alai? And yet, I know it exists, as I have held it in my hands and read it.

And a good read it is, too. Skeina takes a look at what may be America's most overlooked and underrated spectator sport and how he created a computer program to automatically bet on jai-alai that actually beat the game (and the book's major failing, in my opinion, is that he didn't get farther into the actual algorithms he used), and uses it as an introduction to jai-alai and an introduction to theoretical programming at the same time. It's not a book for programming junkies as, as I alluded to, you're not going to get anything even remotely resembling hard code. It's also not really a book for handicapping devotees, because while Skeina does talk briefly about the basics of the stuff he plugged into those algorithms, he's going to leave you to do all the real work. And yet, despite both of these things, I loved this book. It may just be the novelty of reading something non-fiction from a University press that actually didn't require having a dictionary next to me (I should note here that much of what I read from university presses is linguistic and literary theory translated from obscure Eastern European languages, and poetry that might as well have been written in those languages and remains untranslated). Skeina has produced an enjoyable piece of work that seems almost marketless. That is a shame, because it's a fun book, and well worth reading.",9

Sam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cocoa Design Patterns,Unlocking Cocoa Programming,"This superb book has finally unlocked Cocoa programming! Let me explain.

In most subjects we learn by acquiring a little bit of knowledge and, once that bit has been understood, we move on to the next little bit, until the bigger topic is understood. First we learn A then we learn B. Unfortunately, this method of learning does not work well with application frameworks such as Cocoa. These frameworks usually consist of a number of complex idea that are strongly interrelated. You cannot learn A then B, since A requires B and B requires A. Instead you must learn topics A..Z all at the same time! Cocoa is especially difficult for most programmers since it is based on using Objective C, and Objective C is based on Smalltalk. Smalltalk is an extremely dynamic language whose principles are significantly different than those of current popular languages. Thus, most programmers must learn zilllions of elements of the Cocoa framework and also the unusual ideas behind Objective C (Smalltalk). These are essential since Cocoa works differently than other popular frameworks and cannot be understood without understanding Objective C's dynamic approach to programming.

Up until now we have had Objective C books which help learning Objective C, and the excellent Hillegass book (Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X) which is a tutorial on Cocoa. The Hillegass book does help the reader understand many principals behind Cocoa, but it stops short of giving in depth knowledge of the design patterns that Cocoa uses. Thus when the user tries to go beyond the Hillegass book he/she is frustrated because they were not taught the full idea behind each element of Cocoa and their connections to other elements. There is not enough information for the reader to branch out to develop their own programs.

Cocoa Design Patters, on the other hand, presents, in a very professional manner, the most important Cocoa patterns, in depth, and how they are all inter-related. Furthermore, it presents details how how to use the patterns, examples of where they are used in Cocoa, and includes extremely valuable and unbiased information on the pro's and con's and pitfalls of using each pattern. Although this is certainly not tutorial/beginner information, the book is extremely well written and enjoyable to read (especially for those of us who loved Smalltalk and other dynamic languages). It is one of the best written highly technical books I have ever read (and I have been programming since 1970).

In my opinion this book will save the prospective Cocoa programmer many, many, many hours of frustration. I only wish it had been available several years ago when I first tried to learn Cocoa (I did not succeed then, but I am succeeding now).

One final note. The authors could do the Mac Developer Community, and the wider developer community, an enormous favor. In this book they demonstrate an impressive depth of knowledge about Cocoa, Objective C, the Mac development world, and the XCode tools. It would be fabulous if they were to develop a professional unbiased critique and comparison of the pro's and con's of the Objective-C/Cocoa approach to development with other framework/development environments (e.g. Microsoft's). I think this is especially important since the dynamic language approach to programming has fallen out of favor, yet I think it has many benefits that are seriously under appreciated. This document would:
Clearly show programmers the benefits of the dynamic language / Cocoa approach to programming. Perhaps it would reawaken interest in dynamic languages!
Point out the areas where Objective C/Cocoa/XCode has weakness and should be improved. This may inspire Apple to improve their development tools at a brisker pace.'
The development world has had few breakthrough improvements over the last decade or two. I think that much can be learned from Cocoa/Objective C, and I hope That Cocoa Design Patters is just the beginning of a renewal of interest in this too-long-neglected approach to software development.",82
Kocsonya,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cocoa Design Patterns,Not just for Mac programmers,"This book has Cocoa in the title, and indeed it is about Cocoa and the Mac. Many reviews emphasises how it helps you to tap into the power of Cocoa and allows you to develop better code for the Mac. I'd like to approach it from a different angle.

The book is worth reading even if you do not (exclusively) program for the Mac. The 'design patterns' in the title are more than just a 'higher-level coding standard' for the Mac. They are actually design philosophies, ways of structuring your code. Yes, they heavily utilise the dynamic nature of Objective-C but it does not mean that their relevance is restricted to that environment. Objective-C is a fairly thin layer and a small runtime on top of C, after all.

Each design pattern described in the book is a solution methodology for a software engineering problem. The authors present a problem, usually through a small example. Then they explain the 'design pattern', the solution chosen by the Cocoa developers. They then show you why that particular way of approaching the problem makes the result more robust, more flexible and easier to modify. Software reusability and maintainability are central tenets of the book. They demonstrate that while a quick-and-dirty solution might be shorter, using the given design pattern, or, if you like, adhering to a particular software development principle will save you development and maintenance time in the long run, especially for large projects.

Many of the design patterns revolve around the factoring your problem into preferably orthogonal subproblems, decompose your software into units mapped to the subproblems and the design of the interactions between those units. The book is all about minimising inter-dependencies, by keeping your interfaces clean and your units being self-contained. The design patterns are methods to achieve that goal. Whether you rely on the objects and the dynamic features of Objective-C or you achieve the same result by explicit bits of procedural code is beside the point.

You have to know at least some Objective-C and introductory level of Cocoa to be able to read the book, as all examples use those. However, what you learn from the book you can use in any software project, regardless of language and environment. If you know enough Mac-speak so that you can read the book, I recommend it, even if you are not doing any serious Mac development.

The style of the book is pleasant, the explanations are concise but they are clear and thorough. The examples are also good, they are large enough to show the practical benefit of the design pattern they demonstrate but are small enough to the reader actually reading the code and not just glazing over the listings.",7
Eric R. Dunstan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cocoa Design Patterns,"An Easy Read, Though Errors Noted","This has been a very interesting and easy read. This book covers Cocoa design patterns for Mac OS X 10.5, Leopard, as you can see on page xxiv. However, learning the design patterns of Cocoa for Leopard will greatly help your understanding of Snow Leopard and later iterations of Mac OS X. Though it would have been interesting to know of any changes to these design patterns in Snow Leopard, something you might have expected in a 2010 copyright book.

That being said, this book is very easy to read and understand, if you really want to learn Cocoa. Though the learning curve for Cocoa is steep, this book greatly simplifies that process. However, not all the code seems to have been carefully checked for errors.

For example, the terminal colon on a method name taking a parameter was often missing, as you can see on page 212:

[someControl setAction:NSSelectorFromString(@""copy"")];

The method ""copy:"" is very different from ""copy"". ""copy:"" takes a parameter while ""copy"" takes none. A colon in an Objective-C method is part of that method name and indicates a parameter to be inserted after it when invoking the method. A method that takes no parameters has no colons in its name. A method name with any number of parameters has a colon for each parameter and always ends with a colon for the last parameter. The error of leaving out the terminal colon for method names taking a parameter was common in the code in the book.

Another error I found was on page 104 where this method was shown:

- (id) performSelector:(SEL)aSelector
{
IMP methodImplementation = [self methodForSelector:aSelector];
return (*IMP)(self, aSelector);
}

IMP is a function pointer type defined on page 103 as:
typedef id (*IMP)(id self, SEL _cmd, ...);

The error is that the return statement above should be this:

return (*methodImplementation)(self, aSelector);

This error was also from not carefully reviewing the code. It may have been better to test the code before putting it in the book to make sure it compiles and works. If I were to write a book, I think I would copy the code to an IDE first, test it, and then copy it back into the software I would be using to write the book.

However, generally the code is correct, and the code errors are not that unusual for computer books. Also, the book has the right mixture of code and text, and the examples are well thought out. At one point I thought I saw an error, but it was correct. On page 332 in the method + (MYGameHighScoreManager *)sharedInstance I did not see where the static variable myInstance was declared. Then I noticed that it is declared at the top of the code listing on page 331 outside of the @implementation block. Referring to page 154, I found a similar method with the same declaration at the beginning of the method:

static MyGameHighScoreManager *myInstance = nil;

In fact, except for that line the two methods on pages 154 and 332 are identical. The difference is that the method in page 154 declares it within the method statically while the code in page 331 shows the same static declaration made outside both the @implementation and the @interface code blocks, which is the correct way to do it, given the intermixing of C and Objective-C code. Hence, learning Cocoa requires expertise in both Objective-C and C, one reason for the steep learning curve. These languages may be simple to learn, but require a lifetime to master.

Due the code errors I found and for not covering Snow Leopard, I give this book 4 stars, but for the content and the explanations I would give this book 5 stars for the author makes it very easy to read and follow. Overall, I would recommend anyone who wants to learn Cocoa or improve their understanding of it to get this book, and I am glad I bought it. It has increased my understanding and filled many holes in my knowledge of Cocoa, for there really are not many books on the subject.

However, I see on Amazon that newer books are coming out on the subject soon. But I still recommend giving this book a read just to learn the design patterns and to understand how Cocoa works and the proper way to program in it. Whether you are expert at Cocoa or a beginner, you will get a lot out of this book.",7
Ricky Hussmann,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cocoa Design Patterns,Develops a good foundational understanding,"This book is not for beginners to Cocoa. I would only recommend it folks that have a reasonable amount of experience with Cocoa / Objective-C. Don't take this the wrong way; I'm only defining the target audience. This book details the patterns at work in Cocoa's architecture. While this text may confuse those new to Obj-C or Cocoa, it provides valuable insight into Cocoa usage patterns.

Cocoa Design Patterns explains techniques commonly used throughout the Cocoa architecture (Model-View-Controller, Release/Retain Counting, Delegates, etc.), and provides concrete implementation examples in the frameworks. For each pattern it also describes the scenario that you may use it in, and the consequences, good and bad, to using the pattern. I would recommend this book to anyone after they've cut their teeth on Cocoa, after writing their first couple simple applications. This book shines light on some of the design decisions Apple made with Cocoa, and helps the reader understand how to best leverage the patterns utilized in the Cocoa frameworks.",30
Robert L. Woods,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cocoa Design Patterns,A book that can turn a hacker into a pro...a real eye opener,"While there are design pattern books available which are not based on Cocoa/Objective C, I believe this book would be valuable to readers no matter what your language of choice.

Cocoa and objective-c are simply the foundation from which examples are created. Surely there is more benefit if you're new to Cocoa and intend to use it.

Quite simply, this book is an eye opener for a hackers like myself who've fumbled along writing large programs without an architectural toolbox (other than basic data structures).

And those who read and implement the architectural strategies will almost undoubtedly improve their work's quality.

You are required to know C and have a rudimentary object-oriented programming or you might find yourself overwhelmed.

If you're like me and know C++ and OOP, and you hack your way to a finished product, you'll benefit quickly. You may struggle a little in the beginning but it'll get better, I could almost guarantee it.",2
Craig Howlett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cocoa Design Patterns,Just Plain Excellent,"This is a great book for those building their knowledge of Cocoa. Perhaps not the first book you should get when learning Cocoa, but definitely the second or third. It puts so much of the Objective-C 2.0 language and the Cocoa environment into context, which helps immensely in understanding the language. The examples, while simple are very relevant and well constructed. The writing is clear and accessible. Thinks I was really struggling to understand are now much clearer. This book is just plain excellent.",1
Innocente,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cocoa Design Patterns,Absolute Must-Read,"There are a few core books that I consider must-read books for starting Mac / iPhone developers. This is one of them.

It is especially important for current or former Language / Framework programmers to study this book, and study it hard.

Nothing is more obvious than code that has been architected by old C++ / .NET / MFC coders that do not 'get' the Cocoa Design Patterns.

Don't be one of those folks.

This applies to Java, C#, Smalltalk, C, C++, Delphi, etc coders. These Design Patterns MUST be learned, and used.",2
Max,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cocoa Design Patterns,Excellent,"An excellent book, well written and substantive. Read this before starting on that next big project (and before you find yourself in a morass of spaghetti code).

drM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cocoa Design Patterns,Agreed!!,"I agree with just about all the reviews. I think that the sentiment expressed that this is not for the total beginner is true, but this should certainly be up there in the **early** stages of one's journey into Cocoa. I have found it, and continue to find it, invaluable. It allows you to take all those pesky Hillegass challenges, and apply a much broader approach to answering them. I have found that since starting to read Buck and Yacktman, I am thinking in much broader ways about solving those challenges, which I imagine is the way **real** programmers think and which is the raison d'etre for the book. I am also finding that one need not necessarily read it sequentially....another plus. All round...great book..and essential for me.
Added after using it for a few more months. I have moved this book from **great** to **essential** I cannot heap enough praise on this book. His methodology of recreating the patterns used in Cocoa is a gem...I am thinking especially about the chapter on Controllers, where the reader can slowly develop an app that finally **IS** a controller....and most of that ""magic"" becomes quite understandable.",3

This is frustrating for many developers and leads for pro and cons Apple division based on many misconceptions. ""Cocoa Design Patterns"" is precious even for people with academic design pattern background and NeXT/OpenStep/Cocoa veterans and precious to learn how to do things the right way and understand why.

With that said, it read like a series of research papers (which, for all intents and purposes, is what it is) without drawing significant conclusions. The data is provided, with small inferences made about conclusions within each section. The book is provided at the graduate level of previous knowledge about physics and the functioning of inner ear. If you're looking for detailed data on Psychoacoustics, this is a tremendous book. If you're looking for an undergraduate ""textbook"" on psychoacoustics and what that means regarding the understanding of hearing and the microstructural anatomy of the inner ear...you may be better off with one of the other textbooks.",5
Bogdan Kosanovic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Psychoacoustics: Facts and Models (Springer Series in Information Sciences),Great book for scientists and engineers,"The third edition of this book is improved over the previous. I liked the fact that now you can listen to audio examples within the extra material that is provided for download from Springer. The CD-ROM actually is NOT included with the book, so do not make mistake to ask for replacement since you will not get the CD-ROM. You need to visit Springer web site that is printed on the front cover to download the CD-ROM material... You can then cut a CD if you wish.

Otherwise, this is one of the best books written on the general topic of psychoacoustics. Some parts may require good knowledge of Calculus and graduate level Physics for full understanding and to make use of the concepts in practice.",1
Steven Morley,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beginning Python Visualization: Crafting Visual Transformation Scripts (Books for Professionals by Professionals),Almost what I wanted it to be.,"This book really has hit a gap in the market. A lot of my use for Python requires visualizing the output and this was the first Python text I bought. Shai Vaingast has a novel approach in writing this - he starts with an example of reading data from a handheld GPS. This book teaches Python by stealth, using useful examples and offering both shortcuts and 'the proper way' to do things. It has chapters presenting the NumPy module and the SciPy module, as well as a brief introduction to the plotting library MatPlotLib.

The examples are all useful, and I've only found one that doesn't work as written in the book (because the web is fluent and the url for retrieving NASDAQ data has presumably changed). Given that the title is 'Beginning Python Visualization', I'd expected more on actually visualizing my data. Hopefully the next edition will have more of this, but the book is still really useful for someone new to Python. It's not a technical reference: this book is about learning.

Beginning Python Visualization is a great text for those new to data analysis and visualization in Python. I was left wanting more from this book though.",1
Brett Mcsweeney,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beginning Python Visualization: Crafting Visual Transformation Scripts (Books for Professionals by Professionals),What more do you need?,"Python is a fantastic scripting language with a massive set of libraries and contributed software. It is especially prolific in scientific and engineering fields. However, the very size of this domain can be daunting, and an experienced guide is virtually essential. The author is the guide that you want and this book is obviously the distillation of a tremendous amount of experience and thought on the subject.

Though I have using Python, numpy, SciPy and matplotlib (collectively, pylab) for some years this book has nevertheless been a revelation, with many great practical ideas and suggestions that I am already implementing in my work. The book is well organised, with good examples, the writing is clear and flowing - a real pleasure to read.",1
Christopher Bevis,1.0 out of 5 stars,Beginning Python Visualization: Crafting Visual Transformation Scripts (Books for Professionals by Professionals),Very Disappointing,"I was really excited to find this book, but was very disappointed when I got it. Most of the book is random trivia about Python - I don't consider parsing CSV files or displaying the Hebrew alphabet very relevant to visualization. If you need to learn Python, there are much better books for that. When this book finally does get to visualization, it only covers *extremely* basic 2d plotting and what they call image processing is less than trivial. I would certainly expect that a book on Python visualization would mention vtk ( with Python bindings ) and mayaVi. I know the title contains the word ""beginning"", but this book is a total waste of money.",20

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Algebraic Geometry in Coding Theory and Cryptography,"Clear, Concise and Comprehensive","Algebraic geometry is a beautiful subject and have found nice applications in many areas of mathematics/CS.
Coding theory and Cryptography are two such areas.

There are many great books available on each of these areas. They focus either on Coding theory, or on Cryptography.
This book however, builds on keeping algebraic geometry in the first place.
It isolates out the relevant algebraic structures needed for Coding and Cryptography and then furnish the way the application-areas use these algebraic-geometric structures.

The text is clear for most of the parts. If it lacks one thing, it is some amount of motivational discourse, and hence appears rather tarse and a bit directionless at times. What helped me at that point is to quickly glean over the theorems in a sequence and spare a moment to tie them together to get an overview. Once the overview is obtained, reading through the content is relatively painless. It is written lucidly, but some familiarity with Abstract algebra, especially Fields, extensions etc., would help a smoother reading.",3

The tutorial application is very well documented and the steps are easy to follow, however it does not cover all the options available when creating pages.

Anonymous,2.0 out of 5 stars,Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World,Cursory and insubstantial,"The author spends a few pages talking about mathematical history, so the traditional quote from Abel seems appropriate: ""Learn from the masters not their pupils"". By that metric, you shouldn't read this book. It's written by a journalist who has a tenuous grasp on the subject and I don't think it's likely to advance anyone's understanding. An intro book about machine learning, which is the common thread of his anecdotes, would be a wise alternative.

It's also highly offensive that he wrote a 200 page fluffy text on the vast subject of machine learning and put icing on the cake by peppering it with advertisements for companies that he's affiliated with. At the start of chapter 2 he says ""all one needs to do is head to Y Combinator's Hackers News message board, which has grown into one of the more infuential Web sites in the world"". Not only is this completely false, he received a grant from Y Combinator for his start up, which we know because he included similarly transparent advertisements earlier in the book. Are you kidding me?

It shouldn't come as a huge surprise that someone who wrote a book called ""$20/gal..."" is more interesting in attracting attention than conveying information. But skip this one. There's no reason to encourage authors to write cash-grab drivel like this.",4
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World,As great as the historical elements are,"True to its sub-title, Automate This is chock full of history about how technology has been changed forever by the development and progressive innovation of algorithms. From the Wall Street collapse of 2008 to the composition of classical, composer inspired music with only a computer’s software program, Steiner reveals throughout the book how algorithms have turned industries on their head yet are still capable of so much more than we are ready to accept. As great as the historical elements are, be forewarned that the book is much more focused on how the industry got to where it was in 2013 than about where the industry is going from 2016 and beyond. For the reader who already knows a bit about Watson, the IBM super computer, or has read the book or seen the movie Moneyball about how baseball recruiting is far more accurate through algorithm than scout, this book might not provide enough new anecdotes or present as much predictive flair as the savvy reader would enjoy.
For the algorithm novice, Steiner gives us hope when he explains why Wall Street was altered by quants who are no longer (thankfully) flocking to that field, and so hopefully they will be able to focus instead on music production, Top 40 hit generation, baseball recruiting, professional level poker playing, medical diagnostics, human psychology, customer experience, and other many areas, which show how much our world can now be dictated by the sophisticated algorithms developed over the last fifty years. In some places, the book reads as a cautionary tale for the college student or young professional looking to find an industry that will continue to grow with human capital instead of machines (hint, it is not medical diagnostics). It also shares success stories, which might point a more experienced algorithm researcher to a unique company or individual expert that have advanced missions in automated computing.
Overall the book is written without too much technical jargon, and it has an easy ready style. At times, it has painstakingly long chapters and it does not often rely on humor to entertain. But for someone looking to learn about the algorithmic transformation of our technological world and gain a sense for how that will only continue to spread, I would recommend Steiner’s book.",1
Pedro Demo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World,Algorithms threaten humans,"Algorithms are controlling us more and more. That algorithms can do routinized tasks we already know. Now they can produce and play a symphony à la Beethoven. We are discovering that creativity entails more routines than we was expecting. In fact, all dynamics, however complex and non-linear, have linear dimensions – this is the entry for methodic formalizations. We can do that in positivist mood, reducing complexity to invariant formulae. But we can do that as methodological ability to understand a complex phenomenon by its linear approaches. It’s vey impressing that a computer can easily beat chess champions, do good music, standardize human behavior etc. There is, in the background, a hard epistemological question: the mental tendency to approach complex problems by ordering them theoretically (in logical-experimental format) (we only understand what is ordered, logic, measurable), is it a necessity, an ability, or a defect? Do we understand variation only when we discover how variation invariably varies? Algorithms may suggest it. We are more programmable than we think! Very nice book.",2
S P,2.0 out of 5 stars,Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World,Sensational,"I really enjoy the aim of this book -- to explain how algorithms play such an important role in different areas of our lives. Case studies help add context to what might otherwise be an abstract mathematical musing. But I find the average Joe-oriented approach to come with unintended consequences. The writing is simply hyperbolic. It makes each incremental advancement in automation out to be the apocalypse. Options traders are using options -- well let's pack up and call it a day! Euler started mathematics from a young age -- what a genius! What a remarkable young mind!!

The author, lacking a more meaningful approach to this subject matter, decided to dramatize it as if to catch our attention. Duly noted, and poorly received.",6
Dr. Howard B. Bandy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World,Automate This -- preparation for Automate Everything,"Christopher Steiner does an excellent job of explaining algorithms, the ""bots"" that implement them, and the areas they have been applied to.

Based on detailed interviews with people who developed them, he describes the importance they have in areas of:
finance,
speech recognition,
psychological profiling,
news reporting,
medical diagnosis,
musical composition,
intelligence gathering and interpretation,
games,
customer service,
identity theft,
corporate communications.

Automation in the financial markets is one of the major topics of the book. To give one example, his description of Thomas Peterffy's progression from knowing nothing about the financial markets, through building a robot to type orders to buy and sell stocks, to his founding of Interactive Brokers is fascinating.

He documents the diversion of engineers, mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists first into the financial industry, then out of it. He provides clear evidence that computer automation is affecting social behavior, advertising, commerce, and employment. He makes a strong case for improvement in education -- particularly in areas of mathematics and science.

I am a retired university professor of computer science. During my professional career, I have been involved in some of the areas Mr. Steiner describes, and I continue to write about methods ordinary individuals can use to create their own ""bots"" to manage their own investment accounts. Christopher Steiner has it right. He has written an excellent, entertaining, and highly readable book. If, as it appears to be the case, the future is Automate Everything, then ""Automate This"" is a good place to learn what is ahead for us all.",2
Kim Patrick Kobza,4.0 out of 5 stars,Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World,Fairly enlightening for the average reader,"This is a valuable book and worth reading for the average reader. And above all it is very timely.

It takes a potentially complex subject that affects everyday lives and simplifies it so that most readers can understand it. The other reviews may very well be technically correct in perceived deficiencies or omissions, and I am sure that other books (academic and not) have covered the same subject for various reasons. But it seems to me that this is something of an unfair criticism. I think that Steiner's audience is not the professional class in those highly studied in the commercial use of algorithms (probably a well worn road to them), but rather those who want to be at least semi-informed (that doesn't mean that we are novices just that we want to have a more general understanding of the area. It may also be that unlike the past, the time may be right for this type of book for a more general (non-scientific) audience.

I have a reasonably developed multi-disciplinary background (math, statistics, technology, law, network science etc.) and I came away from the read feeling that I learned something important that will generally affect my life. So great job for the effort!

One good point is that the trend of demand for programming jobs is rising. However, this seems obvious to most people by now, except maybe high schoolers. Actually, I think the book would have been a great read in high school, but now, maybe 60% of it is bland and really quite outdated. A lot of the companies mentioned were founded in the early 2000s, and the book does not discuss the latest in algorithm/automation breakthroughs. What's worse is that, as far as I can tell, the book does not explain detailed steps of common algorithms so that the reader can participate in thinking algorithmically, yet the book keeps using the word ""algorithm"".

This book is clearly not for someone looking to understand algorithms in technical detail, rather for someone looking to get a broad perspective on how algorithms are changing our world and affecting many aspects of our lives.

For this purpose, and just to be entertained by the stories, I highly recommend this book!

If you liked the movie ""The Social Network"", I would expect you would enjoy this book and learn something from it.

Note: there is an error in the book regarding a ""delta neutral"" trade, but I did not find that it distracted me from the overall messages in the book.",1

Brian Mchenry,5.0 out of 5 stars,Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World,Why didn't I program bots? :-),"As a computer programmer since the late 1970's, I found this book interesting and frustrating!
Interesting?
In how Lebniz (1700's) predicted binary computing centuries before the digital revolution (and as a Sir Issac Newton devotee who still believes the credit for discovery of Calculus goes to Newton, whereas the credit for making it useful for everyday usegoes to Lebniz, Steiner gives them joint credit for the discovery, but I digress...). Books by Euclid (300 BC), Fibonacci (1200's), Guass (1800's) and others were used to build algorithms to manipulate and exploit the market, to help hedge funds WIN! And interestingly are behind flash crashes (improper handling of outliers in Guassian distributions) the Credit default Obligations (CDO) debacle: Guassian copula's were used to determine relationships between two or more variables but if the variables were based on humans, and subject to human errors, it built the house of cards that came crashing down). Of course this is nothing new. He also relays the story of Rothschild in the 1800's who used carrier pidgins to bring news faster than by horseback which allowed him to corner the bond market during the Napoleonic wars of 1815 (Knowing victory happened he started the day with a selling spree which caused panic in the market (he must know something!) and then he bought all the bonds up at rock bottom pricing!). Bots are everywhere: call centers, personnel evaluations, game theory, medical care.
Frustrating?
The main purpose of the use of bots has been mainly to make money, not necessarily make for a better world: Bots eliminate jobs by taking the human element out of things, rig the system so those with the biggest, fastest, smartest bots can make billions of dollars. If you ever read the Wired article by Joy ""Why the future doesn't need us' [...] this book is a good argument for the future world where humans are no longer needed. Computer programmers become the most powerful people so we automate the programmers and then what do you have?
Of course Bots also are responsible for the elimination of millions of jobs. Does that make the world better? Depends which side of the money you are on! As a programmer who has worked his life in using algorithms in the field of highway safety with my father for over a collective 80+ years, and having been a witness and participant in the phenomenal and astounding breakthroughs in computational power and accessibility, particularly with respect to the field of highway safety, I guess it is frustrating from a selfish point of view: WHY wasn't I in the right field to make billions form my use of algorithms??!!
Of course I jest! This was a very interesting look at some very interesting and innovative utilization of mathematical theory. Watch out people, the computers are not your friends, they will soon replace YOU!!
A highly recommended read!",10
Mama Bear,2.0 out of 5 stars,Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World,Christopher Steiner=Malcolm Gladwell,"If you like books that are just a compilation of essays, then you'll love ""Automate this"". Superficially interesting and nothing more!!!",3
Kurt,2.0 out of 5 stars,Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World,Poor treatment of a great subject,"Steiner's approach to this topic is excellent, taking us through the widely acknowledged but little understood algorithms of Wall Street, to the Mathematical foundations of computer programming, and then to areas more likely to impact the lives of average readers, from commercial uses and finally to algorithms' potential uses in diagnostic medicine for both body and mind.

Unfortunately, the end result is a jumble of hyperbole, gaps in reasoning, outright plugs for certain companies, outdated examples, and just plain inaccuracies. Several readers, for instance, have commented on the confounding explanation of a delta neutral trade. I'm pretty confident that even the meatiest of the ""meatheads"" (Steiner's term) in the pit were competent enough to lock in a conversion or reversal (something that eludes Mr. Steiner). His explanation isn't just wrong, it entirely misses the concept of delta neutral, and so simultaneously denigrates both the conventional traders and the brilliance of Mr. Peterffy's arbitrage. This sad theme is repeated throughout the book. Steiner's world is one in which a handful of shining pillars of genius wade through a sea of crusty, intransigent morons, which although possessing a kernel of truth, grossly oversimplifies and thus does no justice to the push for and against the expanded use of algorithms.

I was also dismayed that although Steiner acknowledges on a number of occasions the dangers of runaway algorithms, he entirely avoids the far more subtle ethical questions of control. ""No willy-nilly tests, no gut feelings, just data in, data out"" says Steiner of a rather aggressively imagined Dr. Algorithm. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as neutral data. Which data are being used? How are they being interpreted? Who is making these decisions? Writing an algorithm for wide public use gives someone, whether it be the programmer, the owner of a music distributor, a hospital, or the government, an enormous amount of power. I feel that this book is sorely incomplete without some discussion of this.

We need straightforward, accurate, easily read books on these wonderful and terrifying tools. This just isn't one of them.",59

Contents:
Introduction
1. Wall Street, The First Domino - this chapter tells the story of Thomas Peterffy, who was apparently the major innovator in the last 40 years in algorithmic trading. The guy is now a billionaire. It's a VERY interesting story.
2. A Brief History of Man and Algorithms - This spends a lot of time discussing mathematicians of the past, and how their innovations led to
3. The Bot Top 40 - Talks about how algorithms can be used to detect which songs are likely to be hits. Some great stories.
4. The Secret Highways of Bots - The main idea of this chapter is that the SPEED of algorithms is what makes them so valuable. The majority of the chapter is spent telling the story of how two guys spent $200 million building a new communications line between Chicago and NYC so that they could shave 4 milliseconds off the amount of time it took to communicate between the two cities, which gave a HUGE advantage in algorithmic trading. The plan worked and the guys made a ton of money off it.
5. Gaming the System - Algorithms in gaming (poker, etc.)
6. Paging Dr. Bot - Gives examples of companies that are using computers to replace a LOT of the work now done by doctors.
7. Categorizing Humankind - Tells the story of how NASA used algorithms to detect which astronauts would work well together during the 1960s/70s missions, and how this same idea is now being used to create algorithms that can detect your personality over the phone and connect you with a customer service representative whose method of communication matches yours. Very interesting.
8. Wall Street Versus Silicon Valley - Talks about how Silicon Valley and Wall St. compete for talent
9. Wall Street's Loss is a Gain for the Rest of Us
10. The Future Belongs to the Algorithms and Their Creators

How I found out about the book: I preordered the book after I read the author's August 2012 piece in the Wall Street Journal (which was just an excerpt from the book).

What I like about it:
- It is written very clearly, and you can finish the book quickly. The author used to write for Forbes, and it definitely felt like I was reading a magazine article while I was reading the book.
- The book isn't very expensive, and so it seems worth the price to have an extended glimpse into this topic. I don't subscribe to magazines and newspapers at the moment because too many of the articles aren't of interest to me, and it takes time to dig through all the stuff I'm not interested in and find stuff I AM interested in. A book like this solves that problem.

Other books to check out if you like this one:
- The Autobiography of Henry Ford - Ford spends most of the book talking about his method of innovation in manufacturing the Model T, which is exactly the same kind of innovation we're seeing now with the use of computers.
- The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil - talks about how computers are becoming smarter and smarter, to the point where we'll all be biologically immortal
- A Field Guide to Genetic Programming - this is a great intro to a type of computing that is producing better-than-human results by ""evolving"" programs instead of having people make them by hand.",67
Candyman,1.0 out of 5 stars,Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World,Massive Mistake & Surface Treatment,"The book is rather breezy and wordy without much technical detail. It's really a story about algorithms for novices. It's fairly well written and interesting to read. If you don't have a technical background this is a good book. Algorithms do handle more and more of the day to day in our world so you will want to know more about it.

If that was the full review I'd probably give the book three stars. But unfortunately early on the book has an elaborate and *massively wrong* example of algorithms at work in trading.

Basically the author describes a ""delta neutral"" trade in which there is no risk but substantial profit opportunity. However the author describes a trade [sell 10,000 $75 IBM calls and buy 10,000 $75 IBM puts] that is actually a big and risky bet that the stock price will drop. It's the opposite of ""delta neutral.""

To make the point the other way if the price of IBM stock were to increase in this scenario the calls would go up in value (what you sold) and the puts would decline (what you bought) so you'd have losses that would increase as the stock price increased.

It's a little hard to pick up the book again after seeing such a major misunderstanding of what an algorithm might do. Also did nobody with a financial background read the rather lengthy section on finance and trading?

The author should at least update the Kindle edition so that it's correct. I'm assuming since it is digital that may be easier. For the author and anyone else in understanding and investing in options the bible and best book on the topic is by Larry McMillan: Options as a Strategic Investment.",31

Patch, however, had a good job done on him there were times when I was like ""that's a little off"" but all in all he had a decent job done, and can I just say that the cover is gorgeous! like brilliant!!! love it!!! I was hoping that patch would look more like how he is depicted on the front but they made him a little more lean in the book.

Peter,2.0 out of 5 stars,Holding On to Reality: The Nature of Information at the Turn of the Millennium,An alienated and awkward discussion of technology,"My name is Peter Saarloos, I am a Master's student in Philosophy and Education at the University of Utrecht, and I apologize upfront if my review offends anyone.

Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life (TCCL), Borgmann's previous work, struck a note with me. I have a weak spot for philosophers who aren't afraid to interpret the old masters in their own, free manner, without constant references to the tedious discussions that can stagnate Academia so.

In that book, Borgmann managed to communicate a vision of a meaningful life to which technology might pose a threat in a way that felt both personal and general. The latter style reminds me deeply of the great writers that truly manage to inspire with their philosophies. In the works of Plato, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and even Kant to an extend, personal frustration is molded to seamlessly fit the bigger picture and is then (often flawlessly) entwined with the revelation of a powerful, new idea. Although Borgmann's vision didn't have the size and magnitude of the great authors mentioned, it was a valuable idea nonetheless. How do we find focus in our lives, when technology and consumerism so easily diffuses our attention in the 20th/21st century? Borgmann turned not to what technology lacked, but what the classical lifestyle offered.

As one might expected, Holding On to Reality continues to grapple that question. However, TCCL mostly communicated the positive aspects of a life that had focus in the classical sense (something Borgmann seems well versed in) thus creating a clear picture of the advantages of such a life to the reader. The reader could then sense the threat of technology almost as if it were familiar to him/her already: Borgmann needed only to suggest this threat subtly and indirectly via the philosophies of (for example) Heidegger in order to invoke a sense of caution towards it.

However, in Holding On to Reality, Borgmann does the opposite: he tries to make positive claims about technology. It quickly becomes painfully obvious that this is not familiar territory to the author. So obvious, in fact, that (in me, at least) the image is invoked of an old man who does not understand the time he lives in, yet veils his complaints in intellectual pretense: arbitrary conceptual separations between the classic and the new, the physical and the digital, with few actual examples of the actual use technology help reinforce this rather depressing imagery.

For example, what follows is some of the books forwarded terminology. Natural information is supposed to represented information FROM reality, such as the color of the trees. Cultural information is supposed to be FOR reality, such as a painting of a landscape. Technological information is supposed to be information presented AS reality, such as a virtual videogame world (the authors lack of the latter is already painfully painfully apparent in his failure to discuss them thoroughly, regardless of their immediate relevance to his discussion).

But what really is the difference between cultural and technological information, and why is the latter 'technological'? Does the book A Brave New World not represent its fictional world AS reality, thus providing technological information? And isn't the videogame Papers, Please designed to be FOR reality, deriving its relevance from its representation of actual border control? Although Borgmann's book was written before the real blossoming of the videogame industry, he should've been able to discover the gems in the virtual world with minimal investigation. To a reader, Borgmann's blind antagonism towards technology seems the best explanation as to why the comparison between meaningless videogames and pulp fiction didn't strike this otherwise intelligent man.

Easy dismissal of central points is not all that is wrong with this book in my opinion, but I won't sketch problems with it that I won't discuss here; it suffices to say that a reader interested in Borgmann's argument should pick up TCCL. The one merit of the book is that it creates a conceptual framework for the discussion of fiction and a clear way to identify the superficial, but unfortunately it has nothing interesting to add to this framework that could have easily been both introduced and discussed more thoroughly in a standard, 20 page article. Holding On to Reality to me seems to target not readers who suspect the presence of a threat in technology, but people who desperately want technology to be threatening.",1
frumiousb,4.0 out of 5 stars,Holding On to Reality: The Nature of Information at the Turn of the Millennium,A dense and demanding text which raises important questions about meaning and information.,"In Holding On To Reality, Borgmann shares his perspectives and reservations about the information age as enabled by information technology. He traces the nature, philosophy and history of information by splitting the book into three sections which address natural, cultural and technological signs. If, in the beginning, signs were in the service of describing reality we are now (according to Borgmann) at a time in which information has become so divorced from physical reality that signs assert their own existence with independent validity.

Some reviewers have compared Borgmann to Thoreau (""improved means to an unimproved end"") and I believe that the comparison aptly captures the tone of the book. In his conclusion, he discusses the decline of meaning and the corresponding rise of information. He warns that while the more obvious forms of suffering decrease (in part, due to the powers of information technology) there is a corresponsing rise in a more insidious kind of suffering. He characterizes this suffering as the ""dilation and attenenuation they suffer when the moral gravity and material density of things is overlaid by the lightness of information.""

Holding On To Reality is a complex book. It deserves time and sustained attention from a reader, even if he or she does not share its cultural conservatism. I found myself willing to follow the arguments, but believe that a number of the most important conclusions rest on untested and unexplored nostalgia. Even disagreeing with the book, however, does not detract from its accomplishment or its ability to provoke thought and begin an important internal dialogue.

One thing that I missed was a selected bibliography. The notes mention a wide variety of sources for further reading and it would have been useful to have a view on which Borgmann would recommend for going further in the various topics which he raised.

I would recommend this book for a wide variety of readers. It should appeal to people interested in the philosophy or history of meaning and information. Please be aware that it is not an introductory text and is both dense and demanding. This is not a book that can be skimmed or in which chapters can easily be skipped.",1
Robert Morris,5.0 out of 5 stars,Holding On to Reality: The Nature of Information at the Turn of the Millennium,Now More Than Ever Before,"Albert Borgmann examines ""the nature of information at the turn of the millennium."" In his Introduction, he examines Information vs. Reality. He then makes several distinctions which serve to organize the book into three separate but related parts: Natural Information: Information about Reality, Cultural Information: Information for Reality, and Technological Information: Information as Reality
What is Borgmann's ultimate objective? In his own words, ""we need both a theory and an ethics of information -- a theory to illuminate the structure of information and an ethics to get the moral of its development."" To achieve this objective, he creates a frame of reference within which to understand the evolution of ""information"" from primeval times when it served to disclose distant reality until now when it frequently seems to have a reality wholly apart from the actual world.
The importance of Holding On to Reality is perhaps most evident in its Conclusion when Borgmann invites his reader to reflect upon ""The Lightness of Being"" and ""Adjusting the Balance"" while hiking with him across his beloved Montana. Obviously, Borgmann struggles to hold on to the reality of his own world. With passion as well as eloquence and erudition, he inspires his readers to do so with theirs.",18
Mary,5.0 out of 5 stars,Holding On to Reality: The Nature of Information at the Turn of the Millennium,Fully grounded philosophy,"Borgmann is a professor of philosophy at a university in Montana. This is an important point for several reasons: his use of his immediate surroundings to illustrate his theory of communication and his ability to tie that theory to his field of academic philosophy. While keeping his analysis of communication theory close to the history of communication, Borgmann weaves his story into a cogent read of contemporary issues in communication based on his foundation as a ""realist."" He manages to escape embracing a social contstructionist stance, but only barely. For his view of reality fits nicely with both a realist and a constructionist view. This is an amazing accomplishment. For those interested in the practical: his explanation of writing and structure are not to be missed. In this chapter he offers a way to think of the digital-ness of our past, present, and future via the use of information as a whole thing with a context and information as ""reality...structured all the way down, and at the bottom...composed of a small number of meaningless, but well-defined elements."" (p. 61)",10
Magdy Saeb,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cryptographic Engineering,Cryptography: An engineer's point of view,"Working in the area of cryptography, one encounters two distinct schools of thinking. The first school is conducted by mathematicians who are usually interested in cryptographic theory and cryptographic algorithms. The implementation of these algorithms is of a secondary importance to this school of thinking style. Attack on an algorithm, as viewed by this school, is anything that breaks the algorithm faster than brute force even if this attack in some cases is totally impractical. One can call this type of attacks ""mathematical attacks."" The second school of thought, usually adopted by engineers, considers that an attack is successful if it is practical or at least will be practical in the foreseen future. Usually engineers are busy implementing algorithms using high-level programming languages such as C language or hardware description languages such as VHDL or Verilog languages. Their aim is to provide software and hardware implementations of a certain cryptographic algorithm. They are also thinking of probable side-channel attacks and other implementation-dependent attacks. Some controversy may arise between these two schools of thinking styles. The definition of an attack varies widely between a mathematician's and an engineer's perspectives.

The text provides an attempt to cover the theory and practice of cryptography from an engineering point of view. It includes ASIC and FPGA hardware cryptographic designs, a section on implementation of Random Number Generators, a discussion on known side-channel attacks and a section on public key cryptography.

This is one-of-a kind textbook that represents an early introduction to the subject of cryptographic engineering. Certainly, the material included can help practicing engineers and advanced students in this important area of research. The material introduced is based on research papers and has not matured enough to be taught in undergraduate classes. One of the reasons is that the set of end-of-chapter problems and exercises is incomplete. Moreover, some editorial effort is required for future editions. As an example in section 1.1: the author uses the phrase ""She is also interested in..."" to refer either to a cryptographic engineer or cryptographic systems.

In general, ""Cryptographic Engineering"" is a long-awaited text that is suitable for hardware and software engineers who are mainly interested in building secure systems rather than analyzing them.",2

Andrew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through Data Structures,The best Java textbook. Good for beginners.,"If you're new to programming and are considering which book to buy, it is essential to consider that many good books (such as Head First Java, Core Java, Just Java, and The Java Tutorial) are meant for experienced programmers who need insight into Java's more complicated concepts. These aren't textbooks for students. But Tony Gaddis's books are, and this book is no exception; in fact, it is the best Java textbook I have ever bought. This book is loaded with examples, exercises, case studies, and projects. It has everything from loops to linked lists, and it does not neglect GUIs by placing GUI topics to an optional section at the end of the chapter or in the last chapters of the book. This book will also serve you well as a reference book and as preparation for the SCJP certificate. I have also bought Gaddis's Starting Out with C++ From Control Structures through Objects, 5th Edition, and I am quite willing to recommend, sight unseen, any book that Gaddis writes.",12

Just note this book (August 2006) is a little dated. It uses an older version of the jdk. But the explanations and examples are right on the money.",2
Stewart,5.0 out of 5 stars,Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through Data Structures,Excellent Text,I used this book in an freshman level programming course and again in a sophomore level course. It's written really well and contains excellent example code and practice problems. The book builds programming knowledge from the ground-up by explaining concepts in ways that are easy to understand but doesn't slack on depth or content. The CD packaged inside contains every code sample in the book as well additional appendices not included in the text.

- Well Organized
- Tons of Examples
- Written using words we all can understand
- Has an Easy to see and Smooth Progression from Easy to more Complex
- Excellent Reviewing Material at the End of each Chapter

Like the linked list chapter... those are very basic linked lists. And it dosen't tell you anything about any variations such as getting the input from an external file etc. or how to process different ways of feeding the linked list with data/information. It needs to include many more different aspects. Also, I thought the codes weren't well commented. Yes, they are well commented if you know what's going on, but that's now why I'm reading this book. Basically, the book will teach you 1+1=2, but it won't teach you 1+1/4-4. Like, you know, different variations. There's too much bla bla bla in the book.

Inga Thornell,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Respectfully submitted ;),"I started reading these in 1986 and I have enjoyed them all but this one is my favorite in a long time. I like the way Grafton used Kinsey in this one. She had her make some uncharacteristically dumb decisions to put us, the readers, where we needed to be to let other character's stories unfold. I found myself yelling, ""don't go in there,"" and had to laugh, I don't remember the last time I yelled at a book.",3
Ellen Miller,3.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Is Grafton bored with Kinsey?,"I only read a few mystery series, only by women, so I don't know if the series written by men have this phenomenon, but Grafton is a good example of what I've seen with a couple of female mystery writers. Her series started off with books that were lean and economical, with engaging characters and a healthy dose of humor. By now, however, she has become overly ambitious and her writing is indulgent and the book is bloated. She started this writing from several different characters' points of view a few books ago and it served her well in a couple of books, but in ""U is for Undertow"" and this one, it just slows down the plot and serves to distract the reader from the central mystery and from the character of Kinsey. Maybe Grafton is bored with Kinsey? She hasn't evolved very much over the 20+ books, except to get more self-righteous and moralistic. Her relationships with her friends haven't evolved, either.

Anyway, as long as the characters whose points of view she is writing from are interesting, I can tolerate it, but in this book, she has one character who is dull and unsympathetic, the spoiled and wealthy housewife, Nora. I'm not sure Grafton has the skill to build a character by writing from their point of view in third person (I noticed this in a couple of the previous books), though she does a good job with Dante. Nora, however, has such a bland and boring writing style that I skipped half of her chapters. Her actions are inexplicable, partly because she is so poorly drawn as a character. I didn't like her and found her unsympathetic. I felt sorry for Dante at the end.

I also don't like the stuffy moralizing that Kinsey does. She certainly isn't averse to breaking the law and counts several law-breakers among her friends, including the character of Pinky Ford in this book. However, she excoriates the murder victim for contributing to the problem of shoplifting (yeah, like Nordstrom's is losing money) and yet likes Dante, who is the mastermind and leader of the entire shoplifting racket, whereas Audrey was just a cog in the machine. Dante was also a hood who had probably killed people and done other horrible things, but he was drawn as being a great guy. BTW, if anybody was interesting enough to write from his point of view, it was Pinky. I really liked him.

And, yeah, Grafton does go into excessive detail about every move Kinsey makes (opening doors, eating, turning on lights, etc.). Is she paid by the word, like Victor Hugo?",1
jules,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],"Pretty good read, with one jarring note","V is for Vengeance is a good, almost excellent read, but there is a piece towards the end that struck a discordant note and prevented my providing a five-star review (although I'm sure Sue will soldier on somehow).

SPOILER ALERT/SPOILER ALERT: It seemed very out of character to me for Millhone to approach Dante (the bad guy) to report that Dante's brother was narcing to a cop, albeit a bad one. Yes, the cop is corrupt and Kinsey doesn't like him, but she doesn't know the crook, either. And somehow immediately trusts him enough to know that Dante won't just go shoot the cop and rat out Kinsey. (that would kill her P.I. career, as well as risking jail time.) She also shows lots of loyalty to Pinky, who SHOT Cappi after he had left the house and everyone was safe. That seemed very out of character to me, as well as very disturbing.

Otherwise, great book. I liked the different points of view -- very refreshing.

I can't wait until ""Z"".",13
Lena Jay,3.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],"Liked some parts of it a lot, other parts, not so much!","I've been reading Kinsey Milhone books since I was in high school (I'm Kinsey's age now) and I've never missed one. And I will read all of them until the end. V is for Vengeance was not one of the strongest. Can't remember which one was the one I disliked more, R is for Ricochet or Q.

Strangely enough in this edition, I found the Kinsey segments to be the most boring. I find William to be a crazy, meddling old man, Henry was shipped off immediately in the beginning so he was totally inconsequential, and Rosie has annoyed me from book 'A'. I was far more interested to read about Dante and Nora (laughed out loud in some parts), and I appreciated the twist/link between them when it was revealed. Didn't see that one coming. But there could've been better 'meat' around their story. The first chapter was a knockout and drew me right in. Afterwards the book lost steam, and I wanted to punch Kinsey and give her two black eyes myself about midway through the book. And Kinsey has never annoyed/bored me before. Her self-righteousness about shoplifters in a store, her loyalty to Pinky and his shenanigans, her nosy insistence on getting in the middle of the whole Pinky and Cappi duel, the whole boring story with Len, and I didn't get her deal with Diana Alavarez. Did she like her wardrobe or NOT? And these are just a few things I'm listing.

I can appreciate Sue Grafton's honesty to her readers, revealing her struggle in coming up with a plot, but I shouldn't have had to say to myself: yeahhhh, Sue. Nevertheless, as I said, I will see it to the end. I still love the series and look forward to the next book.",9

BenBuddy in Cali,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],"""V"" is for a Grafton ""Victory""","Please don't start the series with ""V"". Part of the joy of the newer installments to the Alphabet series is that they are placed in a time before cell phones. Ms. Grafton is almost writing an historical novel as well as a ""Noir"" mystery from a female narrator. ""Santa Teresa"" is the fictional name for the Santa Barbara equivalent as far as setting. Those of us lucky enough to have been to S.B. will transfer the strange love that the most California of Edens evokes. Yes, there is wealth there, but it is contained within a small town that has outgrown its ""britches"". Kinsey, the protagonist, lives on the fringes and survives by her wits and is compromised by her big heart. From crime bosses to loser thieves, we are treated to a pantheon of wonderful characters from who we hear their thoughts and ambitions. This is the best example of Ms. Grafton's writing skill in this genre. I'm saving ""W"" for the airplane to France.",2
Pat in Northern Utah,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Another good one from Sue,"Just some disjointed observations, since the plot lines have been thoroughly discussed by now.

I was glad to see Sue and Kinsey again (I've read the whole series, most twice); it always seems too long between letters. Unlike some others, I was glad to see it's a hefty book; I breezed through the earlier ones much too quickly. Kinsey's wry observations about so many things are still sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. Again, I was relieved that she had a chance to wear her all-purpose black dress, while eating a Quarter-Pounder no less.

I mostly liked the introduced characters, most of whom were not obviously all good or all evil. I'm an HBO junkie and appreciate its ambiguous characters - think The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire, and Deadwood. Dante would have fit right in.

I appreciate Grafton's willingness, after so many of these books, to keep researching new subjects. The world of ""professional"" shoplifting was an interesting revelation.

In a book of this length, I thought some things were missing. Some here were glad to dispense with Kinsey's on-again, off-again budding relationship with her birth family, but not I; this whole thing is largely responsible for Kinsey being who she is and I want to see how it turns out. Henry and his siblings (mostly ""The Sibs"" playing to Henry, the straight man) in the past have been the comic relief; since Henry was back east visiting the rest of them, we were not treated to their antics (Kinsey's serving as a bridesmaid to Rosie and William in an earlier installment comes to mind). And, I'd hate to think that Kinsey's sparse love life is actually over at age thirty-eight; not even a spark in this one except for a few comments about Cheney.

Did I detect a nod from Grafton to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series in William's obsession with ""viewings"" a la Grandma Mazur? (William was better behaved, though.)

In reading mysteries or crime novels I always evaluate whether the various plot twists or devices are believable. Mostly I bought what was happening, with a few exceptions. I found the ending somewhat of an eye-roll, but it made me happy.

All in all, I'm looking forward to W.",8
Juanita Bradstreet,3.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Good Read,"Sue Grafton made sure her readers had a strong, well paced plot and interesting developed characters to follow. The story has many different points of views as the characters are introduced such as: a man who bereft at the loss of his fiancée wants answers, a straying husband who plays by his own rules, a dirty cop who believes he’ll never get caught, a wife whose life is about to burst wide open and apparently at the very center of all the webs, a threatening gangster and a professional shoplifting ring brings it all together but however, this story has some faults. The story was a little confusing at times but since I have been following Grafton’s writing I adjusted to the cons and followed it to the end. Overall it was still interesting.<br/><br/>The book begins from the perspective of a white-collar guy, Phillip from a rich family background who has a gambling problem. His family cuts him off and he goes to a loan-shark for money and than he can’t pay the loan back. His scene and character is left behind and the story then continues to bounce around from other scenes and various characters. The story moves on to Kinsey Millhone, the investigator of the series who is celebrating her thirty-eighth birthday, shopping at the mall and catches a couple of women shoplifting. The women separate and leave in different directions so Kinsey shadows one of them and then reports it to a clerk in the store. I’ll advance the story ahead a little…. all Kinsey got for her birthday at the mall was two black eyes and a broken nose….nabbing a shoplifter sometimes isn’t easy…..Plus, finding out a day later that the same shoplifter jumped off a bridge!!<br/><br/>Of course, Kinsey must investigate and it just so happens she is hired and later fired by the husband of the somewhat suicide victim. Adding spice to the story Grafton introduces another shady character named, “Pinky”, who Kinsey hesitantly tries to help out on an issue with a local pawnshop that Pinky visits often and somehow this issue, also becomes affiliated to the loan-shark business. In the end all the sub-plots, issues, murders, crimes, shoplifting ring, are all linked to the one and only King-pin Mafia, Dante…<br/><br/>The two things I missed in this book was that Sue Grafton excused Henry, Kinsey Millhone’s landlord/ friend, and Kinsey new found family out of the picture at the beginning of the book. Her new found family was just introduced to the series a couple of books back so I expected they were going to be a new twist to her series. Maybe she has something planned for them when this series ends…..",1
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],V is for Vengeance (Kinsey Millhone Book 22),"This book was my favorite so far. It started with characters seemingly totally unrelated. A young man who was a compulsive gambler. A loan shark gangster, a shoplifting ring. Another character a rich socialite with a cheating husband. The ex-con who needs a loan from Kinsey. She reported that she saw a woman shop lifting. The next thing she know she hired by the shoplifters' s fiancee to prove that she didn't kill herself and the police falsely accused her this crime. Unfortunately Kinsey not only proved she didn't take her life but she was guilty as charged but had criminal past and had served time in the past. With all these characters with seemingly nothing to connect with each other but the pieces fit together. This was very interesting to read I couldn't hardly put it down.",2
Bearwife,3.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Incompletely informative and morally dissatisfying,"I am still not tired of Kinsey although we are nearing the end of the alphabet. But I didn't like this book much compared with many others, for the following reasons. First, Grafton tells us a lot about shoplifters, the bigger networks into which they feed, and the damage these do to retail stores and their consumers, which I found fascinating, but she never closes the loop with an explanation of how (if at all) the legal system investigates and deals with stolen good networks. This left me feeling I got about half of an interesting story, particularly since the climax of the book is a warehouse raid which gets virtually no followup. Secondly, and more seriously, I really did not like the whitewashing Grafton gives her main villain, a loan shark and king of the shoplifting/stolen good enterprise she profiles, or the very implausible ""romance"" of his involvement with a woman who he was directly responsible for deeply victimizing. (I must add that this woman is one of the least sympathetic, self involved characters to show up in Grafton's books. I sure didn't buy her as someone capable of truly loving anyone.) There's a weird cognitive dissonance in this book -- Kinsey hates thieves, but not the people who direct their thieving? Enforcers but not the folks they work for? Anyway, those are the reasons I found this book a somewhat disappointing entry in the Kinsey series.",1
Kindle Cus,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],I would never miss a Kinsey Millhone mystery,"My taste usually runs to James Joyce and Shakespeare, but I read anything that is well written.

If you have never read any of this series, start with A Is For Alibi. My favorites are B Is For Burglar and O Is For Outlaw.

Anonymous,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],"Thank you, Sue Grafton","I love the delight of learning that there is a new Sue Grafton Kinsey Milhone ""alphabet"" mystery out. I love knowing that I have the new book on my shelf waiting for the moment when I can begin it. I love sitting down, opening the latest Kinsey Milhone mystery. It harkens to childhood when the new Nancy Drew or Trixie Belden came out and you knew you were in for a great day of escapist, fun reading! Some have been better than others, but I think that may be in part because the series is familiar now, rather than the ""latest new thing""; still, it is that familiarity that also brings that delicious anticipation. This particular book, ""V is for Vengeance"" was a good read. As other readers have pointed out, Kinsey seems more solitary than usual in this one and there are several seemingly disparate sub-plots with a number of superficially developed characters, but even with weaknesses, it is still great fun to let yourself fall into Kinsey's world for a while. I love the hard-boiled female P.I. genre that Grafton and Paretsky have advanced and Kinsey's is more of the Phillip Marlow style with the added spice of wry humor, sarcasm and sharp observations. Although the ""Pinky"" character and his relationship with Kinsey played a somewhat more central role in ""V..."", I thought the character of Pinky was the least developed and least interesting - yet we were supposed to accept his great significance to Kinsey; I didn't think the intensity of her involvement with him was well supported in the development of that character. Overall,I just feel grateful to Sue Grafton for her ability and willingness to give us these little gifts every so often and if some of the ""gifts"" are better than others, they are still such delightful fun. Will she be considered the Raymond Chandler or Agatha Christie of this era? That may be revealed by readers' interest in re-reading her books over time, as many have with Chandler or Christie, and others. I have been thinking about going back and re-reading ""A is for Alibi"" so maybe there's an answer in that....",5

I still have no idea what the book is about or why I should care. Anytime the introduction contains far more description about trivial details than dialogue designed to engage the reader, it drags down the story.

Marcia Richards,3.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Gotta love Kinsey!,"I've been a fan of Sue Grafton's alphabet series from the beginning and have read A-V, so far. Ms. Grafton is a master at keeping track of her characters' personal issues and characteristics. The volume of notes must be mind-boggling.

In this book, Kinsey Millhone, P.I. is witness to a shoplifting crime. She notifies security and the perpetrator is arrested. From that point, Kinsey can smell something bigger that needs investigation. She uncovers an organized shoplifting ring.

While she's involved in the details of this investigation, another series of related crimes are committed. When this becomes clear to Kinsey, she finds her safety in danger, celebrates her 38th birthday with two black eyes and a broken nose, and is also missing her landlord who is life a father to her. Life is getting more complicated and a little scary. Kinsey toughs it out and successfully ferrets out the connection between all the crimes. She's on a wild ride and we ride right along with her.

Even though this is a series, each novel can stand alone since they each include some backstory so, the reader never feels lost.",1
Patricia Hinds,3.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Nearing the omega end,"As Grafton heads toward that Z book, I find I'm OK with that. I don't know if it is I or the format, but I'm over it. Toward the end of the book, I couldn't put it down but that was the only point at which I was fully engaged in this story. Going from one character to another with his/her own story ( which of course would come together in the end) was distracting and I continually find myself confused as to where we are in time. Kinsey is telling the story as if it were in the past in the beginning, but as you go along, it feels like a current narrative. As in the other books, because of this, I find I am frustrated that she lacks a mobile phone and the internet! Kinsey will continue to be my light escape reading, but this is another example of how difficult it is to keep readers' engaged in long series unless the characters progress in some way.",1

This is the 22nd Kinsey story, and she's 38. I understand this series are ""period"" pieces, but I guess I'm just getting tired and frustrated with her running to the library or stopping at a phone booth. Nothing changes, and when the stories are not top notch, that gets boring. Time for an older Kinsey, with a computer, cell phone and some gray hairs.",2
Winebutler,2.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],"V IS FOR ""VERY DIFFERENT""","I have read every Kinsey Mystery and as always was looking forward to the latest. I must say I was disappointed. Other than the department store incident there is not the usual plot progression moving through Kinsey's every day life. Too much time spent on mindless descriptive character development put me to sleep as I waded through page after page trying to wait for something to happen. So we had some shoplifters, the usual restaurant visit with bad wine. and then.........
After about 100 pages I gave up very disappointed. Will I go back to it? maybe but it will have to pick up fast when I do or it will get banished into the archives on my Kindle. Something was definitely wrong with the writing style and plot development that made past issues a joy and this, to me, a complete bore. And at the higher prices being charged not worth the spending.
Just FYI - It is now January 2013 and I still have not gone back to it.",3
Loves2Read,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Another Nail-Biter from Grafton!,"""V"" is the latest in the Kinsey Millhone Mystery Series written by Sue Grafton. Grafton had me from the first book, A is for Alibi, when Kinsey pulled a ""little black dress"" out of the back of her car. It was indestructible, didn't wrinkle and was always just the right thing to wear for any occasion. Since Kinsey cuts her own hair with blunt scissors and still looks good I take this dress with a grain of salt, but I like the idea that one like it might be out there and I always keep an eye open. Millhone, a loner with lots of attitude, doesn't mind getting into sticky situations or trouble when she is on a case. You know when she gets out the lock picks that she is going to go places, follow people, and do things that are going to make for tense reading. ""V"" is no exception.

It begins with a young man with a gambling problem, moves on to nicely-dressed women shoplifting at an upscale department store and then to a beautiful housewife with a cheating husband. Throw in a dirty cop, a likeable ex-con, and a little bit of organized crime and you have the perfect mix for murder and mystery. Maybe a little slow at first, but have patience because soon lives will start to collide--straight into Kinsey Millhone. Readers of Grafton will enjoy this book. It has bad guys and good guys and most of the time you can't tell the difference. If you are new to the series, you will want to start with ""A"" and enjoy the whole alphabet of detecting adventures.

AZmoosie,2.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],No page turner...,"In my humble opinion, `V' is for Veer, as in veer away from this one.

Like others who have provided low ratings, I too was greatly disappointed. After the long dry spell Sue Grafton created V, and with much anticipation, I dove right in. Having already read all of her other alphabet novels, I fully expected to enjoy another relaxing and entertaining experience; it never materialized.

From the very beginning this novel was disjointed, loosely woven, and disappointingly boring. Character and story line development were weak, taking far too long to evolve into something of interest. I found myself repeatedly skipping over large sections of needlessly protracted scene, locale, and/or character background descriptions. Those passages struck me as fill, without which this edition of the alphabet trail would merely be a very short, uninteresting story.

How many more novels will it take before Kinsey matures, asserts herself, and finally demands decent wine with her lousy meals? She lives in a state which is widely considered the U.S. wine capital, yet she repeatedly whines (no pun) about ""bad wine"". I'm so sick of that phrase that I crave a cold beer!",2
Donotstalk,1.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Awful,"Did you know that Kinsey drives a grabber blue mustang, and feels as though it might be conspicuous? I feel like this wasn't mentioned enough. It's like the author was getting a kickback from the manufacturer, she repeated it so much.",2
Renee,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Not as Memorable as Her Other Books,"This is not one of the best Kinsey Millhone Mysteries that Grafton has written; however, it was still a good read. The biggest problem with this book was Kinsey's absolute lack of tolerance for a shoplifter and yet her great tolerance of the mobster who was behind the entire enterprise: not standard Kinsey behavior and it struck a dissonant chord. In fact, Kinsey isn't highlighted nearly enough in this novel. Henry, a staple in these novels, was also sadly missing. The writing itself seemed slightly different from Grafton's other Millhone Mysteries.

Having said that, without a doubt this book is still a good read and has a good plot with several twists and turns that make it interesting. The book begins with a mob murder and the reader, if patient, is led down a winding path of other crimes until they all come together at the end of the book.

If there was a 4.5 start rating, that would be what this book would receive. Hopefully Grafton will concentrate more on Kinsey in the next novel (due out December 2013)and perhaps have her interact a bit more with the technology that was around in 1988-1989, otherwise she might as well just call it W is for Whatever.",2
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Another great Kinsey Millforne tale!,"The only thing I do not like about this book is that it is one step closer to being the end of this series - at least I suppose it will be the end. The alphabet ends with 'Z'. Kinsey Millhorne is such a fun character. She is so bright and resourceful. And she is like everyone - flawed in some ways. I love the fact that there multiple story lines, always keeping the reader guessing.",1
Erin Dinneen,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Still crazy after all these years,"It is hard enough to maintain a fresh characterization after all these years, but Kinsey Millhone is alive and well...just back in the eighties. I pretty much sped through all these books, finally slowing at Q. I picked up V, not remembering where I left off, and I was surprised to be just as caught up as I had been several years ago, the format on this varied; I almost thought someone else was writing the passages about Nora and Dante. I liked the change, and think the book is fresh and engaging.",1
arkgirllawyer,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],still at the top of her game,"Unlike many authors writing long series (Janet Evanovich & Stephanie Plum, Martha Grimes & Richard Jury, for example), Sue Grafton is still writing great books, with credible development for her detective, Kinsey Milhone; interesting, believable characters; and good plotting. This story is enhanced by third-person narratives of characters with no discernible (until the appropriate time) relationship to the plot. I subtract a star for (1) Kinsey's wreckless stupidity in the face of obvious danger (unfortunately shared by pretty much every detective/heroine lately) and (2) a pretty unbelivable point of epilogue. Still, a great read.",7
Nash Black,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Shopping Disaster,"V IS FOR VENGEANCE by Sue Grafton finds Kinsey Millhone shopping in Nordstoum's for some much needed underware. Shopping is not Kinsey's best skill and her attention soon drifts to the other shopers. Two women are chatting like old friends when one slips some sale merchandise into her bag, while the other goes to the ladies room.
Kinsey reports the incident and observes the store authorities apprehend the first woman. She scouts around and follows the second woman to the parking garage where the woman tries to run her down before escaping. A barked shin and skinned hand find Kinsey nursing battle wounds until she picks up the morning paper and learns the first woman has committed suicide.
Then in true Grafton fashion things get worse for Kinsey as people she'd just as soon forget enter her life to convince her she didn't see what she thought she'd seen. Unrelated events cluster then fragment when Kinsey is hired to discover what lead to the woman's death and a journalist demands the inside details for her story.
At times V IS FOR VENGENCE moves a little slow as new characters are introduced, but then the pace picks up as they contribute their aspects to a complex story line. A good read for any time.

Deena S Harper,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Good reads,"Ok, Amazon wants me to review this book, I will because I really, really like this series, but it is going to be a short, choppy
review and for the series overall because it is early in the morning, I haven't had any coffee, and I don't want to give away any of the plot for this book.
I have read A through V and am waiting for W in eager anticipation! I guess in the mean time I could re-read the whole series :)
Highly recommend this series for anyone who likes detective novels. All of the main characters are like old friends!
One of my professors used these books to introduce us to the methodology of qualitative research and that's when I became a
fan of (addicted to) the books. The main character has an effective way to analyze the data she gathers for each of her cases and it is also a very effective way to analyze qualitative research data.... that is, if you are doing that sort of thing.
You can start anywhere in the series and enjoy the books. My first book was ""H is for Homicide"" and now I have read them all!
Sooooo...get started reading...""V is for Vengeance"" is an exciting story...I know that sounds lame, but the story plot stays with you long after you are finished reading and that's what I like. Ok, I am done, finally. Respectfully yours.....",1

Joan Shulman,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],V was a remarkable jigsaw puzzle,"Contrary to what another reader felt, I found ""V is for Vengeance"" to be a fascinating thriller jigsaw puzzle created by a master mystery writer, Sue Grafton. Like all jigsaw puzzles, there seem to be many pieces totally unrelated to the whole. This mystery contains many characters who, at first seem to be unrelated to the whole picture. As the story unfolds, the pieces, remarkably, begin to fit together. Of course Kinsey Millhone, primary sleuth, after her expected knocks and bruises, is who gradually pulls it all together. Rather than going into detail, and giving you, the puzzle solver, too many clues, I will only say that the very last page contained the last piece of the jigsaw telling me what the book title really meant! Read, solve, and enjoy!

Thanks Amazon for a great read!",1
bookman,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],One of the few great series,"These are fun reads or more appropriately ""listens"" in this case. Sue Grafton mixes just the right amount of back story, superflous chatter and detail to grease the wheels of good plots who's many strands tie together nicely at the end of every tale. Her plots are really pretty good and the manner in which she unrolls them is even better. V is for Vengeance is a great listen or read.

As for the audio versions (always get the unabridged) which I thoroughly enjoy, Judy Kay (the voice of Kinsey Millhone) is Kinsey to me. She reads with just the amount of sarcasm and inflection I think Sue intended. The listen is very enjoyable. The unabridged audio cd is very good quality overall. There was a glitch in the recording but if you are following the story it will be evident and is easily overlooked. The sound is consistant and of excellent quality.

The story is very good, the quality of the recording is very good and the overall experience is great. I can hardly wait for ""W"".",2
Seattle Girl,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],I'm re-reading all the books in the series!,"This book was one of her best in the series. Ms. Grafton has a gift; not just spinning a detective tale, she crafts her characters so cannily, they become your friends and enemies. While the reader is drawn into the story, a tale of organized shop-lifting as a Mafia endeavor is skillfully woven in. The story comes together like a Swiss watch. I'm a huge fan!",1

Lan the Answer Man,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Plot forced and resolution unlikely but still a good read,"Sue Grafton gets back in form in V is for Vengeance. Grafton is a master of the first-person narration, and while she uses a larger than normal serving of third-person narration in this release it's a pleasure to watch Private Detective Kinsey Millhone bluff and blunder her way to figuring everything out.

Millhone turns 38 in this book, on May 5, 1988. She's getting a little older, but it turns out that Grafton made a smart move by keeping her series set in roughly the same years, before the internet and cell phones, with a principal figure who ages little book to book. Tentative but tough, and always in her little rented home in Santa Teresa, Millhone is rooted not just in a place but in time, and as time goes by this will make the series even more of a classic than it appears now.

Having said that, V has some faults. The plotting, though vigorous, relies on so many coincidences and unlikely relationships that it leaves the reader suspicious. More than that, the key plot turn, which I won't disclose, is so forced, and its human resolution so unlikely, it makes me think Grafton does her plotting on top of characters instead of letting the story line develop out of the characters. With its richly layered if labored plotting, perhaps Grafton is hoping V will work as a movie.

I also regret that Henry, one of Grafton's most appealing characters, plays such a small role in this volume.

Still, this is a heck of a read. We have to thank Grafton for creating one of the best continuing series in modern mysteries.

I also like that this one included several characters mentioned in previous stories.

As someone who reads a lot of mysteries, most endings are predictable and I can often tell who the murderer or villain will be, but in V is for Vengeance, there were at least a couple of plot twists that I didn't foresee.",1

The first chapter is a little different and rather confusing but it all falls into place as you read on and want to continue to the end.Kinsey Millhone is so real. I feel like I really know her.

K. D. L,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],One of the best of the series,"I like it mainly because there were a number of personable characters in it, as well as a good story; and it is told through the view-point of several others besides Kinsey.

At this point, it is like taking a trip into the past -- few computers, no cell phones, iPads or the like. Kinsey is still using her index cards to keep notes.

Kinsey is a very likeable character, as are Henry, et al., but one does get tired of hearing about her all-purpose dress and her self-shorn hair; and one of these days she'll come up empty-handed when she fishes around for change in the bottom of her purse in order to make a phone call.

David A. Appling,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Slow start but fast finish,"""V Is for Vengeance"" is a good read, with many threads which miraculously come together in the end. Much, much better than ""Undertow.""
It does start slowly and disjointedly, leaving the reader wondering if all the subplots can ever mesh, but, O esteemed reader, just be patient, you will be rewarded.
The plot was well conceived and well executed, except for an outrageous coincidence re a principal female character. Ross Macdonald, who is Grafton's muse, would not approve. (If you spot an apparent coincidence in a Lew Archer novel, it isn't.)
Four stars plus. But why, Ms. Grafton, did you choose to put Santa Barbara (""Santa Teresa"") and San Luís Obispo in the same county?",2

I feel like Kinsey is a real person with honest, true-to-life feelings. She's no ""super hero"" detective who guesses right the first time- every time. She make mistakes and wrong moves like the rest of us, which is so refreshing. It's hard not to want to jump right in and help her.

Loved this book, just like most of the others in this series and as usual, read anxiously to see where the plot would take Kinsey and how she would extricate herself this time--hated for the story to come to an end. Can't wait for ""W"" to be released. Hope Sue Grafton can continue on with Kinsey after ""Z"" is completed...Perhaps a new venue although Santa Theresa is perfect. An easy entertaining read, I recommend ""V"" Is For Vengeance to anyone who isn't really into lots of violence and mayhem.",1

Sue Grafton books just keep getting better and better. This one started out much different than the others. Kinsey wasn't even introduced until the 2nd or 3rd chapter.

Mike Nerison,2.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Good story but...,All sentences are packed with too many adjectives and adverbs.

Sue Grafton's writing makes the reader feel they are in the place where the story is happening, has enough detail to keep you there, but doesn't go overboard. No sticky-sweet 'boy-girl happily ever-after' stuff. I look forward to the next Kinsey Milhone book.",2
Frances J. Jessup,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Sue Grafton,"As always, Ms. Grafton writes a very satisfying novel. I now own all the books (I know, big whoopee), except the newest one in the series.

Smokey,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],"Still Milhone, but a Little Different...Very Good!","""V is for Vengeance"", Sue Grafton's latest Kinsey Milhone novel, is one of the best in the series. Grafton alternates chapters written from Kinsey's point of view with chapters that center on some of the other characters in the book. The technique enables readers to form their own opinion of these other characters without filtering them through Kinsey. Nice! ( Although I have nothing against a Kinsey filter.)

Kinsey herself is still stubborn, persistent, tough, and pretending to enjoy bad wine and weird Hungarian concoctions cooked up by Rosie, who owns her neighborhood bar. Her landlord, Henry, is out of town for most of the book, but Kinsey spends some time with his hypochondria, funeral-going brother, William, who is married to Rosie.

The trouble for Kinsey begins when she reports seeing a shoplifter in a department store, then nearly misses catching the shoplifter's partner. The women are more than just casual thieves, however, and what should have been a short-lived incident turns embroils Milhone in an investigation that turns dangerous. A few unexpected encounters with Pinky, the man who taught her to pick locks, also lead to much more than Milhone bargains for. Add a Mafia king, a client who can't decide if he wants to fire her, a persistent reporter, a betrayed wife who becomes involved with another man, and an old law enforcement enemy, and readersshould keep reading to find out what happens to everyone, including, of course, Kinsey.

There is darkness and irony in ""V is for Vengeance"", as in all of the series, but even so, the atmosphere is lighter and more positive than in many entries. It's still Kinsey. It's still Grafton. It's still a book that will keep readers turning pages.

Very Good!",3
Beemer,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Sue Grafton-A little darker,"The book is good, although the beginning of it makes you wonder where she is going with the story. The subject matter, from the beginning is a little darker content that her early novels. It is a little slower reading to allow you to keep all the characters straight, but, it keeps you wondering how all characters are going to interconnect.",2
Karen Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],A+ for the Most Recent Alphabet Mystery,"There's nothing I enjoy more (okay, a few things, but this isn't the place for that kind of talk) than a Kinsey Millhone mystery/crime/romance. This one had everything.

Kinsey is hired by a widower to look into the alleged suicide of his fiancé who was recently arrested for shoplifting when Kinsey caught her stuffing a lace teddy and two pair of silk pajamas in her bag at Nordstrom's. What Kinsey uncovers about the woman's past leads her to more than she ever thought and pulls the reader through a delicately woven plot of organized crime, dirty cops, blackmail, deceit, and romance.

The story opens on a spoiled college graduate, Phillip, with a penchant for gambling. Can he beat the system and pay back what he borrowed from a ""financier"" named Dante? Can he go to his parents for help?

Nora is an upscale housewife. When she discovers her husband cheating, she sets out to be prepared for the inevitable. While trying to sell an expensive ring, she meets an intriguing man. But is he a crime boss?

Dante runs his family business with an unusual moral code not common in the crime world. But, he's under investigation and it looks like they might have him this time. Will Dante throw in the towel for a married women with a wandering husband? Will he leave the family business to Cappi, his bumbling thug of a brother?

How are all these lives tied together? It's a mammoth web of intertwined lives with a full line-up of characters. Sue Grafton has outdone herself. I've loved all of the alphabet mysteries, but this one is by far my favorite.",3

Dahlin,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Sue Graffton at her best.,"I keep thinking this gal is going to run out of steam, become bored with her character, or just rest on her reputation and write whatever.

12345,3.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Millhone book,"Nothing special to review. Was an interesting story. I got a little tired of all the many descriptions of streets, etc. I like to just get on with the story because I like a fast passed book.",1
NyiNya,3.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Kinsey Hits the Wall...,"After waiting for V for such a long time, perhaps I expected too much. V is for Vengence is mediocre at best. Still, a mediocre Kinsey Milhone book is not that bad, so if you are a died in the wool fan, you won't miss it no matter what the reviews say. I know I couldn't pass it up.

The book doesn't put Kinsey in the best light. She spots a shoplifter at a department store and rushes to notify security. The shoplifter's body is found at the bottom of ""suicide bridge"" a few days later, and the dead woman's fiance hires Kinsey to find out if it was suicide or murder. The plot is more complex, but I don't want to be a spoiler. What is kind of odd is Kinsey's morphing into the Avenging Angel of department store security. She goes after the dead woman's partner (including following the teenage daughter around with absolutely no purpose and no resolution...it's like part of the book Grafton stuck in and forgot about). Even when the client fires her, she can't stop following the woman and causing trouble for innocent bystanders. Suddenly she's Police Inspector Javert, obsessed with bringing Jean Valjean to justice. It seems like a big head of steam to get up over something that's not murder or kiddy porn. Yeah, shoplifting is very bad, it costs consumers a lot of money, as we learn because Kinsey keeps harping on it and pouring out statistics, but get a grip Kins. And Get a Life.

The best parts of Grafton's books are those all-too-rare glimpses into Kinsey's personal life. There are none here. Henry, her handsome 90 year old landlord is away again, taking one of our favorite characters off the board. Rosie, who is a gifted if eccentric cook in some books and an awful one in others, is at her worst here. How does she keep the restaurant going when she serves only pigs feet and mutton heads to white suburban middle class clients? Sometimes Sue Grafton can be a bit formulaic, with her descriptions of the all white interiors of those houses in Horton Ravine where the rich ladies with the softly highlighted pagesboys live. You know, the ones with the pale grey wool trousers and the white silk blouse with sleeves rolled to the elbow, showing off the cartier tank watch. Oy already. But in this book, she departs from this script and I was surprised to find myself missing it!

There are subplots aplenty. We have police informants, blackmailers, crooked cops, and a mafioso and his mistress. He runs the shoplifting operation and while Kinsey is hell bent for leather to nail the poor little worker bees, she restrains herself when it comes to Mr. Big. Read the book (you know you will no matter what I say) and see if it doesn't seem a little farfetched to you at the end. Anyway, we get another peek at the handsome and wealthy Police Officer Cheney Phillips with his cashmere sweaters in soft browns and beiges, but he's mostly annoyed with Kinsey and there does not seem to be any spark on his side. She is still cutting her hair with the toenail clippers or whatever, so maybe that explains it. She's a grown woman in her mid 30s. The gamin look doesn't work very well past age 15. By this point, she probably looks either homeless or demented. Plus it seems she has gotten smaller in this book. In earlier novels, she was 5'6"" and weighed 118 lbs. Now She is noticably smaller...the word 'vulnerable' was bandied about. Okay she was never amazonian, but not a pipsqueak either. Is Sue Grafton hoping for Julia Roberts to do the movie? Is there going to be a movie? We also meet a lovable burgler and his Dumb Dora With a Heart of Gold ex-hooker wife, unfaithful wives and two-timing husbands, trampy secretaries, moles, family mysteries, family secrets, family murders, jealous brothers, secret passages and the kitchen sink.

V is for Vengence is supposed to give us a look into the high-tech world of global shoplifting. Well, it doesn't. We learn a little, that one booster can pick up a nice load of merchandise, that it is competitive arena and rival gangs fight for territory. There are different levels of operation, from the actual lifters to people who remove tags and sort the loot...which includes everything from drug-store brand skin care items to baby formula, as well as clothing, others who transport the stuff, and warehouses where it is bundled onto pallets and shipped worldwide. And we learn some buzzwords too. It's just not that interesting.

None of it makes this book work. I hope Ms. Grafton is not running out of steam this close to the finish line. I hope we get more of Kinsey's personal life and love life. Where is Robert Dietz, anyway. Has he forgotten Kinsey completely. Heck, at this stage I'd even take that poor sap Jonah Robb back for Kinsey's sake. I'm pretty sure she has not had a romance for at least 3, maybe 4 letters of the alphabet.

By the way, do other readers get frustrated withe the books' setting in the pre-internet/pre-cell phone world? Poor Kinsey schlepps to the library to do research, instead of googling. She needs to use pay phones when she's out on a stakeout! I'll bet there are younger readers who can't imagine living in so primitive a world.

Anyway, let's wait for the next one and hope W does not stand for Wasting our Time.",1
Priscilla D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Another winner from Grafton,"Wow! I found this the most complex page-turner so far.

Laurel-Rain Snow,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],OUR QUIRKY P. I. RETURNS IN ANOTHER ADVENTURE,"In the beginning, we meet a gambler whose fate is sealed when he fails to pay back some loan sharks.

Next, we see Kinsey Millhone again, talking about how, on her 38th birthday, she met up with a punch in the face and a broken nose. Over the next spell-binding pages of this captivating story, we come to know a lot more about the events leading up to that fist in Kinsey's face.

Like shoplifters connected to a nefarious ring of gangsters; a woman's apparent suicide; dirty cops; an unhappy wife; and a few more intriguing characters whose connections to one another gradually come to light.

I've been a big fan of all Grafton's books, and especially enjoy Kinsey, with her quirks, like peanut butter and pickle sandwiches and her fondness for a neighborhood bar that offers very strange cuisine.

But mostly I love watching her work, and how, despite the 1980s style of detecting, she still manages to put the pieces together.

I loved V is for Vengeance (Kinsey Millhone Mystery), for which I'm giving five stars. I can't wait for the next book.",2

Earl A. Myers,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Still at Her Peak,"Grafton has done it again. She has taken the rather mundane criminal activity of shoplifting and created an exciting and engrossing treatise on organized felonious behavior and mayhem. All the sinister and not-so-virtuous characters are there working their mischief. We can see some of our own flawed persona in some of the more interesting players, meaning that there can be found some good in the bad that manifests throughout this latest, well-orchestrated Kinsey Millhone episode.

Only the likes of Grafton, who has cut her teeth of this sort of police investigation, can continually put out alphabetic stories, involving the same PI, and keep the reader engaged and absorbed to their often unsatisfactory conclusions. With only four more letters to go, this reviewer does not relish the thought of not spending time with our hardnosed but lovable protagonist, Kinsey Millhone.",3

I really enjoyed V is for Vengeance. I love the transition from one book to the other, allowing dedicated readers to pick up where they left off without skipping a beat, and new readers to become fans without alot of background information. As usual, Kinsey throws herself into a case far beyond what is expected by the Client. I especially enjoyed the parallel story lines all intersecting in a very interesting way in the final chapters. The last two sentences made me smile & laugh...a great way to put down another outstanding Sue Grafton Novel. I take a much different approach to book reviews than others here. I feel that giving away too much of the storyline is a spoiler and ruins the experience for other readers.

Lisa Baker,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Kinsey just gets better and better.,"5+ Stars

It's amazing to me that Sue Grafton has been writing this series for almost 30 years. This story is just as fresh and as readable as her first.

I wont go on about the story line except to say I think it is one of her best. How refreshing to read an author who has been telling the same background story about Kinsey and it never gets old. She is one of the few long term, best selling authors who hasnt sold out.. Meaning, every book is as fresh and as exciting as the first.. Even more so as her characters have matured in the process.

I wont name names, but there are so many in her genre that churn out book after book and dont seem to care about their reading audience. Not so for Sue Grafton. She takes the time to tell a great story, so well that you actually get to know each and every new character she introduces.

I thank you as a reader for taking your time and being true to your craft.

Loved it. For those of you who have never read a Sue Grafton novel, I encourage you to do so, for those who are in the know... I think this is one of her best.",9

Delonda Hartmann,3.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Too Lonely for me,"After all this time the loneliness of the private eye is overwhelming. Kinsey has no friends except Henry. She has no pets--even a grumpy cat would be better than the nothingness of her apartment. No phone calls except for business and no visitors. Her life has no depth and a reader may be involved in the plot of the story without any involvement with the protagonist. There is something wrong with a book when the villain is the most attractive figure in the story. Dante charmed this reader, making me cheer for him as he made his illegal escape. It is almost impossible to feel anything for Kinsey and that's too bad after all these years. No wonder it took so long to write this book, it lacks heart. Taken (Elvis Cole/Joe Pike)",10
Flaura Hayes,2.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],NOT MY CUP OF TEA,"I usually like the Grafton novels. Not this one, it got too off-track.

These detective stories are well written, and always hold my interest.

rasmjs,2.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],boring,I loved her new way of introducing characters but this should have been 200 pages shorter.

Sure wasn't worth the money at the higher price.,4
Noneofyourbiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],I love our heroine!,"I have been with Ms. Millhone since A Is for Alibi, and this ""letter"" of the alphabet series shows us her continued evolution in important and completely believable ways. What motivates Kinsey? Who does she trust, and why? It's a nuanced, well-crafted mystery that kept me guessing, and the end tied everything up in very satisfying ways.

The story starts with a seemingly unrelated tale of a young, not very good poker player who makes some very bad choices. I won't spoil anything for those of you who haven't picked up the book yet, but just know that everything in this chapter will come in handy later on.

Then, when Kinsey goes on a shopping trip to Nordstrom's, the story really takes off. Not really a high-end retail kinda gal, it's purely coincidence that she's there to spot a shoplifter in action. The way she handles what she witnesses is the catalyst for all that follows.

Henry Pitts and his sibs, Rosie and her bad wine and exotic dishes, Cheyney Philips and Diana Alvarez are all here, making regular readers feel right at home. Even one of Kinsey's exhusbands, Mickey, is referenced. Yet the story is complicated and fascinating enough to stand on it's own if you're new to the series.

And it's well-written, too. Grafton not only puts together an interesting story, she tells it well, too. There's a heartbreaking passage about a coyote that stays with me.",5

Another fine piece of writing by this master!,4
Pamela A. Roster,2.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],mundane,"At best Grafton is an uneven novelist. ""V"" was too long,too many characters and sometimes down right silly.

Retirement might be a good idea. Don't get me wrong, I'll keep buying her books hoping for that earlier brillance.",2
Mary M Clark,3.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],This wasn't one of her best. In fact,"While Sue Grafton's writing skill is still sharp, the story telling this time left me with a ""ho-hum"" reaction. This wasn't one of her best. In fact, it was formulaic enough that I got the impression it was made up of leftovers from earlier stories, that just hadn't gotten used yet. The story took a REALLY long time to set up this time. Not one of my favorites - but will continue on with the alphabet - they can't all be losers!",1
Jill Meyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Extremely good return to the series.,"Ordinarily, I wouldn't have bothered to post a review of a book that has already received so many good reviews, but I was so impressed by Sue Grafton's writing in ""V is for Vengeance"" that I just had to put my two cents in!

I've read all of Grafton's alphabet books since ""A is for Alibi"". Some I've liked better than others, but I've always appreciated her tight writing style. Both characters and plots tended to be well-thought out, but for a while there she was mixing Kinsey's cases with her private life in such a way that felt ""tentative"". She'd write about Kinsey's family-of-birth and with each book go a little further in introducing an aunt or a cousin or a grandmother to the plot as she put Kinsey through the agonising mental work of ""Do I want to know these people from my past or don't I""? And, frankly, Grafton was putting her readers through the same agony. I had reached the point a few books ago that I really didn't care one way or the other. Grafton seems to have dispensed with these hangers-on and now concentrates on the Henry and his siblings and the crew at the Hungarian restaurant. Much better.

This new book is the best in the series so far. Grafton goes beyond Kinsey's cases - generally written in the first-person - and includes two other plot lines written in the third-person. It's not a common plot devise but Grafton has the writerly chops to carry it off. All her characters in this novel are fully drawn in a nuanced way that makes them seem real to the reader - or at least to THIS reader. Sometimes I felt I was reading a much more ""literary"" novel than the average series novel. And to the reviewers who complain about Grafton setting her books in the late 1980's rather than bringing them up to date? Well, this novel is Sue Grafton's to plot and write.

I would almost say that ""V is for Vengeance"" is a very mature novel. Grafton seems to have reached a new, high level with her writing. It's really good.",3
Michele Wilcox,4.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Could have been better,"First of all, this book is an easy read and for the most part, keeps the reader interested. Kinsey is an interesting character. However, I am disappointed in the level of cowardness in this character. Being an ex-cop, I would have thought she would have a bit more guts in handling the criminal element. Maybe her past experiences has made her question her own abilities and thus, become less of an edgy, courageous character.",1
LorShop,3.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Could Be Better,"""V is for Vengeance"" is a so-so read, and it could have been better. The Grafton series was cutting edge when first introduced, now it suffers from long-winded narrative about things like Rosie's cooking, Henry's family, and Kinsey's cleaning. Get on with it. Grafton is too in love with her own characters and slows down the plot as a result. In fact, the most exciting parts of the book are when Kinsey et al are NOT on the page. The two most interesting characters are the mobster and his girlfriend. Kinsey is wooden, not evolving at all, and becoming a has-been. Plus, the book suffers terribly from being set in the 80s! Sure,books are written out of our contemporary time, but, if so, the drama and characters should move the plot along, not bog it down like this one does. Well, Grafton only has W, X, Y, and Z left. My advice to the author, introduce a different, contemporary character in a new series while you finish the alphabet with Kinsey.If you're a new reader to the series, buy the A - I books from Grafton--they were the author and character at their very best.",4

We've known her for years and there has been zero growth, development, or change. And her quirks have become annoying. I almost took a dislike to her when she set out to capture the shoplifter as if she were a serial killer, and then got all preachy about it. And the tedious detail in this book is enough to make me skip sections. I would say 50pgs could easily be trimmed without losing one ounce of plot integrity. Also, it's vital that there be at least one empathetic character for the reader to give a rip about the story and I couldn't find a single one in here. The regulars are one dimensional and the new cast aren't much better. It is still a readable book and I know this is a harsh review but with Ms. Grafton's talent we have come to rely on her for better than this.",8

Each time the author switched to another character I found myself putting down the text & going away to do something else.

M. Chandler,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Worth the wait,"I have been looking forward to this book for months. While I was waiting, I downloaded most of Grafton's previous books to re-read. So, over the last six months, I have re-acquainted myself with Kinsey. This book did not disappoint me. I finished reading it this morning, and I had a smile on my face. Then I realized I will have to wait a while for the next Kinsey, and I was sad. I rate ""V"" as one of my favorties of the series (along with G is for Gumshoe and J is for Judgment.) Some of Grafton's books make me laugh out loud; this one did not. But I was engrossed by the characters, as always. I don't know what makes Sue Grafton's books so good--I just know that they are. If you haven't read the alphabet series, do it.

We also have some interesting new bad guys in this book. Grafton's plots are always well crafted, but above all, it is her delightful and varied characters, major and minor, who keep me turning pages long into the night. This is the first book I read with my new Kindle Fire, and I am grateful for the bright Kindle Fire backlighting, making it easy for me to keep reading in bed with no lights on, long after my husband is asleep.

JJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Wishing for the old type of Sue Grafton book,"My copy of this book came yesterday and I've just started reading it. I'm sure that I will enjoy it but feel that she has even more gone off her normal track by bringing in too many stories about too many people. I can't help wishing for the older, simpler type of Sue Grafton books. There is only one of her books that I did not keep in my library. That was H is for Homicide and was just ""too dark"" for my taste. Also, in T is for Trespass, again I thought the story was too dark and I did not like the telling of some of the story being from the viewpoint of other people. I prefer a simple straightforward story told in the first person by Kinsey. I only want to know what she thinks not what other characters in the book think. I've wondered where Ms Grafton will go after she reaches Z. Maybe she could start all over again with One is for ?. I just have the feeling that the simpler Kinsey stories don't challenge her anymore and she wants a longer, more complicated story with lots of characters. She may be going off the track since people who fell in love with her books fell in love with the original type of story. I want to stress that I have read all of her books several times so am qualified to comment on the gradual change in the type of stories that she tells. I hope that she will return to her original story telling since you really can't improve on it. I wonder if there are anymore old fans out there that agree with me on this.",2

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],THE REAL MYSTERY WHO WROTE V FOR VENEGENCE,"Did Sue Grafton contract Janet Evanovich as a ghost writer? Has kinsey morphed into Stephene Plum? is Santa Terresa the new burb? Hary's brother William has become Grandma Plum going regularly to funerals, Rosie is cooking suddenly inedible food concoctions and the neighborhood is full of Jersey Shore Mafia types stealing, strutting and preening and occasionally murdering. Flat writing, a convoluted plot or plots and a kinsey devoid of any of her old personality but with the mannerisms that work for character identification and to differentiate her from Stephene--Stephene has a hamster and two ""really hot boyfriends"" Kinsey has Harry, the same devotion to junk food, blue jeans, and underwear. Lots of irrelevant detail here--on streets, the highway, parking granges, and even tract housing developments to hide the lack of story or depth that characterize Sue Grafton as a writer. And it's carelessly edited. Although it's supposed to be the late 80's, 21st century terminology and technology keep creeping in. Well, at least nobody pulls out a cell phone. Janet can keep writing, as predictable and as formulaic as the Stephene Plum series has become. She has the advantage of numbers. Grafton must be looking forward to crossing that ""z"" finish line.",35

Frank Connelly,1.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],disappointed,This book was too wordy. Much more information than needed about a long list of characters.

L. Dean Murphy,5.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Kinsey Millhone is back with a vengeance!,"Following U is for Undertow, Kinsey Millhone is back with a vengeance! She gets a 38th birthday ""punch in the face and busted nose"" in May 1988. A cake would have been nice. Kinsey is a pragmatist, ""a big fan of forgiveness as long as I'm given the opportunity to get even first.""

Reluctantly shopping at an upscale retailer, Kinsey spies Audrey Vance stealing expensive silk PJs. The civic-minded P.I. discovers the woman is in cahoots with another and reports them both. Vance is arrested, while the other scofflaw nearly runs Kinsey down in the parking garage with a Mercedes. Vance is later found dead, an apparent suicide, but homicide is soon suspected.

In a parallel plot, Lorenzo Dante, Jr., known simply as Dante, is a loan shark with alleged Mafia ties. Dante has quite an inferno of illicit businesses burning --- and a red-hot romance with a powerful attorney's wife. One of those enterprises is a highly organized ring of shoplifters, whose kingpin was Audrey Vance. Vance's unsuspecting fiancé hires Kinsey to investigate what he thinks are bogus shoplifting charges, and the improbable suicide. Thrown into the mix are a corrupt cop, and a gambling addict who sells his soul to Dante.

Predictably, characters face death during the investigation, and Kinsey is pulled into the vortex. Ghosts from novels past haunt Kinsey, even likeable petty criminal Pinky Ford is instrumental in the dénouement. Vixen reporter Diana Alvarez from ""Undertow"" is a thorn in Kinsey's side but eventually proves beneficial. Heartthrob and former flame Cheney Phillips keeps readers guessing if the fire will rekindle. Unfortunately, friend and landlord Henry is away, visiting one of his ancient siblings with a broken bone.

The structurally complex plot is simplified with the help of Kinsey's index cards that are ""like the pieces of a puzzle that would fall into place once I understood what I was looking at."" That, and her intuition. ""The purpose of intuition is to warn us when the wolf arrives at the door dressed as Little Red Riding Hood.""

Any Sue Grafton novel reads like a welcomed but long-overdue letter from the iconic private eye, bringing readers up to speed with her latest escapade. The queen of Alphabet Soup-titled mysteries (who earned the title of Grand Master by Mystery Writers of America) has made a quantum leap by taking on social issues in the last few of her 22 too-realistic-to-be-fiction works.

With perpetrators identified early on, this is more of a whydunit than a whodunit, validating Grafton's title of Grand Master bestowed by her peers. While Kinsey--an average Jo--has learned to leap hurdles in her career, Sue Grafton has become an Olympic-class pole vaulter in hers. Impeccable plot, prose as rich as Wall Street, and everyone's favorite investigator make this a surefire bestseller.

V is for Vengeance (Kinsey Millhone Mystery)
--- Reviewed by L. Dean Murphy",146
Bookworm,3.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Not quite up to her usual standard but still good in parts.,"There is something bleak in the new Kinsey adventure. At 38, the detective is lonelier than ever. Maybe this is why she lets herself get involved in two apparently unconnected affairs, neither likely to bring in the big bucks. The pace is slow, at times bordering on sluggish. While she plods on, two other characters are brought in. We sense that there will ultimately be a connection, but do not care greatly. Of course, towards the end everything fits neatly - too neatly? with some highly improbable developments. To tell the truth, by that time one just wants it over and done with. Yet this is not a bad book, and a host of well loved characters make cameo appearances (though we could do with less details about Rosie's cooking).

EJBH,2.0 out of 5 stars,V is for Vengeance [Large Print],Least Favorite of Series,"I had planned and finished my necessary tasks so I could begin this book as soon as it downloaded to my Kindle after midnight Sunday. Maybe I had set my expectations too high because ""V"" is my least favorite of the series. I kept being distracted by thoughts that Kinsey could.. Google that.. use her GPS ... or use her cell phone ... etc. Nothing in the book told me this was not a present day story so I expected it to be current. Kinsey and Nancy Drew seem to be colleagues. I hope it is not two more years before ""W"" arrives!

Ashley,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Applied Algebra: Codes, Ciphers, and Discrete Algorithms","Interesting Topics, but brief explanations for each topic","I had to use this book for my applied algebra course, and a lot of the material in the book is interesting (especially the ciphers because I think of these as just being puzzles). But for many of the sections, the book gives very brief explanations/examples before the actual problems (sometime there are no examples). So there will be a page or two pages of definitions, examples, but then 20 problems that do not seem similar to what was explained in the section. If you don't have prior experience with some of the topics in the book, you will be lost since this does very little explaining. However, the book is cheap which was really nice compared to how much math books usually cost me.",2

I like the books approach on giving you enough background about middle-ware evolution that makes it easier to understand what Web Services are trying to accomplish. Given that the actual technology (implementation details) change so much in this area the books approach makes a lot of sense. I also found explanations to be concise and clear.

Advice: if you are looking for a hands-on how-to book about XML this is not the book to pick up. Otherwise, if you are looking for a good fundamentals book that will help you paint a big picture of Web Services this book is great!",9
Rob C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Web Services,Poor Quality Kindle Edition,"The quality of the Kindle version of this book is very poor. It looks as if one is reading a poor quality scan rather than rendered text. The type face is very light and jagged. Worse still, are the whitespace breaks between letters within words. It's like reading code rather than prose. Unfortunately, I didn't start reading the book until well after the seven day return policy and now I'm stuck with it but, don't you get stuck with it.

Fritzair,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Database Processing: Fundamentals, Design and Implementation (8th Edition)",Kroenke Database Processing uses a 286 chip,"I have a difficult time learning from this book. The questions he uses are very difficult to understand and often are misleading.
The answer key is missing, so understanding or checking your grasp of the material must wait until officially tested. Which is now too late, the concepts roll into each other. His vocabulary, used to describe a condition, is incredibly vast. So unnecessary. Too many definitions, not enough examples where to use the concepts.
Bashes MS and Access to excess. Nothing in the instructions how to find SQL or install it or use it, so you are forced to us Access which when you query, is broken by some of his sample SQL statements.
Finally, many examples and conditions are explained along with his terminology which he says no one uses!! But you find this out only AFTER you have read the pages involved. Seems like a waste to explain a concept you should never use or doesn't hold true. And then he tests you on those concepts.",1
E. Tischhauser,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Database Processing: Fundamentals, Design and Implementation (8th Edition)",Terrible book,"Considering that this book is the 10th edition, I would not want to see what the previous editions looked like. This book is full of mistakes, both editorial and technical.

Don't buy this book unless you absolutely have to for a class. If you do have to, look for the best price on a used book, don't bother to buy a new one, you will NOT want to keep it.

This book has some of the worst examples I have ever seen. The examples are so convoluted that there usually isn't a straight forward answer to most of the problems. This has been verified by looking in the instructors version of the book.",1
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Database Processing: Fundamentals, Design and Implementation (8th Edition)",It's actually very good...,"I find it difficult to believe that there are too many errors strewn throughout the book. Most of the examples are in basic SQL, so some tailoring might be required for it to fit your individual DBMS. Of course, you can always go to the last chapters for practical applications using proprietary software.

This leads me to remind the buyer that the book is about concepts and design, not Oracle/MySQL/Java etc etc programming. It teaches you things you might have missed if taught informally, such as database normalization and the use of various keys.

For what it claims to be, it suits the job quite well, and is very detailed in how it describes database design and common pitfalls.

Poor font choices IMHO and I found many typos as well. So not a pleasurable reading experience, as for example with Ben-Gan's books.

That said, there are some interesting and useful perspectives offered here. I downloaded the code from Davidson's site.

It downloaded in just a couple minutes to both devices and I don't have to worry about returning it cause it will return itself. I would definitely suggest trying this to all college students. I'll try to add more at the end of the semester to say how it all worked for me.

A caution of warning, make sure that you only need the book and no other online resources that sometimes come bundled with printed versions of textbooks.

MarkusG,4.0 out of 5 stars,Exodus to the Virtual World: How Online Fun Is Changing Reality,Attention migration,"The central theme of Exodus is the concept of ""attention migration"". That is: that more and more people choose to immerse themselves in synthetic worlds (Castronova's word instead of ""virtual worlds"") - MMOGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Games), like Second Life and World of Warcraft. Today they have at least 16 million registered users, and the number is increasing quickly. Also, some of these synthetic worlds function like alternate societies with their own norms of conduct, citizenships, economies, codes and policies and so on. In a information society where attention is central, the increasing attention spent on synthetic worlds will (according to Castronova) create a ""atmospeheric event""...
Castronova writes well and he discusses this social phenomenon and it's probable future impact in an interesting way. Though at times I think the discussion becomes a little repetitive, and I can't totally agree that ""real"" societies will have to become more ""fun"" and gamelike to compete with the synthetic counterparts. But it is a fascinating thought.",2
Christine S,3.0 out of 5 stars,Adobe Captivate 7: The Essentials,A Guide for changing existing slides,"To use this book, you will need to download a file with existing projects.

I was hoping for something with a little more information (""the essentials"") but really just got the ""basics"". This book will be good for young adults in school (pre-college), or perhaps for a little bit of training in business situations. I'm trying to learn as I go -- but I've used other similar software before, so this was a bit over simplified for me (probably should have tried the advanced book first).

I have not seen the advanced book, but I really don't want a book that requires me to download and adjust existing slide projects.

Noah Green,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pragmatic Version Control Using CVS,How to do it,"I've been grappling with the Concurrent Versioning System (CVS) for years. Moreover, I've been misusing it. Baffled and intimidated by its cryptic syntax and concepts, I've missed out on the power of branching and tagging, and the way these tools can be used to clearly demarcate project releases and versions. Using CVS as little more than a safer place to keep code than a local hard drive and an easier way to pass code around than FTP, I and my teams have failed to benefit from version control's true purpose. Checking code into the mainline only, we've found ourselves holding off on writing or checking in new code while a release is underway, and being forced to add new, untested code to a stable past release in order to fix a bug.

CVS's documentation has never helped matters. The free online manuals (aka ""The Fish Book"", ""The Cederqvist"", etc.) are classics and miss no detail documenting CVS's complex and option-laden commands, but say little about what exactly to do with the commands in order to run a successful software project. Other commercial CVS books essentially have been longer-form rewrites of the original manuals. And through it all, CVS's syntax has remained complex and intimidating.

Along comes Pragmatic Version Control Using CVS. With clarity, brevity, and humor, its authors show that version control can and must be the centerpiece of any development process, and they show how to make the humble, aging CVS work as that centerpiece. Taking the successful 80/20 approach, they cover only the features necessary to support the important things in software project execution: maintaining separate versions, marking releases and bug fixes, merging fixes to an old release into the latest version, and even bonus topics like managing third-party code. They take an Occam's Razor to CVS's syntax, leaving you with a small, essential slice that's easy to remember and use. Alongside this syntax, the authors suggest idioms, naming conventions, and techniques. What you end up with is the bare bones of how to run a software project. You start to feel like you're not even using CVS - that you could be using any version control system. The syntax becomes secondary and the process takes center stage.

Here is a summary of their approach: (1) Develop on the mainline; (2) Branch only from the mainline, and only when you're ready to put out a release (or experiment with some great departure from the current codebase); (3) Tag the branch when the release is done; (4) Return to the branch to fix a post-release bug; (5) Tag the branch before and after the bug fix; (6) Merge the bug fix back into the mainline; (7) Get back to work on the mainline; (8) Go home at a reasonable hour. In between all these steps, part of your team can work on the latest version while others launch or patch a release. Old work will not impede new work; new work will not pollute old work. The authors put the ""concurrent"" back into ""CVS.""

That's the undergirding of a solid development process. All you need is a tiny subset of CVS's baffling syntax to do it. The book describes the subset.

Please understand that this is not a definitive CVS reference. The authors don't document anything unrelated to the process. Armed with the common sense gained from the Pragmatic book, you can go to the original docs and find what you want.

I read this book over a year ago, and have waited until now to review it. In that time, I've successfully implemented most of its practices in the team that I lead. We can pull down the code tree of any of our past releases in an instant, fix a bug, and redeploy, all without affecting current development efforts - or having those development efforts affect the old release. There's never a question as to which version of the code we're working on. We're safer, smarter, and faster. All it took was a 175 page book, a free version control system, and a bit of open-mindedness. If you're not already doing what this book shows you how to do, start now.",6
R. Williams,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pragmatic Version Control Using CVS,A Reviewer Who is NOT a Member of the Author's Poker Pals,"Not sure what I'm missing. These books are thin in more than the physical way. This one has a few decent ideas. Actually, my big beefs with this book are:

1. Most of this information is just freely available. Look at this as a search prevention mechanism.

2. If you use a tool with great CVS support (like Eclipse 3), literally 2/3 of the book is completely superfluous.

3. If you don't use a tool w/great support, get that for free, not this, you'll end up much farther down the road.

Why not put ideas into a book like this? For instance, Vincent Massol's recent article about automating a process of publishing diffs to keep people up to date. Or looking at some of the many interesting OS addons like CVSList. This is literally just one more book that sells you something you already have ready access to.",18

Flavio Diez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Structures and Algorithms in Java,Great explanation and examples,"If you want to go deeper into data structures and algorithms whilst at the same time using python as your programming language, than this book is all you need.

There are many examples that follow the explanations to each of the most important (as well of the minor ones) data structures or algorithms. This makes it easy to understand the concepts and to apply them.

The authors often offer alternatives to the algorithms such as a in-place alternative to a algorithm that uses a help array. They also show the content in such a way that, whenever possible and appropriate, they build on top of previously presented topics, also making it easy to augment the knowledge you previously acquired.

customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Modern Coding Theory,"The more read, the more dislike","The second to worst engineering books I bought so far. The worst one is the ""Digital Transmission Engineering"" that has its trade-in values gone from close to $2 to not eligible for trade-in anymore. This Modern Coding Theory is neither close to textbook quality since it lacks progressive and rigid buildup of the ""theory"" nor close to reference book quality since its purpose is to write something ""modern"" that is still being researched (so instead of reference it is more like introduction). I bought this book because of its attractive table of content that looks like more being focused, not like the very well written ""Channel Codes"" and ""Error Control Coding"" that collect almost all recent research outcomes for modern codes most of them are useless in the real word. That said, this book does not contain and explain methods well as those in the ""Channel Codes"" and ""Error Control Coding"". Especially for LDPC, as the ""Error Control Coding"" states, virtually all practical LDPC codes are QC-LDPC. I am still looking for a good book focusing on the QC-LDPC in theory level. I am not looking for any book that can provide the optimal real world solution as even in the ""Channel Codes"" and ""Error Control Coding"" and others I have discovered that some solutions for classic codes are not good.",1
D. Bradley,1.0 out of 5 stars,Modern Coding Theory,Useful only as an additional reference book,"This book was required reading for my graduate level advanced coding topics course. My first issue with the text is its clunky notation. Expressions and equations are written in unusual fonts. Super and sub scripts appear awkward, and the authors seem to introduce their own notation for convolution. Besides the cumbersome typesetting, the book has a somewhat scatterbrained approach for organizing material.

This book is essentially about LDPC codes, almost exclusively. The book is good as a side reference, perhaps to supplement a more organized and clearly written text such as Lin & Costello, but not as an introductory text, or a text one would use for clarifying concepts. The text by Todd Moon is a far superior reference.

Overall, I do not recommend this book. I've not gotten much use out of it all semester.",18

Hyper-computation constitutes a kind of extension of standard computability theory, not restricted by Church-Turing thesis. Its aim, so we could say, is to compute the usually uncomputable. The book under review presents a good and elementary introduction to hyper-computation, its difficulties, its methods and part of its story.

Michael Tozer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The New Oil: Using Innovative Business Models to turn Data Into Profit,The Holy Grail for Data Junkies!,"This book, I believe published by Technics, the firm owned and operated by my friend and colleague, Data Modeling Rock Star, Steve Hoberman, is actually the most important Business Book about the Value of Data that I have read to date. Kindly allow me to put this is context:

Most of what we see these days relative to the now ubiquitous ""buzz word"", ""Big Data"", is focused primarily on technology:

Grid Computing
Hadoop
Pure Data
Exadata
""R""
""Netezza""
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera

You won't be burdened by such technical ""mumbo jumbo"" when reading this book. Thank God!

This amazing and important book focuses rather on Business Models to enable the Data Value Chain. Remarkable and awe inspiring examples are given from actual business usage. Companies such as Google, Amazon, Nike, and many, many others have learned how literally to flip their business models, by leveraging data. For example, Google started out as a Search Engine. It is now, of course, an advertising platform. The great company we interact when writing this review, Amazon, is another perfect example of leveraging the value of data. I simply can't emphasize enough how much I've appreciated Amazon's excellent recommendation system over the years. It's almost seemed as if Amazon could ""read my mind"". Well, they can. And that is the point of developing innovative Business Models based on understanding and then exploiting the Data Value Chain.

The title of my review is chosen with set purpose in mind. I've been a dedicated data junky ever since the lovely Glenna Colton taught us Extended Relational Analysis at the First National Bank of Chicago way back in 1984. And I've toiled, often behind the scenes, for these several decades, primarily because businesses, aside from perhaps Oracle Corporation, have not understood the intrinsic value of data, what the author calls the New Oil. This analogy is extremely important. As Oil caused a titanic paradigm shift for industry many years ago, now data stands ready to cause an even more dramatic paradigm shift. Data Architects, once treated as children, to be seen and not heard, yet now armed with the important knowledge from this ground breaking book, and armed also with their already well honed understanding of data modeling and relational database design, can boldly come to the forefront of the business roundtable. We've come a long way, Baby. Let's enjoy the ride!

Great thanks to both Author Spijker and to Mr. Steve Hoberman for delivering this gem to the reading public. It truly is the Holy Grail for Data Junkies. But is also critically important for other business executives to understand these concepts today, in order to compete successfully in our increasingly connect world. Get your copy today!

I don't know if there's a better one as my professor professed out of this one rather extensively.

Luckily I had a good professor, so the book wasn't as bad compared to if I had just read this book by itself (and I'm a math major, I can read a math book in a week and understand it!).

It has a relatively ""condensed"" writing style, even for a math book. There is little discussion as to why I should care about why a code should be treated as a linear subspace of (Z/2Z)^n. There is, come to think of it, little discussion *period*.

I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you had to for a course.",1
Christopher J. Gait,2.0 out of 5 stars,Database Performance Tuning and Optimization: Using Oracle (Springer Professional Computing),Disappointing and out of date,"I didn't really order this book expecting a practitioner's guide to Oracle. It's written by a respected and widely published academician and I was looking forward to a melding of theory and practise. All I found was a book full of filler (lots of queries and printouts when summaries would have done) that is way out of date. For a performance book published in 2003 to not even mention Statspack (while devoting a chapter to bstat/estat) tells me that the author stopped working on Oracle at 8.0 and has not caught up. I have to admit that I cannot write a thorough, page by page review of this book because it is packed up for return to Amazon (a first for me). But to give you a couple of examples of the shallow treatment of the subject in this book: the index does not list the term histogram (poor editing) and the section devoted to it does not even mention that there are problems getting the optimizer to make full use of histograms when bind variables are used (though researchers have shown that histograms are not fully ignored when using binds as has been published many times). The section on partitioning doesn't go into the advantages and drawbacks of global vs. local indexes on partitions and doesn't in fact go into any substantive treatment of partitioning options at all. This book is over-priced and under-powered. I gave it two stars instead of one simply because someone who is a student trying to transition from pure theory into practise may find the reasurring presences of familiar terminology and formatting helpful. There is some material on the mathematical foundation of the relational model that could also be helpful to the student and practitioner in the field. But if you are looking for real performance books you would be far better off looking at those from authors of the Oak Table (search for Oak Table on Google to find this), such as Tom Kyte and Jonathan Lewis.",5

I disagree with the sentiment. I think the problem is that I.T. has gone from the philosophical and the curious to something with applications, convertible to problem sets!

Yeung's contribution is thoroughly modern, beginning with Shannon and Markov through divergence and other measures. Traditional memoryless channels aren't neglected, nor is the famous Blahut and Arimoto rate distortion problem frame.

Connections are made throughout, whether to the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird, Rubin) or implicit applications of notions like divergence to genomics and ecological modeling.

Of personal interest is the strong section on network coding, arguing why additional coding is needed at intermediate nodes to maintain bandwidth optimality, despite coding at sources and for the channel.",7

In addition, using no technicality at all, all readers can learn easily. This is one of those very rare books that explains concepts so clearly that at the end of even complex algorithms you find yourself thinking "" ... I could have done this myself!"".

N/A,1.0 out of 5 stars,C++ Plus Data Structures,*NOT* an Excellent Second Semester Text!,"Like another reviewer, I used this required text in a data structures course at the University of Maryland.

Unlike the other reviewer for the University of Maryland, I very much disliked this book.
A prerequisite to this course is an introductory C++ course that uses ""Programming and Problem Solving with C++"" which Nell Dale co-authored. I found ""Programming and Problem Solving"" to be pretty good and I earned a strong 'A' in the course.
This book however was awful. Put simply, the material was too difficult to understand. My average at the end of the course would have earned me an F if the final grades hadn't been curved, which gave me a B.
Perhaps this material is too complex for a one-semester course. I am unable to make this call since I still don't understand any of it. Regardless, the book was written to teach various concepts in a one-semester course and it fails to do much else than to frustrate the student.",7

missed,4.0 out of 5 stars,We The Media,An Excellent Look At Citizens Media,"Television, print, radio, etc. has long been the bastion of traditional media. That is, until the Internet became the tool of the people, allowing us to participate in content creation in ways never before seen. The masses have become less content in being subscribers to traditional media outlets; the Internet has become one of the major tools through which citizens have taken the idea of Journalist off its high pedestal and is helping us to reshape the very nature of who makes content and why it is important.

Dan Gillmor is a journalist of both traditional and new media, and his ""Wethe Media"" is an excellent study into how citizen's media is of growing importance in today's society. Gillmor uses a variety of relatively recent cases, such as the Howard Dean candidacy, and looks closely at how these instances are proving that citizens media is maturing rapidly and its tools will become the new face of new media.

An excellent, easy to read bit of work, Gillmor has done a stellar job in the tradition of Reingold, Lessig and others in exploring and supporting the common man in the face of tradition.",3
Robert David STEELE Vivas,4.0 out of 5 stars,We The Media,"Easy to read overview, sensible, read with Trippi's book","Edited 20 Dec 07 to add links.

Joe Trippi's book, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Democracy, the Internet, and the Overthrow of Everything joins Howard Rheingold's book, Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution and Bill Moyer's collaborative book, Doing Democracy as the companions for this book--taken together, the four books provide everything any group needs to ""take back the power.""

Whereas Trippi provides a personal story that illuminates the new power that comes from combining citizen activism with Internet-enabled networking, this book focuses more on the role the Internet and blogs play in the perception and dissemination of accurate unbiased information. It is not only an elegant presentation, easy to read, with good notes and a fine seven-page listing of cool web sites, but it also provides a useful survey of past writings on this topic--with due credit to Alvin Toffler's first perception of the trend toward mass customization and the elimination of intermediaries, together with original thoughts from the author.

This book could become a standard undergraduate reference on non-standard news sources and the blurring of the lines between producers and consumers of information (or in the government world, of intelligence).

Resistance to change by established media; the incredible emotional and intellectual growth that comes from having a ""media"" of, by, and for the people that is ***open*** to new facts and context and constantly being ***refreshed***, and the undeniable ability of the people in the aggregate to triumph in their assembled expertise, over niche experts spouting biases funded by specific institutions, all come across early in the book.

The book is provocative, exploring what it means when more and more information is available to the citizen, to include information embedded in foods or objects that communicates, in effect, ""if you eat me I will kill you,"" the author's most memorable turn of phase that really makes the point.

While respecting privacy, the author notes that this may, as David Brin has suggested, be a relic of a pre-technological time. Indeed, I was reminded of the scene in Sho-Gun, where a person had to pause to defecate along the side of the trail, and everyone else simply stood around and did not pay attention--a very old form of privacy that we may be going back to.

Feedster gets some good advertising, and it bears mention that Trippi is still at the Google/email stage, while Gillmor is at the Feedster/RSS/Wiki stage.

Between Trippi and Gillmor, the term ""open source politics"" can now be said to be established. The line between open source software, open source intelligence or information, and open spectrum can be expected to blur further as public demands for openness and transparency are backed up with the financial power that only an aroused and engaged public can bring to bear.

Gilmor is riveting and 100% on target when he explores the meaning of all this for Homeland Security. He points out that not only is localized observation going to be the critical factor in preventing another 9-11, but that the existing budget and program for homeland security does not provide one iota of attention to the challenge of soliciting information from citizens, and ensuring that the ""dots"" from citizens get processed and made sense of.

The book slows in the middle with some case studies I could have done without, and then picks up for a strong conclusion by reviewing the basic laws (Moore, Metcalfe, Reed) in order to make the point, as John Gage noted in 2000, that once you have playstations wired for Internet access, and DoKoMo mobile phones that pre-teens can afford, the people ***own*** the world of information.

Spies and others concerned about deception and mischief on the Internet will appreciate the chapter on trolls, spin, and the boundaries of trust. Bottom line: there are public solutions to private misbehavior.

The chapter on lawyers and the grotesque manner in which copyright law is being extended and perverted, allowing a few to steal from our common heritage while hindering innovation (the author's words), should outrage. Lawrence Lessin and Cass Sunstein are still the top minds on this topic, but Gillmore does a fine job of articulating some of the key points.

The book ends on a great note: for the first time in history, a global, continuous feedback loop among a considerable number of the people in possible. This may not overthrow everything, as Trippi suggests, but it most assuredly does ***change*** everything.

I have taken one star away because of really rotten binding--the book, elegant in both substance and presentation, started falling apart in my hands within an hour of my cracking it open.

Phil,5.0 out of 5 stars,We The Media,The future of news gathering,"First a disclaimer. I've only read the drafts Dan posted on his blog. But from those chapters, this book is unlike anything written before. Dan is a rare combination of a strong technologist and brilliant journalist with strong ethics. Taken together this book describes events and makes predictions about the future of news reporting, particularly as it is influenced by the Internet. One of the best examples is a conference in which a CEO of a prominent company was speaking lamenting about his business problems. While this conference was being blogged, Buzz Bruggeman, reading the blog, did a quick search and found this speaker had just made a killing selling his options. Before he finished his talk he was confronted with this information, proving there's no where to hide when it comes to the Internet.",6
Paul Schmidt,3.0 out of 5 stars,We The Media,"Repetitive and blemished, but still worth reading","This is the first book I've seen on the incursion of citizen's media on the corporate news organizations, and has a fair amount of information on the history, and the technologies involved.

Dan repeats himself a number of times; for example, SMS gets defined multiple times throughout the book. A good developmental editor would have caught these problems, but this isn't difficult to overlook while reading.

The big blemish is that his left-leaning political views appear too often and too obviously. Early on, he even makes the claim that Big Media is politically conservative, something only he and Eric Alterman still seem to believe. His lefty, er, progressive readers might not notice, but because a number of the more popular blogs are antidotes to the liberal media slant, those of us who visit those blogs are likely to wince at some of his comments.

All that being said, overall, it's worth the read, until a better work on the subject comes out.",9
Grant Cairns,5.0 out of 5 stars,Random Curves: Journeys of a Mathematician,An inspirational autobraphy,"This is a fascinating book. It is the autobiography of Neal Koblitz, who is a well known mathematician, who has done important work in number theory and cryptology.
It documents the activities of Koblitz and to some extent his wife, Ann Hibner Koblitz, herself an accomplished academic in women and gender studies. It follows their experiences through student politics, their travels to the USSR and their political engagements in Vietnam, Latin America and elsewhere. It also has a chapter on Koblitz's work in the cryptology community, and one on the work in education conducted by Koblitz and his wife. It also has many reflections on higher education, both inside and outside the U.S., and on the differences between the sciences and the humanities. The book is written in a factual and often detached manner. At the same time, the book is permeated with the progressive ideas that motivated their experiences. One of the central thrusts of their efforts has been their organization of the Kovalevskaia Fund for the encouragement of women in science, technology and medicine in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

It seems that while not all mathematicians are left-leaning, in many parts of the world, mathematics departments have more than their fair share of lefties. (Koblitz actually offers a reason for why this might be the case). Many of us of the baby boomer generation, who participated in student politics in our younger days, will find this book riveting. But I think the book will appeal to a very broad readership; it is interesting and thought-provoking from beginning to end. And it is an inspiring case study of what an intellectual can accomplish.",3

That said, this book might be a bit thin if you don't have any experience with statistics or have access to a mentor.

Keeping in mind the that the book is a focused overview, it certainly supports the programmer who is looking for hands-on examples but I believe it also is useful for the non-programmer that needs a quick understanding of the core concepts. They may not be able to do the calculations but they will be able to participate in a conversation.

As it's concise and has active examples, the book would be a great supporting text for a course that requires assumes some statistics experience but doesn't need the overhead of a full-blown stats book. As I have mentioned in other reviews, this book is a good addition to the O'Reilly collection of books on data mining - Segaran's Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications, Russell's Mining the Social Web: Analyzing Data from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Other Social Media Sites, and Janert's Data Analysis with Open Source Tools.",15
Wilbur F. Pierce,2.0 out of 5 stars,Think Stats,I was disappointed by this book,"I was disappointed by this book. It purports to present stats in the Python environment, as a starter for people who are light in stats and heavy in Python. It's a thin book, but that would be fine if it delivered on its premise. The data he uses is not obtainable by a quoted link and the code in the book amounts, over many pages, to under 100 lines of Python. The statistics are bare-bones definitions that are quite well covered, better covered, in other books.

I was especially interested in the book because he promised to make some of the arduous formulae more understandable in the prospect of code. No code for those parts though.",2
Phillip Hershkowitz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Think Stats,Good but need to look elsewhere too,"I love this book because of the way it clarifies Bayesian statistics.

Allen is an excellent teacher but I only give 4 stars because Think Stats is more of a guide book to the material on his websites rather than a self contained teaching volume.

Professor Downey is very clear that without knowing Python you will struggle with the examples.

You need to know Python or at least be able to read it or the examples will not make sense.",3

Not only is Gutmann technically competent, he's also witty, so I find myself chuckling on occasion when reading his books (he especially likes to poke fun at PKI). On the downside, he writes run-on sentences at times. Sometimes I have to read something two or three times to parse it correctly.",1
Robert David STEELE Vivas,4.0 out of 5 stars,Database Nation : The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century,Quite Useful Exploration of Technology vs. Values,"I have been reading books about privacy, notably from Australia where they first got worried about this, and am an admirer of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) based in Washington, D.C. so I can say with confidence that this book is not completely original, but I can also say that it is quite useful. The single best and most original book in this area that I am aware of with my own limitations, is Jeffrey Rothfeder's 1992 classic, Privacy for Sale: How Computerization Has Made Everyone's Private Life an Open Secret.

The author captured my immediate interest when he posited early on that it is capitalism, not totalitarianism, that is the really grave threat to privacy, and then goes on throughout the book to demonstrate how capitalist innovation--and capitalist retribution--can find so many more profitable uses for stolen or insufficiently protected personal information including information about one's precise movements, Internet access, payments, and so on.

I credit the author with providing us with a really SUPERB discussion of an expanded definition of privacy and why it matters for the future, to include how a lack of privacy stifles free speech and individual voting or engagement.

The book is of course timely with the recent revelation of widespread NSA access to telephone records and widespread domestic telephone interceptions without warrants. I am quite certain NSA has full access to all travel and credit card records, and relatively certain that NSA is also obtaining full access to all banking transactions both within and passing through the USA. Eventually, as the dollar collapses and foreigners realize their financial transactions are not private, I suspect that the NSA intrusions will lead directly to a substantial reduction in what people are willing to transfer via US channels, and in this way deprive the US of interest and assets.

The author merits credit for anticipating in 1999 that terrorism would one day be used to justify extensive intrusions against privacy.

Most interestingly, the author reveals, for the first time to my knowledge, that NSA is in the phone card business. All those phone cards that terrorists and criminals have been using evidently have tracking information, and the testimony in the McVeigh case that the author illuminates makes it certain that this source and method will dry up for NSA with those who really matter: literate terrorists and criminals who, like Bin Laden, understand the value of open sources of information and make it their business to follow the literature.

Although the author's information with respect to credit card errors is somewhat dated, it merits comment that in 1991 there were errors in fully 43% of the files of the three main credit bureaus and--this I did NOT know--even if one corrects errors with those three credit bureaus, the corrections do NOT pass down to the 187 independent industry or localized credit bureaus that have purchased the incorrrect data prior to correction. More recently the industry claims a 1% material error factor, but in my own experience, the credit bureaus are quick to post liens or claims, and not at all interested in posting lien cancellations or settlements.

The author spends quite a bit of time, very usefully, in focusing on the fact that identity theft occurs due to lax banking and postal procedures (I for one am very upset over the countless offers of credit I receive in the undefended mail, offers that can be ""hijacked"" by anyone cruising for such mail before I collect it), and then denouncing the fact that victims of identify theft do not have ""standing"" in the courts--it is treated as a banking issue.

The book concludes with several scares and big ideas. Car have computers that can communicate--the day is coming when cars will report their owners for speeding, and a husband driving a wife bleeding to death from a farm accident will not be able to override the computerized speed limit. The author concludes that technology is eliminating the expectation of privacy, but I am more concerned by his documentation that we are becoming slaves to computers programmed by morons in bureaucracies.

The author suggests that a major challenge is how to create self-healing systems and I am curious as to why he did not know of Eric Hughes anonymous banking encryption protocols, in which only the bank and the client can see their banking data, which is otherwise constantly encrypted.

The federal government is clearly avoiding accountability, not only with respect to data privacy, but with respect to being accountable for who knew what when. The White House and the Senate clearly knew in 1974-1979 that Peak Oil was upon us (see my review of Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy and also of Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil), and deliberate decisions were made to conceal the facts from the public in order to keep the bribes coming and the easy elections going. We wasted 30 years because of decisions that can now be judged to be treasonous and retrospectively impeachable.

The book has acceptable coverage of biometics, RFID, public video, and commercial space imagery. In the latter, the book has a mistake SPOT Image likes to take credit for many things, and they evidently claim credit for creating a C-130 portable ground receiving station. This is not true. Colonel ""Snake"" Clark in the office of the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, conceptualized and oversaw the development of that capability which made a major difference to air operations in Bosnia among other places, as it made possible near real time seasonally accurate wide area imagery feeds directly into the Air Force mission rehearsal systems.

To end on a positive note, I point to page 108 of the book, where the author discusses inexpensive discreet video surveillance systems that can be used to keep an eye on kids, cats, baby sitters, realtors showing one's home, and so on. Technology does have its uses for the individual, and I will end by saying that I found this book to be a very professional and useful overview of the implications of both digital technology, and the personal information that technology can capture, store, manipulate, share, and exploit.",3
Frank Lynch,4.0 out of 5 stars,Database Nation : The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century,A challenge to your complacency.,"Garfinkel cover a wide variety of territory here, and you may not feel that all areas are an issue for you. The territory includes significant breaches, credit reports, health records & insurance forms, as well as direct marketing lists and practices. Garfinkel stresses that the issues are not just privacy-related, but also data integrity - - bad enough that others have access to the truth about your history, but mistakes in the data quickly get replicated throughout the business world.
You may not have a problem, for instance, with insurance companies asking you to allow them to share information, if you feel it increases the efficiency of the market. You may not have a problem with targeted marketing, which is built on customer profiles. However, after reading this book you'll have a better sense of the issues.
One anecdote was very effective, I thought, in challenging complacency on these issues. I have heard a number of people say their privacy won't be violated because their lives are too boring. Garfinkel tells a story that demonstrates how people who have too little to do will glom on information just because the information is there, whether or not it has practical value. He has a story about an office web camera focusing on the coffee pot; the camera is there so those coming downstairs to get coffee can manage their expectations and will know in advance whether or not they will have to make a fresh pot. Yet this picture of this innocent coffee pot gets heavy web traffic every day, from people who have nothing better to do than look at a coffee pot. So, being boring is not sufficient protection against the idly curious; less so against those with malicious intent.",1
Malvin,3.0 out of 5 stars,Database Nation : The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century,Fairly good treatment of an important subject,"As a veteran of the technology industry, Simson Garfinkel brings an insider's understanding of how personal data is collected and managed to his book ""Database Nation"". He seems to be genuinely concerned about where the unregulated use of information technology may be leading us as a society, and has chosen to write his book in an easily accessible style in order to present his views to as wide an audience as possible.

""Database Nation"" succeeds overall. The author provides historical context and anecdotes for each topic within the book, helping bring the subject of privacy to life. Indeed, the book contains many interesting, useful and compelling passages. Among these are discussions of identity theft, credit reporting, and direct marketing.

Thematically, I tend to agree with the author that a core problem has been the failure of our government to properly regulate the collection and use of consumer data in the private sector. Citing many real-world examples, Garfinkel succeeds in proving that today we have far more to fear from private industry than from government (although there is no doubt that significant problems remain with the way our government handles information).

The chapter on ""Kooks and Terrorists"", written prior to September 11, was remarkably and tragically prescient. Garfinkel suggests that we might best be served by tightly controlling and monitoring the instruments of destruction rather than attempting to track the entire civilian population. The author reasons that even if such tracking mechanisms were possible, no such predictive system of monitoring the intentions of millions of individuals could ever be infallible. It would be interesting to learn more about his thoughts on this subject today.

However, I was disappointed with the book on several counts. First, despite the repeated use of the word 'privacy', Garfinkel never really develops a theory of privacy: what it is, why we should care about it, and how citizens might be able to simultaneously enjoy the benefits of an information-rich world while living in a society that values and protects its citizens' privacy. Second, I was a bit surprised that the book scarcely addressed the issue of workplace privacy, which has been and remains a highly contentious and important issue for many working class Americans. Third, while Garfinkel often proposes relatively simple but brilliantly conceived laws to secure our privacy rights, at other times he suggests the implementation of additional layers of technology in order to solve problems related to the use of technology; this inconstancy left me a bit puzzled. Fourth, as others have pointed out, there is little information provided about how individuals can take action to protect themselves.

Despite these minor flaws, I recommend ""Database Nation"" as a fairly good starting point for learning about the important subject of privacy.",3
J. G. Heiser,3.0 out of 5 stars,Database Nation : The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century,I don't know what this book is supposed to be,"I've enjoyed other books co-authored by Garfinkel, but I just don't know what to make of this one.
The Infosec world tends to be characterized by Chicken Littles who are able to attract attention by claiming that the sky is falling down. This book is filled with sky falling down examples--some of which undoubtedly will come to pass. But I don't believe that most of them will. Just because something can go wrong, doesn't mean that it will, and this book is filled with wild speculation.
This book should really appeal to the paranoid and the conspiracy theorist, but I don't believe that it really provides much guidance in what is realistically going to take place.
It wasn't a bad read--the words are pleasantly arranged. But most of the scenarios in this book are just not credible to me, and the research is non-existent. Its an opinion piece, and I think most of the opinions are wrong.
Does not live up to its jacket cover.",3
Shawn A. Freeman,3.0 out of 5 stars,Database Nation : The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century,A little dated...,"Overall this is a good book, provided that you take it for what it is - an opinion piece. There are plenty of facts included in this book (many of which are out-of-date). However, the volume of facts does not support the volume of conclusions drawn by the author. For example:

Early on the author states that a failure to create a national database, instead of several independent ones as we have now, had lead to security issues and that the single national database would be better. He does not provide supporting material on WHY it would be better. There are other examples in the book that you can find for yourself.

Should you buy it? Maybe consider borrowing it, checking it out from the library, or getting a used one on eBay (mine will be there soon ;-)",1
Burju,1.0 out of 5 stars,Database Nation : The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century,"Outdated, inaccurate, shallow, full of crap","One thing I seriously do not understand at all:

You're writing a book about privacy. You criticize people exposing their private lives, criticize everything under the sun for intrusion of personal privacy. And you give very intimate moments of your life as examples. ""Once I wrote my wife a letter and I said in that letter...."" the author continues. Who cares about how you two met or decided to marry??

I believe it's a little bit too personal and completely irrelevant. The examples of his personal life don't even support any point he is trying to make. If you're bragging about privacy rights and can not conceal ""yourself"" behind the curtain no one will take what you're saying seriously. Write a memoir instead.

I think the author is confused about many many more points like this one. His examples are weak, inconsistent, or irrelevant. Here's another one: He is talking about his United Airlines mileage credit card and how he's used it many times to win 50000 extra miles by which he got domestic flight tickets for himself and his always-within-the-context wife. So he goes to a coffee shop and uses this card and thinks to himself ""Hey someone somewhere is making money keeping track of my purchasing habits."" And far, a few more pages later he criticizes Americans for ""giving up their privacy willingly for the sake of small benefits"". Excuse me??!? Your latte bringing extra miles probably tastes better than your privacy?

His technical knowledge is too shallow. His points are inaccurate perhaps because this book is outdated but he claims things that do not exist; such as how ""impossible"" it is to correct false information on your credit report. Or how banks make customers pay for fraud transactions.

Another really confusing point is that he is giving examples from the bible!! I find it very offensive to people who do not share his religious views. And beyond that, call me crazy but isn't he supposed to be talking with facts?

What bothers me most is the author's way of twisting the truth! He is either blind or ignorant. He spoke vaguely about all(!!!) the points that would have possibly brought about any criticism to the government. It's almost like he is playing dumb. I wonder who sponsored his book?!? It seems to me that he is worshiping some particular political parties?!?

He is talking about Philip Zimmerman's case, one of the most important cases in the history of privacy, in one sentence without giving any names or details.

Trurl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cryptanalytic Attacks on RSA,The Math of the Attacks of RSA,"Ok, so I don't admit to understand most of this book. The editorial review says that it is geared at professionals at the graduate level. My education is some undergraduate level. But I was able to follow along and learn a lot. Being able to derive and discover such theories and cryptography schemes is another story. These techniques are relatively simple with respect to seeing how the algorithms run, but the idea behind the number theory is profound. Meaning, seeing the algorithm is one thing and manipulating and attacking it is another.

But like I said, with the proper math experience and not knowing the mathematics behind RSA, you will learn a lot. That is why I give this book 5 stars. The reason I read this book is because in the comics and movies, spies are always using secret messages. I want to know exactly what the attacks on RSA are. And even though the material is difficult, I see the attacks and it gives me a mental picture of what is possible. In other words, those things I don't know, I want to know without getting a P.H.D in mathematics. So even if you don't have all the higher mathematical experience, you can learn from this book if you read through it.

I recommend knowledge of linear algebra and working with series. This book is to the point . It is not in traditional textbook format, so it takes a little more work to go through the theories and examples. The reference to other sources in that back of the book is extensive and is referred to often, because although this book is filled with details some subjects need explored more deeply if you plan on researching the certain topic more deeply.

Here is a listing of the attacks covered:

--Direct
integer factorization attacks--discrete logarithm attacks-- quantum factoring and discrete logarithm attacks

--Indirect
common modulus attack--fixed-point attacks--guessing d attacks--knowing Euler's totient function--forward attack--e-th root attack--short e attacks--short d attacks--partial key exposure attacks

--Implementation (side-channel) attacks on d, p, q
timing attacks--power attacks--electromagnetic radiation attacks--random fault (glitch) attacks

This list was taken from page 230.

I will also list some areas of interest I marked in the book:

--For some odd reason page 5 and 6 are reversed in the book. But there are no other print mistakes.

--Page 58 has Edouard Lucas's 1891 cylindrical cryptography problem that is unsolved.

--Russian mathematician Bouniakowsky discovered clever algorithm 1870 for a^x is an element of b (mod n) with asymptotic complexity. Not much is mentioned here. It is only a paragraph, but it caught my attention while reading.

--On various pages elliptic key cryptography is worked out. The book also list some alternatives to RSA and its variations. --elliptical curve--coding based--lattice based--quantum cryptography

As stated the material is advanced but explained mathematically in a very concise manner. In fact the book is mostly all mathematical steps with paragraphs only used to start or summarize the chapter. What makes this book is that everything that is written is to the point, but is worked out enough to follow along.

I really enjoyed this book. I was however expecting more to be said about Prime numbers. Yes, p and q are Prime, but I was interested in how knowing the Prime numbers would crack RSA. This would fall under the integer factorization problem, but I guess Prime numbers are not supposed to be solvable in polynomial time, so N is supposed to be secure. But I'll admit that much of my interest in this book was the RSA attacks. There is something mysterious and childlike curiosity when cracking a code. Granted it is no easy task and reading this book doesn't make you an expert code cracker overnight. It is step in that direction and introduces the reader to mystery of how messages can be encoded so only the right person sees them, but does it from a math perspective where there is potential to create even more mysteries in the field.

Oh, and another thing. I believe a logarithmic spiral can find a series in Primes if one exists. (vms)",1
Dr. Terrence McGarty,3.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Identification (Dover Books on Electrical Engineering),A Great Deal of Material But Weakly Connected,"There have been many books written on system identification such as those by Ljung and by Sage and Melsa. Many of the classic works consider the simple problem of finding the parameter ""a"" which is embedded in the differential equation dx/dt=ax+bu for example. One measures y=ex+w foe example and is asked to determine ""a"". Simple, but frustrating at times. The classic, at least now classic, approach is to use a Kalman or extended Kalman filter.

This book addresses this problem in detail. Yet it delays until the last portion of the book the now classic methods and in the first sections it rambles failing to provided any sense of structure. The author clearly understands the topic but he consistently fails to convey the message. He introduces examples which could be excellent opportunities to develop the theory but after the introductions he just leaves the reader flat.

The book lacks structure, detail, motivation, and on and on. He refers to my own text of almost 40 years ago now and yet even there and then we had introduced the modern view of identification. I hope Dover can reintroduce some of the better texts since this topic is current in many fields especially genomics which consider active secondary pathways and epigentic dynamics",9

I Teach Typing,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Picturing the Uncertain World: How to Understand, Communicate, and Control Uncertainty through Graphical Display",Great art and wit,"This book is filled with superb graphics and insights into the study of variability and the graphical methods that can be used to summarize data. It is written in many short chapters, each of which is based on one of the authors famous papers, that can be easily digested in about 5 or 10 minutes. While a few places Wainer goes off on brief tangents about the math (that distract from the flow and are hard to follow because the lack of detail) the book flows remarkably well especially given its fractured origins.

The graphics (especially the color plates) are a well rendered collection of great historical value. Graphics by Playfair, Florence Nightingale, Galton, Minard and people tracking deaths in Nazi occupied Lithuania are all talked about in detail. Beyond the art, some of the strong points of the book include: insights into what goes wrong when people do not study variability, the dissection of good and bad graphics to point out what makes a good graphic good, and a great discussion about the graphics of changes over time and how easy it is to misinterpret them.

The down side of the book is that many of the graphics can be rendered fairly easily with modern analytic software (like SAS, S-Plus or R) but the author does not give links for the novice. If you want to combine this with a book that discusses how to make good scientific graphics (like the examples in this book) take a look at the masterpieces by Cleveland Visualizing Data and/or The Elements of Graphing Data.",13
Abacus,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Picturing the Uncertain World: How to Understand, Communicate, and Control Uncertainty through Graphical Display",Interesting book with a few material errors,"This thought provoking book is a reasonably good follow up to Edward Tufte's remarkable work (The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 2nd edition). Wainer acknowledges that Edward Tufte is among the triumvirate of key contemporary contributors to the understanding of graphic display. Within chapter 11, Wainer reiterates Tufte's main principles of good graphics (don't use an artificial 3d dimension when you are dealing with 2 dimensional data, don't use legends, name variables directly on the graph, etc...). He also refers to the same body of standard setting 19th century graphs from William Playfair, Francis Galton, Florence Nightingale, and Charles Joseph Minard's famous graph of Napoleon's tragic Russian campaign in 1812 (deemed the best graph of all times). He shows those graphs in the book's mid section. He also lauds all these luminaries in Part V: History and then especially Charles Minard in his own chapter 19.

Wainer's favorite subject is studying and graphing the variability in data as captured by the standard error. Chapter 1 on the hazard of ignoring the larger standard error inherent in smaller samples is excellent. When you look at the average performance of schools or the average crime rate of cities invariably you will find smaller entities at both the top and bottom of such rankings. And, people invariably focus on just one of the extremes and derive the the conclusions they want (not the right ones): smaller schools are higher performers and smaller towns have lower crime rate. They don't. They just have a greater distribution of outcomes (associated with a larger standard error with small samples). Wainer revisits this subject in more technical details within chapter 9 on analyzing the College Boards error in only revising upward SAT scores that were penalizing students' score incorrectly but not revising downward the scores that were wrongly boosted. He also revisits technical aspects of the standard error and how to best graph it in chapter 13.

His use of graph to visualize the breakeven point of the Medicare Drug Plan is good. His chapter on figuring out trends in academic test scores vs per pupil expenditure is also interesting. You really have to pay attention to the scale of the graphs axes. That is especially true if there are two Y-axes. Wainer does a good job showing all the potential graph manipulations that can fool readers.

His chapter on ethnic bias is intriguing. Referring to the social science literature, he indicates that contrary to what the public thinks the SAT does not have a negative bias towards minorities but a positive one! Meaning that Black and Hispanic students SAT scores overestimate their success in college. Similarly, SAT scores underestimate White and Asian success in college. This is an interesting observation from an author who seems otherwise politically liberal.

Some of the chapters are pretty technical. This is the case for chapter 12 on exploratory data analysis. Chapter 13 also covers a lot of ground in hypothesis testing including: Type I and Type II errors, the problem of multiplicity (having to adjust statistical significance when dealing with multiple data sets), sensitivity analysis, resampling, and multiple imputation. Chapter 14 explores how you categorize your data in bins can generate erroneous trends and how to avoid this trap (do a scatter plot). Chapter 16, on Francis Galton seminal work in developing the Normal Distribution is also rather technical yet interesting.

However, Wainer is not always right. On page 33 and 34, Wainer wrongly attacks George Schultz on two graphs that are perfectly well presented. Change in GDP is the standard way of representing the performance of the economy (and not nominal GDP level as Wainer suggests). By the same token, change in employment is a good way to graph the health of the labor markets. It is better than the unemployment rate that Wainer prefers because the latter is distorted by the number of discouraged unemployed workers leaving the labor force. Meanwhile, the change in employment level is not affected by this.

Wainar could have conveyed what those graphs really meant. And, that is the economic cycle has a stronger influence on the political cycle than vice verse. Near the end of Bush Sr. term both GDP and employment dropped. And, they did not recover fast enough to prevent Clinton from beating him in the next election. Near the end of Clinton's first term those two factors remained strong and he was reelected easily.

Within chapter 13, I think he incorrectly applies the Bonferroni adjustment to standard errors when handling multiple data sets. That's even though he correctly explains how to calculate it. On page 123, I think he misapplied the mentioned Bonferroni adjustments as he adjusts by multiplying the standard error by 3.2 to test 40 variables. Instead, he should have divided the unadjusted significance level of 5% by 40 resulting in 0.125%. This means when testing 40 variables to reach a significance level of 5% instead of the Z value being 1.96 it should be about 2.50. Meanwhile, the standard error remains unchanged. His own adjustment is way too high and would result in committing numerous Type II errors (rejecting the null hypothesis when there is a statistically significant difference).",12

1-The analogies to the human body was not very relative and added not much real value.
2-The subject of vocabularies and fact models were not easy to understand (for me at least)
3-Busines Rules part: I felt that those were the heart of the book and provided good information about the subject.

cwalt03,1.0 out of 5 stars,Business Data Networks and Security,Not a fan!,"If I could give this book ZERO stars, I would. This book is awful to read! It feels incomplete like the author expects that you're learning the information from somewhere else and they are just there to refresh your memory. One of the End-Of-Chapter Questions in Chapter 6 began with: ""The following matters were not addressed specifically in the text."" Who writes a book to teach and puts a question like that in the End-Of-Chapter ""refresher"" questions?! I got more of a ""frustrated"" feeling than a ""refreshed"" one.

I took this course (Data Communications) in Spring 2015 and the instructor asked the students to comment on the course and book. Here are some of the comments that were written about the book:
""...poorly written and not a very good learning tool. How exactly are you supposed to learn when the author talks to you as if you already know the topic?""

This is not to say it has worthless content, it just doesn't fully develop or explain a fair amount of the content, it stays very cursory.

Tim Jones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Partial Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems with Maple, Second Edition",Good but where is the code?,"This is a nice, neat book that in a plodding, slow way gives lots and lots of examples of how Maple can solve PDEs. It is a bit unusual in that the first chapter, after a review of ODEs, goes right to Sturm-Liouville systems and Green's functions. Both allow for a nice and systematic treatment of PDEs in the subsequent chapters. I have typed up the code in this SLs chapter and it works just fine -- I used Maple 9.

The book should complement, not replace, a regular textbook by say Haberman. Haberman's explanations of theory are much better -- but nothing helps more than having a CAS do all the intense busy work that can be required for even a simple problem. The best is a combo of good systematic and thorough theory with many worked examples using automation.

For these purposes the book would get 5 stars, except that there is no website with the code, as the book indicates there should be somewhere. Going to the publishers site there is a dead link. Perhaps these things will be remedied soon. The long and short of it: it's a good book, but you will have to type in the code for each example. This can, of course, have didactic pluses, but, none-the-less, the author says there's a website and there isn't and there is no CD.",2

Book Jones,2.0 out of 5 stars,William Andrew Publishing Technical Writing Series: Single Sourcing: Building Modular Documentation,Somewhat disappointing,"I was recently investigating options for single sourcing when I came across Kurt Ament's book Single Sourcing: Building Modular Documentation. Based on the glowing reviews the book received, I decided to order it from Amazon.com.

Unfortunately, the book was not what I expected. For the price of $[...] on Amazon, the book provides little help to experienced professional writers. My biggest complaint is that too many pages of the book are spent promoting the author's own ideas of style and usage rather than discussing true single sourcing issues. (134 out of 210 pages, to be precise, were dedicated to matters of style.) Some of the style and usage guidelines are handy for modular documentation, however, I believe each company should decide its own appropriate guide for style and usage rather than relying on the author's word. Had he couched his preferred guidelines as examples, perhaps I would be less inclined to view them negatively.

Granted, understanding how to simplify and standardize language is key to developing text for reuse within a body of work and reuse text for localization. Writers need to understand how to simplify and standardize text before starting to think about how to leverage tools for single sourcing. Describing how to use standard language, however, is different than promoting a writing style, and probably requires far fewer pages than Ament dedicated to it.

One of the reviews on Amazon raved about how well this book could be applied in conjunction with Information Mapping. I disagree. The author clearly does not approve of breaking processes or procedures into tables, which is a cornerstone of Information Mapping. In fact the author has very strict guidelines about when you should use a table and when you shouldn't. (Again, he is pontificating a particular style rather than offering solid advice on single sourcing.) Don't take my word for it; examine the table of contents very carefully before you buy this book.

What the book does well, is offer good general advice on where to start thinking about chuncking your documentation in order to reuse it again and again. Also, Ament provides a concise lexicon of single sourcing terms that will help you properly articulate your ideas to your teammates. Most of the flags and highlighting I used in the book were confined to chapters 1, 2, and 5.

This book might serve well in an introductory professional writing course, but if your company is seeking guidance on single sourcing, find a book that is tool specific or find a book that sticks to single sourcing and leaves style and usage decisions up to you.",22

The authors of this book have a different approach, which is more fundamental and more powerful than Bayesian ideas. In fact, this basket of ideas can be used to troubleshoot and ""de-Bayes"" your Bayesian learner, and let you know when your prior is broken.
This book is the first exposition of the ideas of Vovk, Schafer and Gammerman on this subject, generally known as ""conformal prediction."" I've written a long blog on the topic. The ideas are useful in all areas of probabilistic prediction, anything from anomaly detection to semi-supervised learning can benefit from these ideas and techniques.
It's kind of a travesty that so few people seem to know anything about them; there are only a few open source code projects using the ideas, and I find I am the first person to review the book. The book requires some work; it's mathematical and far from a cookbook for the average practitioner.",1

John S. Ryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web: Designing Large-Scale Web Sites, 2nd Edition","Still handy, and still unique","There's a reason all the famous web-design folks recommend this book. It's still about the only book that addresses the design of _information_, and it still does the job very well.
O'Reilly has become justifiably famous with its user-friendly technical volumes, but this one is a bit of a departure. There isn't anything in here about how to code anything; there are no handy lists of functions or commands for easy reference. What there is is a thorough, focused but wide-ranging discussion of the issues facing someone who wants to make electronic information usable and accessible via a website.
(That includes database design, by the way. There isn't all that much detail and it's in the context of making websites searchable, but there's good discussion of e.g. controlled-vocabulary terms and how users actually look for information.)
The overall approach is refreshingly big-picture: the authors emphasize, for example, navigation _systems_ and labelling _systems_ (rather than just ""labels""), and they devote an entire chapter to ""conceptual design."" No wonder, three and a half years after its initial publication, it's still the standard reference work in a field that usually puts books out of date overnight.
And no wonder Jakob Nielsen thinks well enough of it to write the foreword. If you know who Nielsen is, you probably already have this book; but since none of the information on this page credits his contribution, it can't hurt to let readers know.
Ostensibly devoted to websites but generally applicable to any context in which electronic information has to be organized, this book should be somewhere on the shelf of every IT professional. If you like Steve Krug's _Don't Make Me Think!_ (as I do), you'll like this one too -- maybe better.

After reading the first two chapters I was convinced that the authors were on the right track. with web development in its infancy there are no standards for development of web sites that one can go by. This book, while in no way attempting to set or define any standards, attempts to list the principles and approach that an information architect should be taking when starting out on a web design project.
I found the fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters to be the very best. These chapters touch upon Navigation, Labelling, and Searching systems. The chapter on navigation systems was a relevation. Many a time navigations systems make absolutely no sense on even some of the more reputed web sites.
The chapter on Navigation systems is followed by the one on Labeling Systems. The relevation that emerges from this chapter is 'Know your target audience, and be consistent!'.
If I like this book, why don't I give this book 5 stars? Because I feel that because the authors do such a great job of explaing what 'Information Architecture' I was very disappointed by the lack of detailed examples in the book. There is one chapter at the end that deals with a real world example, but that is not enough. Something like the entire layout of a real world web site (or a hypothetical example even) that set out that web site's labelling system, the navigation system, the Searching system, etc.. would have made this book worth its weight in cybergold!

Both are excellent. This one is more focused on carefully orchestrating an approach to an enterprise architecture that makes content usable to end-users in context.

As the world gets ready to move toward exobyte scales of information sharing, at machine speed, this book becomes very relevant. While the authors are careful to point out the fallacies in cost calculations for informaiton access design flaws, I for one find the factors compelling--the cost of finding information, of not finding information, the value of rapid access, visualization and integration, the value of ease of use. I find the rough figure of $100 per employee per year to be a conservative estimate of opportunity costs--I think it is close to $1000 and in some instances $10,000.

Over-all I found this to be a superb reference for self-study, one that breaks down complex issues like different kinds of navigation systems, and one that also shows the value of offering end-users multiple means of access, both search and browsing.

Chapter 19 was especially valuable to me, since I am not even close to being a technical person or even a librarian--the itemization of the functions associated with information architecture and implementation, and why they might benefit from centralization, was a very helpful vehicle for getting a sense of the challenge when thinking of the scale of say Google, where thousands of hits are returned and thousands of relevant documents are NOT found. Google is great, but in this context, Google is in the second or third grade, at best.

twark maine,4.0 out of 5 stars,Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied Interaction (MIT Press),"Clear, interesting, inspiring, but also a little like a religion","One of the strong sides of this book is that it makes it really easy for the reader - things are generally summarized and repeated exactly in the right places. It can serve as an introduction to the world of phenomenology, sociology and philosophy as pertaining to Human-Computer Interfaces.
It felt more like a mixture between a proposal and an introductory philosophical treatise than an overview of the current state of the field (it carries the word ""foundations"" in its title for a reason).
After reading it however, I still wasn't convinced that ""social computing"", ""tangible computing"" and ""embodied interaction"" really add up to a construct that can effectively inform the design of new HCI devices even though this claim was repeated throughout the book almost like a prayer wheel.
Interestingly, while the book points out the meaning of embodiment in already existing work practices, it fails to give any strategies on how these theories can actually be applied to the design of effective new HCI devices that go beyond the shiny toys produced at MIT Media Lab.
The loophole seems to be that embodied practices can only arise once the tools are defined, so that it is hard to predict what practices will be used once it's out there - since the way we use tools is largely improvisatory, as Dourish points out.
I also can not stop to wonder if the term ""embodiment"" is akin to ""multimedia"" - a belief system that can mean so many things that it effectively disintegrates sooner or later.

So, while it left me not exactly sure that there really is another end to it, it was certainly worthwhile and inspiring to work through this book in a thorough manner - I now feel courageous enough to put my nose into ""Being and Time"" by Heidegger.

J. Michael Casey,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Myth of the Paperless Office (MIT Press),Paper is Still Useful in the Paper-Less Office,"I bought this book from Amazon in 2005, and would recommend it to anyone with a professional or personal interest in the ways people use paper and other types of information display surfaces. It continues to provide a valuable perspective on the uses of paper in the workplace and personal life. I especially appreciate the authors' approach to studying the way office workers (in their case studies) were interacting with paper documents, in ways that were not readily supported by available computers, screens and software.

As another excellent reviewer said, in 2010: ""What a difference 8 years makes. ... Selen and Harper's argument does remain relevant and thought-provoking in one important respect. They explain the unique functionalities of paper to argue why paper is better for certain tasks. In the last 8 years, some technologies have started to compete with the functionalities of paper. But [paper] remains more useful than screens for some tasks. Selen and Harper's arguments at least give us the analytical tools to think about whether certain tasks are better suited to paper or computers today.""

Today, more than a dozen years since the book was published, many office workers have had computers since childhood.
• Some have very large screens, and some use two or three screens at a time.
• Some office workers (and many travelers) get by with a tablet or smartphone, for many tasks – including reading books as well as email.
• People are indeed using computers more, and printing paper less.
• So we could call it the “paper-less” office …

However, paper still provides useful functionality, e.g., for certain research or editing tasks: when you want to flip back and forth quickly between two pages in different parts of a long document; or when multiple documents need to be viewed in parallel on a larger surface; or when one needs to consult several source documents and notes, while writing or entering data into a new document.
• We can't all perform those tasks efficiently on a smartphone!
• We might need more than two monitors, for some tasks.
• And some of us still prefer the feel of a crisp paper document or handwritten letter, with a ""wet ink"" signature ...

Today, the final ""office work"" product is almost always a digital document – unless it needs to be filed in court, or delivered to someone who doesn’t have email.
• After the work is finished, the convenience copies and work papers can usually be shredded.
• Increasingly, paper documents are scanned on receipt -- and saved as electronic documents for improved accessibility, sharing, collaboration, business process workflow, or business continuity.
• Overall, the need for keeping paper records -- and sending them to offsite storage for long-term retention -- is decreasing.
• And the need to retrieve the paper from storage has declined dramatically in recent years -- except when the electronic copies are lost, damaged or disputed.

It is worth noting that human-readable paper records can prove more durable than electronic documents, which may become inaccessible after a few years for a number of technological and behavioral reasons.
• To remain available and readable, electronic documents must be periodically migrated to new media (e.g., every 5 to 10 years)
• The electronic document format also matters: saved documents may become unreadable over time, unless stable format standards are used (such as PDF/A)
• Storage of paper documents may be necessary or advisable, when a person or organization needs to retain (and retrieve) important records over a time horizon measured in decades.

Paper is not dead. It's just resting!

• Unlike that Monty Python parrot ...
• And we're still not sure about Schrodinger's cat ...

If you were able to read all of this review without getting bored and moving on, you should definitely read the book!
• As a bonus, I guarantee that you will learn one new word!",2
Robert Dubose,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Myth of the Paperless Office (MIT Press),Interesting but outdated,"What a difference 8 years makes.

In 2002 it looked as though the authors were correct: the paperless office had been a myth. Technology had increased paper usage rather than decreased it. Many office workers still preferred to read and work on paper rather than screens.

But about the time this book was published, the ""myth"" started to become true. Per-capita paper usage in offices started to decline. In my experience, most office workers have switched from paper-reading to screen-reading in the last six years. And they have switched to screens for many of the tasks that the authors argued are better suited to paper reading. The difference is new technology. For instance, the authors argue that knowledge workers prefer to review, work, and collaborate on paper documents. As a lawyer, I found that argument to be true in 2002 when text-based programs did not include useful tools for collaboration. But developments since 2002 in programs such as MS Word and Adobe Acrobat have made it much easier to do tasks such as collaborative editing on a screen instead of paper.

Selen and Harper's argument does remain relevant and thought-provoking in one important respect. They explain the unique functionalities of paper to argue why paper is better for certain tasks. In the last 8 years, some technologies have been started to compete with the functionalities of paper. But some tasks remains more useful than screens for some tasks. Selen and Harper's arguments at least give us the analytical tools to think about whether certain tasks are better suited to paper or computers today.

This book was ground breaking in 2002. As a lover of paper, books, and libraries, I wish Selen and Harper had been right. I would be interested to see an updated edition that addresses the usage of paper today. But as technology has advanced, the argument of the current edition has become outdated.",14

Libb Thims,5.0 out of 5 stars,Information Theory and Evolution,A Nobel Prize Winning physicist does us all justice!,"Clearly, as we see by the last two reviewer's comments, a lack of education leads to confusion. Not that the ""thermodynamics of life"" isn't a confusing subject, but rather there exists no full textbook on the subject. For those interested, last week, I wrote up a quick review of thermodynamic evolution:

[...]

Quickly, let me point out a few things about the last reviewer's comments:

(1) Avery's book is a magnificent piece of intellectual crystal.

(2) Avery is a Nobel Prize Winner, and has degrees in BS physics (MIT), MS physics (Univ. of Chicago), PhD theoretical chemistry (Imperial College, London).

(3) Avery clearly makes a connection in this book between Gibbs free energy, being the total amount of energy available to do useful work in a reacting system, and Life. Well done Avery!

(4) Whenever a person does ""work"" it is owing to the electromagnetic fluxed through the earth system; a portion of this energy goes to ""evolutionary"" work [G], a portion goes to waste and friction [S].

(5) It is standard protocol when writing to break up your thoughts into paragraphs (note to last reviewer).

(6) Anyone who cites Dembski or Lambert as a source is a clearly missing the point.

Always remember, everything you see around you on earth is made from only three things: nuclei, electrons, and photons. If, at any time, you find someone trying to confuse you with ""fancy"" talk of information, bits, demons, entropy, etc., remember....its all nuclei-electron-photon interactions, as denied via QED; it's that simple - photon input causes things, i.e. molecular structures, to move or evolve.

Kent East,5.0 out of 5 stars,Service Science: Design for Scaling and Transformation,the wait is over...,"Finally, there is a book which developed a thesis to show how and why service is a new scientific discipline in the digital age. The book is academic, but it has used sufficient real world examples and arguments to make its content relevant to anyone who has an intellectual interest in the subject. Basically, the authors establishes that service is value co-creation; and hence new service is new value co-creation using digital connections among persons and organizations throughout the entire society and economy. The scope emcompasses every activity that employs co-creation in any domains, including agriculture, manufacturing, energy, and other sectors of the economy, as well as the traditional service sector. The newness is the new value propositions and new means of value co-creation: degitial connections scaling (up to the population, down to persons, and transformational to new business designs); and the analytic properties of such newness are hyper-networks built on societal cyber-infrastructure. The new science will, therefore, effect new design paradigms of population-oriented collaboration and new micro-economic production functions to facilitate digital connections scaling over hyper-networks. Ongoing practices in e-commerce/e-business and smart highways, for instance, are analyzed to illustrate the theory. This thesis is intriguing, and plausible. I would think that IBM, for one, in its latest push for a smarter planet, could find this book enlightening. Another thing is also worth mentioning: This is a truly interdisciplinary book, as service science itself is. It draws deeply from, e.g., information systems and technology, industrial and service engineering, business strategy, networks, and economics.",1

Don't let the title fool you, it could have been ""Modern Object Oriented development with .NET"". In the context of improving an existing active project (brownfield) this books walks you through separation of concerns, isolating dependencies, test driven development and many other concepts in a very practical and easy to understand way.

They also cover many of the political, cultural and personality issues you will face working with any company or team and suggest ways to work around, mitigate and sell new ideas into a situation. It is very easy to go with the flow but having the confidence to buck the flow on occasion can be a big win for everyone!

This was a good book for me. I was trained as an electrical engineer and spent 20 years designing computers before taking a turn into application development 17 years ago. I read constantly, listen to podcasts and hang around a lot of very smart people so have picked up most of the modern software design patterns. The advantage of applying particular patterns is not always clear so it takes a while to work new things into my development methodology.. mostly a good thing.

I thought the book did a good job of putting many concepts into a more comprehensive context than is normally presented. This approach has given me many good ideas about how I can better apply the techniques and motivation to investigate a few things I have ignored.",3
PKT,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Stochastic Models, Information Theory, and Lie Groups, Volume 1: Classical Results and Geometric Methods (Applied and Numerical Harmonic Analysis)",Mathematical results for the inter-disciplinary engineer,"I was drawn to this book, and its companion volume 2, as I have been working in areas of image and video analysis and using geometric techniques, and was looking for a handy reference for a broad selection of topics from modern mathematics. As a person with inter-disciplinary research interests spanning computer vision, machine learning, robotics, with a focus on mathematically grounded algorithmic approaches: I find these volumes to be exceedingly useful. Infact, I was pleasantly surprised to see many solutions to problems that I encountered during my work, being stated as 'classical results' in the book.

The theme of the book is not like standard math texts, i.e. the focus is not so much on theorem proving, rather the focus is on surveying several related results in a manner approachable to most engineering researchers. But which results to survey, and which not? Chirikjian displays an uncanny knack to survey those results that are practically implementable. This book does not directly connect result and application; but takes one sufficiently close to allow the earnest engineer to make their own connections.

In general, I have come to realize that very little of modern mathematics has made its way into modern engineering curriculum (at least electrical engineering to be sure). The volumes by Chirikjian can be very easily used by engineering instructors to introduce more sophisticated mathematics in their courses. I certainly plan to do so in the near future, and these books will in all likelihood will be core texts for such a class.

On a broader note, as research becomes more and more interdisciplinary -- requiring engineers to be able to connect dots in non-obvious ways -- mathematical communications of this kind will be extremely important.",1

I have been through the Captivate 5 training at Lynda.com. The training was great but not very in depth on advanced issues. I was hoping this book would help. I am sure it will on somethings. I am an active learner and wanting more information than just a set of directions. For me this book is hard to work with. The author assumes you are familiar with the layout of the program which is fine. However this assumption will leave some students floundering. For me a the list of directions without connecting together of concepts and being able to see an end project leaves me with out a end to shoot for. These basic points leave me questioning if I am going to find the answers to my questions. I purchased the book because I know the program can do things that I cannot find the directions for. I am afraid I am no closer to find out how to make the program do what I want it to do then before I started this book. There is also no main index to be able to jump through the book to find answers. You just have to go page by page.

The author starts you off by creating an account at adobe.com and using it to upload files. If you are not wanting to do that,like me, then some of the directions are going to leave you floundering. The information in the book is solid and I recommend it because of that. However, if technical writing leaves you flat like it does me. Then I would recommend another book.

What is funny is I just took a technical writing course. It seems the mental curses I have been throwing at technical writers is not the writers it is the technique of technical writing.",1

Brian J Boyle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]",A Book That Explains Everything About Who Made What (and How) You Can Read This Review On the Piece of Glass In Front of You,"Like anything Gleick writes (Chaos, Genius, Faster...) it is a non-fiction work that is hard to put down yet when you've read it you still want more!

This is an EXTREMELY broad and deep subject and its treatment as an ever-accelerating history --from unexpected complexities of African drums,
to the subtleties of Morse's and other codes, to the exponentially growing and overwhelming surfeit of ubiquitous information today-- serves as a
beautifully well-integrated, lucid and comprehensible foundation for the expertly crafted centerpiece: Claude Shannon's Theory of Information.

To tie together the totality of the technology that is most central to the 21st Century with the encoding of the double helix 21 million centuries ago
(an approximation, assuming RNA preceded DNA as Life's Secret Decoder Ring for about half of its history,) could take as many volumes as
Gibbon's, Wells' or Churchill's histories. Yet with the finesse of the ever-so-clever encoding that lets us put all nine of Ludwig's symphonies in
perfect precision on a 100mm-diameter piece of plastic or compress a 1+Gigabit/second 1080i streaming video into the 20 Mbit/s MPEG
transport stream on the Internet, Gleick manages to squeeze it all in and make it as much a ""page-turner"" as any Tom Clancy technothriller.

Shannon, the nominal intellectual Ulysses of this multifaceted Odyssey, would have celebrated his 100th on April 30 (2016,) but those in
the world of technology impacted by his work (to wit, EVERYTHING) --from Bell Labs, MIT, Boston Museum of Science and the IEEE and ACM
technical societies have planned to do it for him at dozens of universities and sites around the world. (And, perhaps, beyond: Voyagers I & II,
which have now left the Solar System, directly employ his 1948 ""A Mathematical Theory of Communication"" to let their electronic whispers
""phone home"" over eight billion miles, the same mathematics of signals that lets us Skype with a friend in Tibet.

In a rare class with Turing and Feynman, according to his widow, Betty, (whom he met at Bell Labs a half century before,) had Alzheimer's not robbed him of his genius by the arrival of the new millennium he did so much to create, ""He would have been bemused"" by all this Magick,
(i.e., ""sufficiently advanced technology."") From the Bells Labs and ""Brass Rat"" old-timers I've spoken with who knew him, I believe this one quiet man who wrote TWO PhD theses at MIT in 1940 --""A symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits"" and ""An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics""--
would been bemused by AND have loved that this book that fully lives up to its subtitle: ""The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood...""",2
M. Zimmerman,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]",Mixed bag,"I read this book soon after Charles Seife's Decoding the Universe, which is also a popular book about information theory. I started reading this because I read Gleick's Chaos and remember liking it (though it was something over 20 years ago, so I don't remember the details).

Seife's book covers does a *much* better job of explaining, mainly with thought experiments, how information theory relates to relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. I'm sure that the real science of information theory is much more technical than what Seife presents, but Gleick basically glosses over these issues by comparison.

Gleick's book is longer than Seife's and has more historical context. It also covers more ground, though long chunks of it seem only tenuously connected with information theory. I enjoyed reading about the historical actors concerned with computation, cryptography, etc, but wish he would have dealt more with the subject of their investigations. I found a few chapters long-winded and boring - with a lot of flowery words and little substance. The Prologue and Epilogue were particularly hard to slog through - I learned that ""information"" is really important today because of the internet. Does this have anything much to do with information theory? I never found out.

Both books do a poor job, for me, in their attempts to connect information theory to evolutionary biology. Sure, DNA is ""information"" and it is like a ""code."" But what do the findings of information theory tell us about evolution beyond loose analogy? Neither book provides much of an answer.

Gleick does a particularly bad job with his chapters on evolutionary biology and cultural evolution. It seems like he read Dawkins's 1979 popular science book, The Selfish Gene, summarized it, and then ignored any research into evolutionary biology conducted before or since. For example, one gets the impression, from reading Gleick, that Dawkins invented the concept of kin selection (he didn't any more than Gleick invented the theory of relativity) and that Dawkin's ""memes"" are the first and last word on cultural evolution (they aren't - see Laland and Brown's Sense and Nonsense for more). I found this very unsatisfying since my main interest in information theory is its connection to evolutionary theory.",7

Well written, but definitely a book to savour and mull about, not something you can skim.",1
Phil Nova,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]",History? Check. Theory? Check! But where's the Flood?,"Other reviewers have already gone into detail regarding the subject of the book, so I won't belabor that here. The author jumps from talking drums to the telegram to Charles Babbage to transistors, and Gleick is so good at drawing connections between these subjects that it never feels disjointed. It's a really masterful demonstration of how to weave biography, science, and history into one satisfying whole. As a reader with a technical background but no knowledge of the subject, I appreciated the level of rigor in the theoretical sections of the book, although I could see how it might alienate non-techie readers. My advice to them is: read this book anyway, and if it gets too dense, just skip ahead. It's too important, and too well-written, to miss entirely.

The book is divided into three sections, and each considers a different question. The ""History"" section asks: how does the way information is transmitted affect the way we think? One of Gleick's major theses here is that formal logic is a byproduct of written language, and he is very convincing on this point. Another very compelling section was the stuff about early computers, and the story of Babbage and Lady Ada. Gleick has a gift for making scientists relateable, and his enthusiasm for unconventional thinking is contagious.

The ""Theory"" section spells out Shannon's information theory, and brings some much-needed attention to the work of the most influential scientist you've never heard of. As I've said, this part can be a bit technical, which I appreciated, but if that's not your style, you can skim parts of this section without losing the major points. The description of Turing machines was also a highlight. Gleick's exuberant descriptions give the reader a sense of the excitement that the scientists themselves must have felt as they created these deceptively simple, staggeringly powerful theories.

Then... the ""Flood."" I'm a huge fan of Gleick's, but he really dropped the ball on this one. Ostensibly the last section of the book deals with the modern problem of data deluge, but it's a disappointment: there's little research or actual information, and plenty of conflicted hand-wringing. It almost seemed like it had been tacked on by another author. To some extent, this is okay -- data deluge isn't really what this book is meant to be about -- but given how big of a part this section plays in the marketing of the book, I would have preferred that Gleick just left it out entirely and shifted his focus to the book's much stronger sections.

The ""Flood"" section isn't bad, necessarily, just a disappointment compared to the quality and depth of the first two sections. Luckily, it doesn't detract much -- just don't expect more than a cursory look at data deluge from this particular book.

All in all, a very strong popular science book (which could just as reasonably be called a history book). If you're a pop science fan, you're probably familiar with some of the ideas and events described here, but only the very rare reader won't have something new and exciting to discover. It's mostly accessible to non-geeks, too; just plan on skimming the occasional section if you're hopelessly math-averse.",2
LittleMac,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]","Enjoyable, very well written, history of information technology","The is the first James Gleick work that I have read. I am impressed. He writes cleanly and clearly, with little ""fluff"" and he seems to understand what he is writing about. It surely took a lot of background work before he was ready to tie so many disparate pieces of history together. I am also impressed in that Mr Gleick seems clearly to want to get the history right and not to push his personal ideas, interpretations, morals, and politics. I am reminded of the James Burke (BBC/PBS) works as he shows how knowledge that at first seems unrelated becomes related thru the work of many men and women scattered in time and geography. This is a history, not a textbook on information theory; there is only a smattering of simple formulae and drawings.

The book uses the contributions of Claude Shannon as a thread to tie everyone's work together, but this is not a biography of Claude Shannon.

The final chapters are a bit weak in my opinion, especially following such solid work as the preceding chapters. One of the weak (in my opinion) chapters is devoted entirely to Wikipedia. I am enthused with Wikipedia but I don't think it is yet clear what will be a future historian's view of Wikipedia and that it deserves its own full chapter.

Overall I found the book to be very enjoyable and educational, adding considerably to my previous knowledge of Mr Shannon's work and bringing me new knowledge of how Mr Shannon's work linked with the work of others to bring us our current ""information age.""",4
Juan-Pablo Caceres,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]",Information and its Entropy (or how we extract wisdom from a flood of data),"There are two milestones that shape the main theses in this book. The first is, naturally, Claude Shannon's formulation of his ""Information Theory"". Shannon is rightfully the main character of this historical saga (Gleick inserts biographical snippets of him and other main character throughout the book). The second pivotal moment comes with the intrusion of entropy in this theory and in the realization that information, as a physical entity, is also subjected to it.

Gleick is a great writer and a pleasure to read. He presents his topic thematically, chronologically, and inserting biographical elements to shape something like an informational saga. He not only engages the reader but also explain difficult concepts in great detail (his presentation of Gödel's incompleteness theorems is an example.)

With an intermixture of Entropy and Information Gleick discusses the most important issue from a human perspective: how to extract knowledge and wisdom from a flood of data. It is very interesting to realize that our modern discussion is just a last iteration of searching and filtering. From library indexing, book catalogs, almanacs through our modern Internet algorithms, the problem remains the same: when all information is available, how do you find it and when does it become meaningful? The author is right in using Borges's ""The Library of Babel"" as the perfect metaphor for it.",1
Rosie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]","charming, eclectic and very informative","I wondered what aspect of information Gleick would be treating - knowledge and its communication and storage, the rise of information in physics as a conceptual inverse to entropy and its engagement in black hole theory, or even the information age.

My complete satisfaction with Gleick's past work, especially the thoroughness of his notes and his eclectic exposition, compelled me to preorder this book. The Information is all of the above and more. He presents a history, including the fundamentals of language as, for example, employed for millennia by African drummers, then traverses the history of writing (even spelling), difference and analysis engines to the evolution of telegraphs and telephony. The theory then champions the work of Godel, Turing, Shannon, von Neumann and Wiener as information takes on a physical context and leaps into the age of digital logic. Gleick's notes became my list for texts to further read around the topic. Then comes the flood, the rise on the internet, Wiki and the cloud.

The Information is a rewarding and enjoyable read and contains many of the charming minutiae that Gleick's research uncovers. As he listed the objectives of Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica and its imminent demolition, Gleick describes the early days of the demolisher, Godel, attending smoky Viennese coffee houses and expounding logic. Highly recommended.",1
Ben Rothfeld,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]",Not as great as his other books,"If you're expecting another ""Chaos"" or ""Genius,"" you might not like this book.

Partially, Gleick gets into the weeds on quantum mechanics, which is a topic I simply can't grasp. But the main thesis is that information theory has penetrated many areas beyond communications and engineering, which is interesting.

What's missing, I think, is the rich history that he typically delivers. This history tends to give excellent context for the subject. I was expecting to hear, for instance, about how the telegraph or the telephone radically transformed the spread of information. By and large, the book merely nodded at those points.

I would recommend, however, reading the chapter on African drums. That's worth the price of admission.",1
Edoardo Angeloni,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]",The competence of Gleick is very strong.,"In the first chapters, Gleick talks longer about the historical origins of the logics.

In the 1700-1800 it starts the Industrial Revolution with a particular form of tecnology, that step-by-step becomes always more important.
The first computers, those had an exit very slowly, are early substituded by the modern computers.
This fact follows by a research very strong, particullarly by the works of Shannon, von Neumann,Wiener.

The section on Charles Babbage and Ada Byron was particularly interesting. The period just after WWII saw spectacular advances in this area, including Shannon's information theory, Turing's universal machine, Von Neumann and Morgenstern's work on game theory and Gleick covers it well.

I found that the book bogged down somewhat after that. I never believed the concept of memes was useful and Gleick's chapter on it did little to convince me. I also found the last few sections, which try to make sense of meaning as opposed to information unsatisfying.

This history of gathering, processing, categorizing, and replicating information is deep in every sense of the word, but so beautifully and clearly written that one gets swept along in it, much like the rivers of numbers and other data Gleick so ably describes.

There are innumerable fascinating anecdotes illustrating the lives and careers of men like Charles Babbage, Alan Turing, and Norbert Wiener as well as inventions and developments like the original telegraph system, ENIAC, and Wikipedia.

Martin Zook,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]",Your Guide to the Universe,"The Information, extraordinary for its universal breadth and depth, is an outstanding survey of the Information Age, its roots, growth, and fruition. In the words of Seth Lloyd: ""To do anything requires energy. To specify what is done requires information."" And that is what Gleick quite successfully sets out to do: specify what the Information Age is all about.

Where others - McLuhan say - offer their own insights, Gleick integrates the findings of philosophers, mathematicians, physicists, biologists, engineers, explorers, authors, and those who have implemented information technologies over the millennia into the mandala of his text. Despite this comprehensiveness and a dash of math, The Information is well within the grasp of a thoughtful general readership.

Information development and proliferation is examined from two necessary perspectives: mechanical and meaning, the yin and yang of communications. Mechanical covers how information is conveyed including physics governing the origination, transmission, and duplication at the receiving end. For those familiar with Claude Shannon's work, Gleick gives much play to the work of the father of Information theory, including the link with meaning - the recognition that the degree of uncertainty heightens the value of the information.

It seems to me - and this is the reader speaking not to be confused with Gleick or any of his sources - that when applied to meaning, that understanding how uncertainty affects information can go a long way to explaining how misinformation can be so widely circulated during the information age. On the one hand, many people are uncomfortable with the tsunami of information that defines our time, and they seek out the newest (most uncertain) information that supports the maintenance of their comfort zones. Hence it's possible for organizations such as Fox and its phalanx of seemingly insane commentators to continually replicate information with a high degree of uncertainty that can be perpetuated endlessly and without being devalued. Refuting it only increases misinformation's uncertainty and high value. The same principal obviously applies at least to a degree to many religions, propaganda, and information promoting a point of view or an agenda.

The chapters delving into meaning, including the fantastic Into the Meme Pool, will have the widest appeal to general readers such as myself. Gleick immediately introduces us to the proposition offered by the Frenchman Jacques Monod that above the biosphere is an ""abstract kingdom"" of ideas, which are re cognized as replicating, living organisms: ""they tend to perpetuate their structure and to breed; they too can fuse, recombine, segregate their content; indeed they too can evolve, and in this evolution selection must surely play an important role."" It should be added that information technology itself guides, sometimes controls, but is never absent from that selection process.

Gleick also gives generous play to the works of Douglas Hofstadter and Richard Dawkins in this adventuresome exploration of organic thoughts.

When it comes to regarding the flood of information that typifies the Information Age, Gleick offers two defenses against being overwhelmed: search and filter. As someone who makes his living figuratively chopping wood and hauling water in the Information Age, I can't argue with that sparse comfort.

But my heart soars like a hawk when Gleick invokes Lewis Mumford: ""Unfortunately, information retrieving, however swift, is no substitute for discovering by direct personal inspection knowledge whose very existence one had possibly never been aware of, and following it at one's own pace through the further ramification of relevant literature.""

Ultimately, Gleick invokes Marshall McLuhan: ""'we have extended our central nervous systems in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is concerned. Rapidly we approach the final phase of the extensions of man - the technological simulation of consciousness, when the creative process of knowing will be collectively and corporately extended to the whole of human society.'""

Here, he takes on the ambitious task of tying in research from linguistics, theoretical physics, molecular biology and computer science. As other reviewers have mentioned, this book is appropriate for scientists in areas where information theory overlaps.

As a history, it has great moments, interspersed IMO by long-winded indulgent sequences that could have been edited down with little loss to the book.

In the last quarter of the book, I was stunned to find two glaring, well, errors. Gleich attributes the creation of Wikipedia solely to Jimbo Wales. Perhaps he and his editors have been living under a rock? Larry Sanger co-founded Wikipedia with Wales, and that is a widely known fact despite Wales' attempts to hog all the credit. Furthermore, Gleich attributes ""Moore's Law"" solely to Gordon Moore, when again, in computer science it is widely recognized that although this rule of thumb got Moore's name, he did not originate the idea. These serious glitches made me wonder how much of the other history, with which I am not as familiar, has similarly glaring biases. It made me doubt the rest of the book.

Still, because of its real high points and the difficulty of the attempted fusion of ideas across fields in a useful way, I'll give it a four. Really 3.5, but if I must round, I'll go up because of the difficulty level.",4

You might recall that in the 80s Gleick wrote the `Chaos' that laid out Complexity Theory to popular audiences. Words like Strange Attractor, Butterfly Effect, Fractals and Mandelbrot joined the popular culture. It was such a sensation that folks created music and paintings of complexity theory images! He also wrote a book on Richard Feynman titled `Genius' and another one on Isaac Newton - both terrific reads.

This new book, ""The Information,"" is an excellent read. He introduces us to Claude Shannon, the father of information theory - whose master's thesis at MIT is considered by professionals as the `single most significant work in the 20th century' - a century that included Einstein! Claude Shannon was raised in Gaylord, MI and went to U. of M.

The book shows how Claude Shannon precisely defines the word `information', just like Newton precisely defined the words Mass, Time and Force. The fruits of the digital revolution that we enjoy today can be traced directly back to Claude Shannon's seminal work at the Bell Labs.

There is a brief YouTube video produced by U.C. Television on Claude Shannon that is worth a watch.

The eminent Physicist Wheeler spent time with Claude Shannon at Princeton, and was impressed with him. Towards the end of his life, acknowledging Shannon's work, Wheeler says, ""It is bit.' Meaning that the world (it) that Physicists are trying to describe is really `bit' (information). Which is in a way is a strange echo of an old saying in Sanskrit from India - `You are It.' This phrase meaning that there is no difference between the individual and nature. So I put these two statements together to derive the following corollary - You are a Bit (!) - meaning we are all pieces of information! :-)

Gleick however points out a potentially troubling consequence to Shannon's work. What Shannon did was to explicitly separate meaning from data. Thus the digital revolution is efficient, mechanized and far reaching. However it seems that the task of 21st century leadership is to forcefully connect meaning back to data.

As far as the overall book is concerned, it would be a disservice to say it is a book about Claude Shannon. I would suggest that the author uses Claude Shannon as a narrative device around which to spin this fascinating tale. Indeed he goes farther back than Plato and Socrates in History and as far away as African Tribal drummers through to Charles Babbage and Alan Turing. He traces the digital revolution past its seminal inception at the Bell Labs and carries out forward to the flood we are experiencing today. And leaves us at the precipice of a new world wondering what new turns await us next.

I feel like not just crediting Gleick for this well written book, but celebrate a writer who can maintain such a high standard of science writing for over thirty years.",16

James Gleick, like many other journalists or historians similar to Malcolm Gladwell, whenever write about technical subjects, really come out oversimplified and just plain corny. Either there is too much anecdotal talk about something that even the author doesn't seem to be clear about, or a collection of disjointed quotes in a feeble attempt to a make some point.

Jean-Guy Rens,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]",Lack of coherence,"Being myself a former Bell employee I bought ""The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood"" as soon as I read the review in ""The New York Times"". Began with the greatest interest, I quickly became dismayed when after a brief prologue on-focus, James Gleick goes to visit the language of African drums, not that the subject is uninteresting, but not during 20 pages. In the same chapter, he jumps suddenly to ""Samuel Morse struggling with his own percussive code, the electromagnetic drumbeat designed to pulse along the telegraph wire."" And thereafter another chapter on the birth of cuneiforms in Sumer, the cultural discontinuity brought by writing in ancient oral civilizations and the reluctance shown by Plato vis-a-vis the written text. Isn't it enough? Comes a long digression on the invention of the first English dictionary in 1613 by an obscure priest under the title ""A Table Alphabeticall, conteyning and teaching the true writing, and understanding of hard usuall English wordes"". Interesting? Maybe, but what is the connection with the Information Theory?

Again, all these developments are intrinsically interesting and by times even fascinating (like the section on Babbage and Ada de Lovelace), but they dilute our interest and soon we loose track of the theme of the book which was supposed to be the information theory. When Gleick finally tackles his subject, we are already at chapter 7, and of course he speaks about the encounter of Claude Shannon with Alan Turing. We learn much more on the beauty of Turing's decyphering than about Shannon's Information theory. And Gleick goes on and on for another 8 chapters musing about Maxwell's demon and entropy... Gleick is his worse enemy. He is an erudite and it shows! But he does not know how to follow a demonstration order. Logic is not his forte. He needs a good editor.",18
Antonio,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]",The Information: the disappointment,"The book is titled ""The Information"" as an acknowledgement that information is an all-important concept in today's world. Unfortunately, it is also all-encompassing and used by different people to mean somewhat related, but different things. I was expecting the book to explain, if not what information *is* (there is no real agreement on that yet), at least some insights into its nature. Instead, we are given some (very nice) stories about researchers (from Morse to Shannon). Very well written, very entertaining, but anecdotal in nature, and very incomplete: there is way more to the concept of information that Shannon's theory (Shannon himself was the first one to make clear that he had limited his theory to some aspects of information encoding and transmission. In fact, he thought that ""Information Theory"" was a misnomer, and indeed it is). The book does offer some insight into Shannon's theory and related areas, including the use of information-theoretic concepts in physics and biology. However, other books have done this before and, in my opinion, better. In particular, the connection with 'entropy' in physics is not nearly as clear cut as the author makes it to be. All in all, if you already know a bit about Shannon's theory and have read some of these other books, I think this one will be disappointing. It's still a nice read -just does not have much *information* on it...",23
H. M. Gladney,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]","Good history, weak epistemology","As many popular authors do, Gleick is hiding his e-mail address. Although this is understandable, it also blocks meaningful dialogue with scholars who understand his topics as well as he does. ==> It is necessary to publish the following critique broadly instead of discussing it quietly with the author.

As good as the book is as a historical chronicle, it repeated suffers from unwarranted obfuscation--in this case failure to identify a thoroughly understood epistemological topic in clear, readily-understood language in favor of elevating it to something seemingly mysterious.

The question I have in mind is the distinction between objects and values. (E.g., the number 5 is not an object, but rather a value which is shared by all sets that contain exactly five members.) The obfuscations I charge Gleick with are particularly prominent in his Chapter 9, ""Entropy and Its Demons"". which concludes with, ""Most of the biosphere cannot see the infosphere: it is invisible, a parallel universe humming with ghostly inhabitants. But they are not ghosts to us ..."".

All this b.s. (an appropriate appellation) would vanish if Gleick simply pointed out that early 20th-century philosophers (Bertrand Russell, WIttgenstein, and their predecessors and successors in epistemology) understood and commented on the distinction.

This weakness makes the book misleading--sufficiently so that I recommend against anybody trying to understand information theory from spending time with it.",7

James Gleick is a good writer. But he doesn't have a whole lot to say, here. One thing he does in this book is draw a distinction -- or rather highlight someone else's distinction -- between ""information"" and ""meaning"". This book has a fair amount of the former, not enough of the latter.

I learned the term ""noosphere"". And the book gave me a keener appreciation for the degree of information pollution that has arisen from the latest leaps in technology that make it easier than ever for anyone to disseminate anything: I will think harder before publishing just any old blog post. I even thought hard before posting this review! This is not a bad book, but the ratio of text to meaning is annoyingly high. The acknowledgements, notes, bibliography, and index comprise more than 40% of the book's length.

Mark Stahlman,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood [Hardcover]",All Message: No Medium for Understanding,"Unfortunately, James Gleick has missed a great opportunity with this one. Like many generalists, he got bogged down in the details of topics he doesn't have a grounding in (i.e. information theory) and missed the relevance of the cultural transformation that is happening all around him (i.e. digital social media.)

He doesn't Twitter. He writes long books. Fine. But since his Epilogue is titled ""The Return of Meaning"" he owes it to those who get to the end to express something meaningful. Instead it seems he was overwhelmed by ""the"" information.

This problem is particularly painful when it comes to Marshall McLuhan -- who is his constant foil from the beginning (on page 8) to the end (on page 413), with 16 more mentions in between. Gleick apparently doesn't like McLuhan. That's okay but he owes it to his readers to at least ""get"" McLuhan straightened out. Instead he confuses things completely by claiming that McLuhan was both the ""spokesman"" for pre-Christian oral culture and also in the ""service of modernity"" (page 48). If that contradiction wasn't bad enough, he also correctly noted that McLuhan was a Catholic, which actually means in McLuhan's case that he believed Christianity was ""better"" than paganism and that ""modernism"" was the enemy of the Church -- not something he could ""serve.""

This basic confusion about the only personage who is mentioned throughout the book casts doubt on his knowledge of the others he writes about.

Lenny Rachitsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Complete Web Monitoring: Watching your visitors, performance, communities, and competitors",A new paradigm for monitoring your business's online presence,"This book will change the way you think about your online business. From page performance, to conversions, to user experience, to social media, ""Complete Web Monitoring"" covers the gamut of tools, techniques, and services that exist today to help you truly optimize the success of your online business.

The book breaks down all online business into four categories: Media, Transaction, Collaboration, and SaaS. Throughout the book, as you learn about the various flavors of analytics, usability, surveys, page performance, monitoring, online community management, collaboration...and how all of this fits together...you are given specific, direct, and actionable steps to take that apply to your specific business model. For example, ""Transaction"" businesses must focus on conversions, uptime of the checkout process, and what customers are saying about their products. ""SaaS"" companies should focus on the performance of their most common paths through the application, popularity of specific features, and the user experience of the holistic product.

The amount of data and the number of tools at your disposal are overwhelming. At times this book is rather overwhelming. Choosing between an analytics provider, a monitoring service, or a social media tracking service could keep you from actually accomplishing real work. Sometimes too much choice and too much data is a very dangerous thing. It's important to remember to step back, remember the goals behind your measurements, and focus on solving the problems of your customers. With that in mind, the lessons learned in this book will help you zero in on optimizing those end goals.

""Complete Web Monitoring"" is valuable for the same reason it is difficult to categorize. The various tools and services that you learn about are generally used by many different departments across an organization, all for very different reasons, generally without any sort of collaboration. What you realize reading this book is that there is a lot more to the success of your business than the limited visibility you get from using these tools independently. To truly understand how your business is doing, and how you can improve not only revenue but also how you build your business, you need a holistic picture that includes data from numerous sources. ""Complete Web Monitoring"" gives you more then anything I've come across previously in giving you the tools, pointing you to the techniques, and teaching you to focus on what is most important.",7
Steve S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Complete Web Monitoring: Watching your visitors, performance, communities, and competitors",Excellent depth of coverage,"The authors to an excellent job at covering the material.

The authors have also clearly been involved with properties that tie into larger infrastructures through their reference to adjacent components like load balancers and how the web and these devices interact.

The tone of the book is friendly and easy to follow (typical of O'Reilly books) and its easy to crack open a section and skim through that to get useful information quickly.

The book is a little on the long side, though I don't think I'd want it to be shorter. This can make it appear at first glance to be intimidating, but tone removes that barrier quickly.

Magdy Saeb,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cryptographic Algorithms on Reconfigurable Hardware (Signals and Communication Technology),What is missing here?,"Real-time applications of cryptography require that the processing delays are to be minimized. Therefore, hardware implementation is considered indispensable for this type of applications. In this respect, concepts of cryptographic micro-architectures for real-time data encryption employing Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) are well-explained in this book. The book, as its name implies, discusses algorithms that are to minimize time, area and power consumption. As a matter of fact, this is the first book, as far as I know, that deals with the new evolving area of cryptographic FPGA implementations. It can be helpful to understand the basics of this new discipline along with another book on Cryptographic Engineering edited by one of the authors of Cryptographic Algorithms. However, what is missing here is sample implementations with extended discussions. I found the book to be an interesting introduction to the subject but will hardly help practicing engineers in their design efforts of Cryptographic FPGA Implementations. In a sense the book neglects what its major audience need to find in it . Design engineers need to find some solutions of the problems they are facing in implementing cryptographic algorithms.",1
William Thompson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Structural Information Theory: The Simplicity of Visual Form,"Plato, here is your answer","This is an excellent, well written book which I highly recommend to readers interested in perception and who want to understand what Structural Information Theory has to say about it. Also those who are looking for an in depth and up to date complete reference on SIT will find this book valuable.

SIT explains on a computational level the way that the human visual system organizes raw visual stimulus into a structural model of a scene or distal stimulus. This is a very important book in light of the questions of perception that have been a great mystery for centuries (ie The Allegory of the Cave). This book is well organized with a clear presentation of the problems motivating perception research and clearly defining the purpose of the book and SIT itself. Don't expect any extended explanations involving neurons or brain maps, this book is about the theory at the computational level, in reference to Marr's Vision: A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information three levels of description. The material is somewhat difficult and abstract, this is not a casual read. My experience with the book is that the explanations are as clear as could be expected given the abstract nature of the material, however I found it well worth working through the chapters to eventually gain an understanding of how SIT explains the computational solution to perception. In my opinion SIT is a very viable theory, and offers a very convincing core explanation: that the unconscious process which determines structure from visual stimuli works by way of seeking the simplest structure, even though its not always the correct structure (hence visual illusions).",1
Head Cheeze,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Complete Digital Photography, Third Edition (Charles River Media Graphics)",The best out of nearly two dozen titles on the subject!,"In 2011 alone, I've purchased the entire Kelby collection, an assortment of Peterson's books, Freeman's collection (which, to be fair, are geared more toward the ""art and psychology"" side of photography than meant as any sort of style guide or how-to), and a host of others, but Long's Complete Digital Photography is easily my favorite book of the lot of 'em. It's more than just a basic photography book - this thing is a DSLR Bible that covers virtually every aspect of the art and science of digital photography. Prior to receiving this book, I'd watched a series of videos featuring Long, and really enjoyed his plain-English teaching style as well as his infectious sense of humor as it makes going back over the ""basics"" (I actually studied photography in college, back in ""ye ol' film days"")a breeze, and learning more advanced techniques less daunting. While several of my books from some of the ""bigger"" names in photography have either been returned for store credit at Amazon or given away to fellow noobs to the world of DSLR photography, Long's book is one I'll be sure to keep around for regular reference, and it's the one I recommend to anyone who asks me what I think is the most comprehensive-yet-user-friendly resource on the subject.

G. Avvinti,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Complete Digital Photography, Third Edition (Charles River Media Graphics)",Really Complete introduction in a single book,"If I had to suggest a single book providing a Complete introduction to digital photography, I would have no doubt to go with this book. As an introduction it perfectly fits the need as it succeeds in covering virtually all of the topics faced when going digital (and not only) without leaving the impression of being too superficial. Of course it can be deemed to be Complete in absolute terms and in depth coverage of each single topic, that'd be impossible in a single book. One of the greatest pleasure of (digital) photography is that it's the sum of several broad topics that well worth being explored individually: if you think of Composition, Exposure, Lightning, Post-Production, you'll soon find that the literature provides dozens of books specifically dedicated to each of them. That's why putting all this together is a complex endeavor and requires a careful thinking and organization.

Going into some more detail about the book's organization, I particularly appreciated the underlying idea. So much that I couldn't tell it better than the author himself: ""[...] we've been studying the theory behind all the different parameters that affect the creation of an image, as well as the controls that you have for manipulating those parameters. I have been calling this the craft of photography. Photographic artistry is the process of using these craft skills to represent a scene--whether it's a portrait, still life, event, landscape, or abstract--in a way that evokes some of what the subject makes you feel."" And indeed, as an amateur, I feel the compelling need to improve in both, something in which the book proved helpful. Moreover, I was completely new to post production and through this book I got the necessary fundamentals. As rough figures, keep into account the book has the first 300 pages about dedicated to everything involved in getting the image in your camera and some 270 following pages talking about images management and post-production. It's not everything you should know about this, but they're definitely enough to start with.

On the specifics, it was kind of a very appreciated surprise reading the topic in the first chapter (""Eyes, Braing, Light and Images"", i.e. how we see) as well as the chapter on composition and the idea that to improve in this the first need is to Learn to See (or gain back again this lost capability we had as children). As a computer scientist, of course I found interesting the coverage of the technological aspects that lie behind the whole process of acquiring an image.

Looking for similar books, my personal experience has brought in my hands two other interesting books, namely Dickman and Kinghorn's Perfect Digital Photography(Second edition) and Michael Freeman's Pro Photographer's D-SLR Handbook (A Lark Photography Book), which would respectively be my second and third in place alternatives. (Note however that Michael Freeman easily gets back on the throne with his other many excellent books, including bestsellers like The Photographer's Eye: Composition and Design for Better Digital Photos and The Photographer's Mind: Creative Thinking for Better Digital Photos).",13

It has 22 comprehensive chapters covering the theory and practice of photography, cameras, workflow, and several very detailed chapters on how to modify your pictures with Adobe Photoshop. Why spend money on an expensive correspondence course or online class when you can get all the information you need from this book? It is not the kind of book that you can read in one sitting, with your feet up and sipping a glass of wine. However, if you are a good reader and read this book in sections as your photography skills develop, you will become a better and more knowledgeable photographer.

It deserves nothing less than 5 stars! Ben Long's Complete Digital Photography is about as complete as complete can be! I don't think the author left a single stone unturned. The book is laid out well making the text easier to understand and follow. The author begins by detailing the differences between the way the human eye sees a scene and the way the camera sees that very scene. He then describes the different functions/features on digital cameras and how to use these functions/features to take better pictures or make things easier. After that a few chapters about the creative aspect of photography to teach you how to make your photographs more appealing. The remainder of the book has instructions and tutorials to teach you how to use Adobe Photoshop to edit your photographs and Adobe Bridge to help you organize, sort, evaluate and rank your photographs.

Before I read this book, I knew nothing about the different functions of digital cameras or how to use them effectively. But I also didn't have a full understanding of exposure and the different parameters that can be adjusted to fine tune exposures for a variety of scenes and/or situations. The author repeats several times throughout the book how the 4 adjustable elements related to a good exposure can be manipulated in a variety of situations. I feel that now I do have a good understanding of exposure. Now I just need to apply it to the variety of situations and make it part of me while most of it is still fresh in my memory.

One of the most intriguing aspects of digital photography is the opportunity to get creative after you take the picture in a way that was just not possible for most shooters with film. there are many inexpensive, and expensive, digital editing programs available that anyone with a basic PC can take advantage of, Complete Digital Photography takes you through the options and provides a good overview of how to make your shots yours.

The included cd includes trial versions of many of the applications referenced in the book as well as sample files for the examples used in the book.

Someone with experience with digital SLRs and Photoshop will likely find this book a waste of time and will be looking for more specialised books that dig deeper into specific areas. For the vast majority of readers Complete Digital Photography will provide an interesting and thorough overview of digital photography.",25

Jason Sheets,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Complete Digital Photography, Third Edition (Charles River Media Graphics)",Excellent photography / digital camera instruction,"I have purchased this book twice, it is an introduction to digital photography, particularly for the fixed lense Nikon SLR cameras (such as the 8700) and SLR digital cameras. If you have a simple point and click camera you will get some benefit from the book but not as much.

The book provides a photography primer, clearly explains terms, and gets the reader excited about taking pictures.

Additionally it discusses SLR and non SLR cameras, and digital photo processing using Photoshop (a good portion of this book is dedicated to this task, roughly 40%).

This is a great gift for the person just getting into digital photography or someone looking to expand their skills and knowledge.",19
Alan Montgomery,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Complete Digital Photography, Third Edition (Charles River Media Graphics)",Has Been Very Helpful Just Getting Started,"I got started in photography fairly recently. I have watched all of Ben Long's videos on the lynda website and was excited to see he had a HUGE book that went more in depth to all his teachings.

The book is laid out in a very logic flow that introduces you to some background, teaches you the key terms, then starts into what makes a good picture and how to take one. He even goes into post processing techniques and printing techniques so it really it a start to finish sort of guide.

Along with the The Digital Photography Book, Volume 1, these two books should be required reading for everyone starting out in photography.",1
N/A,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Complete Digital Photography, Third Edition (Charles River Media Graphics)",Lots of detail; well written,"I am a beginner to Photography. I have owned a auto 35mm Pentax IQ zoom for about 5 years and then went on to buy a Kodak DC290 in 2000. I am now thinking of upgrading to a 'prosumer' or a SLR kind of digital camera. I had a small, limited background of apertures and shutter speeds, from what I have heard from my father (he had an old Yashika).
Given my background, this book has been a wealth of information for me. The author doesn't beat around the bush, and give lenghty anecdotes - the book is very precise, with lots and lots of information - about photography in general, and the book never once veers from the main topic - digital cameras and digital photography. If you are shopping for a camera like me, if not for anything else, you can get this book just for Chapter 5 - 'Choosing a Digital Camera'. You can make a check list of things you want in your camera, cross-check with dpreview.com and get the camera that has it all that you want! And the good thing is, it doesn't get too pedantic - there are practical illustrations and common usage tips.
All in all a fantastic book for beginners. On the negative side - the book doesn't seem to have been thoroughly proof-read. There are typos, one reference to a wrong illustration and minor grammatical errors. Also the illustrations in the book do not always bring out what the author is trying to say (limited colors?) - you have to refer to the jpeg's in the accompanying CD.",19

He references his own publications in the field well over 100 times in this book. This book is probably the most comprehensive collection of psychoacoustical information I have seen to date. As with all works, it starts with a description of sound and the human audiotory system, and then moves into how the two entities interact and how perception is modeled by this. The discussion is very technical, and he has an average of one graph per page. I do not recommend this book to anyone not interested in the details of how psychoacoustics evolve.
It is also nice that he includes a methods section, as one would do in a technical journal. This describes how the data that he is presenting was obtained, and adds a load of credibilty to the work. Also most of the data presented is empirical, from experiments themselves. The amount of research underlying this work is huge.

""Biological Information: New Perspectives"" is one of the books that I have purchased in order to get my questions answered and to discover the truth about biology and the controversies associated with it.

This is another book that I can add to my defense arsenal to protect me against the vicious attacks of the Atheistic Darwinists.

Add the book ""Genetic Entropy"" by John C. Sanford into the mix, and you will have a good start towards discovering what cutting-edge Biological Research is all about! Or, you can continue to read Richard Dawkins' books which are based completely upon the Biological Sciences that we had 40 years ago! Richard Dawkins hasn't done any scientific research for over 40 years. Richard Dawkins is at least half a century behind the times when it comes to his scientific knowledge. In my humble opinion, you want the PhDs doing the cutting-edge scientific research here and now as your teachers and your guides, and NOT Richard Dawkins' fifty-year-old regurgitated tripe.

Answering Questions:

I was mocked for suggesting that almost everything that you see around you is a LIVING FOSSIL (20 of the 23 major phyla that exist today and that you can see around you were planted fully formed with NO evolutionary precursors during the Cambrian Explosion) -- the person called me an idiot and told me that there were no bunnies in the Cambrian Explosion.

My Response:

It can actually be a very fun and interesting exercise to determine which of the phyla were here BEFORE the Cambrian Explosion (2 or so), which of the phyla came during the Cambrian Explosion and eventually went extinct (at least 16 and certainly more), which phyla came during the Cambrian Explosion and have remained unchanged ever since and are currently LIVING FOSSILS (at least 20 and certainly more), and which phyla came AFTER the Cambrian Explosion in the Devonian Explosion (2 phyla) and other explosions that took place when the Gods planted additional phyla onto this earth.

The mammals are one of the last phyla that the Gods planted onto this earth, so no Virginia, you will not find any cute bunnies during the Cambrian Explosion. The Gods were busy preparing this earth for man, their offspring, during the Cambrian and Devonian Explosions.

When it comes to this subject, you have to choose to use your brains and not let your ignorance blind you.

Each phylum (or major animal group) comes onto the scene instantaneously with NO evolutionary precursors, fully developed and fully formed, and it remains basically the same with only minor speciation for millions of years until it finally goes extinct. That's what the fossil record tells us.

When we have all gone extinct, the Gods will have to come and plant the place once again, if they want to. The WHOLE THING is moving towards extinction thanks to Evolution and Random Mutations! There is NO forward evolution taking place -- no forward evolution caused by Natural Selection and Random Mutations. That is the message of the Cambrian and the Devonian Explosions! Natural Selection and Random Mutations CANNOT produce forward evolution. Random Mutations can only accelerate our extinction.

You want to use your brains when it comes to this subject.

The Official Motto of the Evolutionists and Atheists: Kill the messenger to hide your ignorance.

A person asked something to this effect: ""If all of the evolutionists are liars, then where does Meyer, Sanford, Rana, Wells, Sarfati, and the hundreds of other honest PhDs and scientists get their data?""

My Response:

They get their scientific data and scientific evidence from the former Atheists, Evolutionists, and Darwinists who are NOT liars and cheats.

Actually, Biology Scientists and Biology PhDs like John C. Sanford, Fazale Rana, Jonathan Wells, and Michael Denton get their scientific data from doing actual scientific research of their own! Stephen Meyer tends to get his scientific data from them.

I still think that Michael Denton IS an atheist -- but he was a research biologist in micro-biology when he wrote his first book exposing the flaws in the theory of evolution. Michael Denton was just an honest atheist and an honest scientist. John C. Sanford started as an atheist and an evolutionist, but decades of actual scientific research taught him that the Theory of Evolution is fundamentally flawed. John Sanford created the gene gun and genetic engineering, and John Sanford retired off the funds he got when he sold his two biotech companies. Johathan Wells was an evolutionist and a Darwinist until his PhD graduate program in Embryology, when he discovered that the Evolutionists have been lying to us for the past 150 years. His teaching professors admitted that they knew about the lies, but still used the lies in their classrooms to preach Evolution. Jonathan Wells had a choice -- to either join with them or to expose the truth. He chose to expose the truth. Fazale Rana was and is a biology researcher doing real actual science in the field.

What Meyer does is to hire Biology Scientists and then instructs them to find the truth. That's where Meyer gets his data from.

It's not magic. It's common sense.

Once you divorce your emotions from your religion, The Theory of Evolution, you will suddenly see that it is so.

That's what happened to me. I used to be an atheist until I saw the light and the truth.

The Official Motto of the Evolutionists and Atheists: Kill the messenger to hide your ignorance.

Some of the Atheists and Evolutionists that I encountered online were doing brutal mockery, libel, slander, and denigration of John C. Sanford, Michael Denton, Stephen Meyer, Jonathan Wells, Gerald Shroeder, Hugh Ross, Fazale Rana, Jonathan Sarfati, and many other scientists and PhDs.

The Atheists and Evolutionists can’t kill the Intelligent Design message and can’t debunk the Intelligent Design message, so they have to try to kill and destroy the messenger, which they attempt to do over and over again until it gets extremely pointless and old. The Atheists and Evolutionists and Darwinists engage in smear campaigns against their opponents in an attempt to hide their own ignorance. It’s deflection of the most petty and worthless kind. It’s infantile and puerile. But, it’s what they do. They really have no choice, because the scientific evidence itself has turned against them! The Evolutionists and Atheists can’t win on the merits of the case, so they have to kill the messengers to hide their ignorance and to try to hide the fact that they have already lost.

The Atheists and Evolutionists and Darwinists engage in smear campaigns because they have something that they are trying to hide from the rest of us. They have been deliberately and knowingly lying to us for the past 150 years. That definitely gives them something to hide!

It’s no mystery that I have lost respect for them.

The other day, I had an atheistic youngster trying to use some Atheism 101 on me -- name-calling, splitting hairs, deception, sleight-of-hand, bigotry, and selective amnesia. The Atheists and Darwinists try to get you staring at gnats in the hope that you will somehow swallow the camel whole -- the ""camel"" being the falsehoods associated with the Theory of Evolution.

This atheistic youngster thought that he had found the smoking gun when he discovered that Jonathan Wells was a theologian BEFORE Jonathan Wells discovered the falsehoods associated with the Theory of Evolution, as if being a theologian magically makes a person incapable of seeing and understanding the truths and falsehoods within Science. The Atheists and Darwinists believe in a lot of magic and mythology with a blind faith that rivals and at times exceeds the blind faith of Religious Fanatics. Extremism of any kind, whether it's Radical Fundamentalism or Militant Atheism, is dangerous and harmful to society.

This atheistic youngster got a few of his facts wrong and exposed his ignorance once again while doing so.

The greatest Scientists I know are theologians, and many of them became theologians AFTER their Scientific Research started pointing them to God. But, in Jonathan Wells' case, as discussed in his autobiography at the start of his book, ""Icons of Evolution"", he was a theologian BEFORE he discovered that the Darwinists have been lying to us for the past 150 years. So, what's wrong with that? Nothing!

So, sit back and let this old man tell you how things used to be back in the day.

Thirty-five years ago, BEFORE the microbiologists doing cutting-edge scientific research proved the Theory of Evolution false, we ALL were evolutionists, or at least had to pretend to be if we wanted to pass our college exams. Back in 1980, I asked my Biology Professor, a Christian, about the Theory of Evolution. He told me that it was true and that I had to believe in it, because there was no other explanation for the scientific evidence. And, back in 1980, he was right. The microbiologists, such as Michael Denton, didn't start to prove the Theory of Evolution false until the mid-1980's. I was ten years too early with my questions. Back then, we ALL were evolutionists and Darwinists. We had no choice. Yes, some of the people around me were Theistic Evolutionists or Evolutionistic Theologians, but they were still evolutionists! We had to be, because there wasn't anything better at the time.

A Theistic Evolutionist believes that GOD used evolution, through natural selection and random mutations, to create the life forms on this planet.

Now, if my atheistic youngster friend will read Jonathan Wells' biography a bit more carefully, he will notice that Jonathan Wells was a Theistic Evolutionist, a theologian AND a believer in Darwinism and evolution, BEFORE his Phd program in Embryology where he discovered that the Atheistic Darwinists have been lying to us for the past 150 years.

It doesn't really matter whether Jonathan Wells was, or was not, a theologian before he discovered the falsehoods of the Theory of Evolution. All that really matters is that he finally discovered the truth!

In my case, and in the case of Lee Strobel, Antony Flew, Edward Feser, John C. Sanford, and hundreds of other scientists, WE were atheists before we discovered that the Darwinists and Atheists have been lying to us for the past 150 years. We were Atheistic Evolutionists, which is the exact same thing as being a Theistic Evolutionist, because every Evolutionist has been successfully tricked and deceived by the Darwinists into believing that the Theory of Evolution is true.

This same atheistic youngster asked me to show him one deception or lie that the Atheistic Darwinists perpetrated against us. I pointed him to ""Icons of Evolution"" by Jonathan Wells, because it contains at least a dozen.

The study of Science is a learning process, or at least it should be.

I have discovered dozens of different books in which the lies of the Atheistic Darwinists and Atheistic Materialists are successfully exposed for all the world to see.

""The Unofficial Guide to Cosmos: Fact and Fiction in Neil deGrasse Tyson's Landmark Science Series"" by David Klinghoffer is one such book.

""Debating Darwin's Doubt: A Scientific Controversy That Can No Longer Be Denied"" by David Klinghoffer is another.

""Total Truth (Study Guide Edition - Trade Paperback): Liberating Christianity from Its Cultural Captivity"" by Nancy Pearcey exposes the lies of Evolution while revealing the truth to you.

""Biological Information: New Perspectives"" IS a massive science book containing peer-reviewed science articles from 29 PhD scientists, which expose the lies and inadequacies found in the Theory of Evolution.

""Genetic Entropy"" by John C. Sanford is an excellent book that explains very clearly and in simple terms how Natural Selection and Random Mutations are totally inadequate when it comes time to produce NEW biologial information, new genes, new biological designs, new genomes, and new life forms. Science itself has proven that Natural Selection and Random Mutations are not sufficient to the task of creating whole new life forms, not even from the existing life forms that God has already created for us. It requires an Intelligent Genetic Engineer to do such a thing; and, that is Artificial Selection or Man-Made Selection and NOT Natural Selection. Random Mutations can't guide or build anything! The ONLY thing that Random Mutations can do is to slowly guide us towards our eventual extinction, because Random Mutations cause genetic degredation!

""Evolution: A Theory in Crisis"" by Michael Denton was the first Science Book to successfully expose me to the falsehoods in the Theory of Evolution; but unfortunately for me, it wasn't until 1996 that I first read the book, and it was the ONLY book of its kind that I could find at the time. So, I remained an evolutionist, just as Michael Denton remained an evolutionist -- although by that point in time, I was starting to question the Theory of Evolution, just as he was.

""Icons of Evoluton"" by Jonathan Wells should really have been called, ""The Lies of Evolution"", because that is what that book exposes for public scrutiny.

There are literally dozens of different books now that expose the lies and deceptions of the Atheistic Darwinists. You just have to be willing to look for them, find them, and read them. The truth is out there now!",4

It makes a good case that biological life is not only matter plus energy, rather that information is at the heart of biological life, just as much as matter and energy. One of the aspects of information is its unpredictability from natural causes. For example, the traces left by the Great Bonneville Flood require no information for explanation despite the fact that its length and size left a rather complex record, everything can be explained from just matter and energy, but even the simplest of living organisms have a type of complexity that makes it unpredictable from natural causes, so unpredictable that the probability is virtually nil from natural causes.

EK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Discover Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics: A Playful Way of Discovering a Law of Nature,Excellent book for both a general reader and a scientist,"I have two views on this excellent book (or envision two uses of it, if you wish). I put them down separately below, for a general reader and for a physical chemistry teacher:

1. A note for a reader interested in understanding of the key principle of nature in the most efficient way
-------------------------------------------------------------
This book helps you approach the most confusing (and misinterpreted) concepts in thermodynamics: entropy and the Second Law. The author designed a series of simulation-games, which are easy to picture or actually reproduce to observe results (the website also has simulations to view). The results lead you to building your own feel for why spontaneous changes occur in systems with many particles. You, generally, do not need math to find that out--only enough imagination.

As I just mentioned, this book is not giving you a mathematical route to definitions of Second Law and entropy but, rather, helps you harness your common sense for this task. Indeed, everything what we see around and know obeys the Second Law. This book helps you to use your natural, observer's knowledge for what the law of spontaneous change is to grasp its details, presented in an easy context of games of marbles. In a later section the author translates the ""language of marbles"" into terms of physics and thermodynamics.

This book is very much like a real scientific study the author guides the reader through. If you are looking for entertainment book or an accessible general-overview text, this a wrong book to pick. To fully experience a joy of discovery of the most fundamental principle in Nature you will have to use some patience to sit through all exercises (games) designed by the author. There are no statements like ""trivial to show""--the author truly leads you step-by-step and you never lose feeling that this journey is all still ""under your control"".

Most important feeling I had after I was done with these exercises: no more fog or mystery is left around the concept of entropy and its meaning for me.

2. A note for a teacher of Physical Chemistry
------------------------------------------------
I would like to mention one important application of the approach presented in this book. I am teaching a Physical Chemistry class for Biology majors. The thermodynamics and, specifically, entropy are the most confusing parts for my students. They generally try to ""endure"" this discussion, learn to reproduce the relationships for the exam--only to happily forget them as soon as they can afterwards. In my opinion, this is because all thermodynamics is taught in a historical prospective, asking a student to follow its 400-year-long track. This is natural but not the most productive way of teaching this important science. Modern students are already accustomed to thinking that the matter is atomistic, they have general sense of what probability and information is. Why don't we use this background to advantage of their learning?

The author of this book designed an easy-to-follow scheme of delivering the ideas of spontaneous change leading to formulation of the Second Law. The entropy comes as an application of Shannon's Measure of Information to thermodynamics of atomistic matter. I believe, this type of discussion coupled with Maxwell's kinetic theory of gases should precede topics of thermodynamics. This is what I am trying to implement in my own teaching.",5
Bob Hanlon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Discover Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics: A Playful Way of Discovering a Law of Nature,A simple but powerful approach to explaining entropy,"As a Chemical Engineer, I've always had a difficult time fully understanding the concept of entropy. I was taught this concept from the Classical Thermodynamics point of view and learned how to effectively use it to solve problems associated with, for example, chemical reaction and phase equilibria. However, I never really understood what I was doing from a molecular standpoint. Hence my resulting excitement at reading this wonderful book.

Inspired by the work of Claude Shannon, Arieh Ben-Naim created a set of very clever computer simulations involving marbles and boxes to visually demonstrate - - - very good and colorful figures, by the way - - - the link between Information Theory and the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. Especially instructive to me was seeing how the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution easily evolves from this simple and yet very powerful approach. Ben-Naim's patience is carefully walking me, the reader, through this demonstration and also through a discussion about how these results relate to the 2nd Law, including a visually-enhanced discussion of how the slope of the entropy-energy curve corresponds to inverse-temperature as per Clausius' equation dS = dQ/T, was very much welcomed.

I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to truly understand what entropy really is.",1
Charles Hooper,4.0 out of 5 stars,Oracle SQL Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach (Expert's Voice in Oracle),Answering the Question - What can I do with SQL? A Handful of Errors Tarnish a Great Book,"Last November I pre-ordered this book, hoping that it would pick up where the ""Mastering Oracle SQL and SQL*Plus"" book ended (at roughly Oracle Database release 10.1.0.3). The expectations were very high, and this book delivers for the most part. Some parts of the book left me scratching my head, thinking that this SQL statement or paragraph just cannot be correct. Even when taking those sections into account, this book conveys a significant amount of practical, useful information.

The book's format of problem statement, solution, and how/why the solution works is the key to the success of this book. You will not find page after page of SQL statement syntax. The range of problem statements covered in this compact 500 page book is impressive, touching on a wide range of topics:
* Basic SELECT statements
* Manipulating numbers, dates, and character data
* Transaction management
* XML data
* Partitioning
* Analytic functions
* Regular expressions
* Performance tuning
* Database troubleshooting
* Creating databases, tablespaces, tables, indexes, and constraints

Positives:
* Thoroughly answers the question of why it is important to learn Oracle's dialect of SQL. The book provides 233 problem situations, most with more than one variation of the problem along with the SQL statement for each variation.
* Includes interesting side stories that are not necessarily related to SQL coding, but help to keep the reader interested in the book contents. For example, a side story titled ""Beer and Statistics Do Mix"" that describes the invention of T-Tests.
* Typically states when a feature requires the Enterprise Edition or an additional cost license beyond the Enterprise Edition (Tuning Pack, for example).
* Most, if not all of the code samples from the book may be downloaded from the Apress website.
* Describes the LEAD, LAG, RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, SUM, MIN, MAX, NTILE and a couple of the other common analytic functions. Does not cover all of the analytic functions, for example: RATIO_TO_REPORT, FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, PERCENTILE_DISC, etc.
* Recipe 5-8 shows how to create a PL/SQL function that converts from base 10 to binary, octal, and hex.
* Recipe 11-9 shows an impressive example that creates a HTML chart from a SQL statement. It might be interesting to see this example extended to use floating objects with absolute positioning rather than HTML tables.
* Recipes 12-3 and 12-4 include PL/SQL functions that help to determine if a VARCHAR2 value can be safely converted to a NUMBER or DATE.

Problems (in order, not all code samples were tested):
* In recipe 1-1, retrieving data from a table, the authors mentioned ""currently set schema,"" a concept which probably would have been much better to introduce in a later recipe. Especially in the early sections of the book, it seems that the authors struggled with what concepts to introduce early and what concepts required a more establish foundation. As such, people just learning SQL, or even just Oracle's dialect, will struggle with the early sections of the book.
* Several recipes (1-4, 2-11, 2-14, 2-15, 2-16, 6-5, 6-14) use implicit date conversions, or explicit varchar to date conversions without specifying the format of the date contained in the varchar. This is a very poor practice to teach to people who are just beginning the process of learning SQL. A change in the NLS parameters, or even a change in the connection method from Oracle's ODBC driver to Oracle's OLEDB driver is sufficient to cause such SQL statements to fail. Unfortunately, the TO_DATE function was not introduced until chapter 6.
* Page 26 incorrectly stated, ""for performance reasons, Oracle will implicitly sort the data to match the grouping desired."" As of Oracle Database 10.1, more often than not a hashing algorithm will be used to perform GROUP BY operations, which means that there will be no implicit sort of the data.
* Recipe 3-5 attempted to explain when to use three different syntaxes to delete rows from a table (IN, EXISTS, and SELECT with USING clause). As may be confirmed with a 10053 trace file, the optimizer will often automatically re-write SQL statements from one form to another, for example from an IN clause to a standard join, or an EXISTS clause to a standard join. The authors probably should have mentioned the automatic query re-write capability of the cost-based optimizer, rather than stating something like this about an EXISTS clause example ""this is not as elegant as the first solution, but might be more efficient.""
* Recipe 5-11 demonstrates how to use the FOR UPDATE clause of a SELECT statement and demonstrates that the second session will be blocked until the first session commits or issues a rollback. At this stage of the book the NOWAIT clause is not introduced. Unfortunately, such a demonstration might be an invitation to ""lost"" updates.
* The query output for recipe 6-6 does not match the expected output, which may lead to confusion. The book shows that the result of the timezone conversion is ""13-AUG-09 06.00.00.000000 PM AMERICA/LOS_ANGELES"" when it should be ""13-AUG-09 06.25.00.000000 PM AMERICA/LOS_ANGELES""
* Recipe 6-12, which uses the EXTRACT function, will produce incorrect/unexpected results, resulting in the MONTHS calculation increasing by one up to 15 days earlier than should be expected if used to determine the length of time an employee has worked. That recipe would have been the perfect time to introduce the MONTHS_BETWEEN SQL function (not included in the book).
* Recipe 7-1 states that Oracle will never use a non-function based index on a column when that column appears inside the INSTR function that is present in a WHERE clause. That statement is incorrect, a hint, covered in recipe 19-12, is sufficient to allow Oracle to perform an index full scan operation on that column when the only predicate in the WHERE clause includes that index's column wrapped in an INSTR function (tested on Oracle releases 10.2.0.4 through 11.2.0.1).
* Recipe 8-2 states, ""With the value one-third stored in each column (BINARY_DOUBLE and NUMBER datatypes), we can use the VSIZE function to show it was much more complicated to store this with decimal precision, taking nearly three times the space."" There are a couple of problems with this statement. First, a BINARY_DOUBLE column will always require eight bytes to store any number, while it takes a variable amount of space to store a number in a NUMBER column (for instance, the number 1,000,000 requires fewer bytes to store than the number 333). Second, the BINARY_DOUBLE column only maintained 16 significant digits to the right of the decimal point, while the NUMBER column maintained 40 significant digits to the right of the decimal point (the bytes required can be decreased by specifying a smaller number of significant digits to the right of the decimal point).
* Recipe 8-6 states ""The final two implicit defaults (of a CREATE SEQUENCE clause) cause Oracle to cache 20 values and not force strict first-come, first served ordering on those who call NEXTVAL."" This statement is either misleading or incorrect. The default will force the sequence numbers to be assigned to calling sessions in the sequential order specified by CREATE SEQUENCE - Oracle will not provide the numbers out of sequential order. There can be some degree of out of sequential order assignment in a RAC environment.
* Recipe 9-2, which includes a SQL statement that is intended to show the objects which are locked that are blocking other sessions, has a number of problems. 1) It is not RAC aware - it should be selecting from the GV$ views, rather than the V$ views. 2) The SQL statement explicitly looks for the BLOCK column to be equal to 1 - in a RAC environment it could potentially show a value of 2. 3) When performing a self-join on V$LOCK, the query is only joining on the ID1 column of V$LOCK, while the documentation shows a self-join on that view using the ID1, ID2, and TYPE columns. 4) There appears to be a missing join condition between V$LOCK and V$LOCKED_OBJECT that results in objects being identified as contributing to the blocking of the second session, when in fact that may not be the case. 5) The query seems to assume that all locks acquired are full table locks.
* Page 436 suggests checking Metalink (My Oracle Support) Doc ID 555284.1 for a script to identify indexes that should be rebuilt. I suspect that that document looked very different prior to the last modification date of May 13, 2009. The script in the document does not detect indexes that are candidates for a rebuild - the script simply outputs SQL statements to rebuild every index that is not owned by SYS or SYSTEM (and a small number of other users) into an INDX tablespace with a specified initial, next, and maxextents clause.
* Recipe 18-13, in the Note section, states that when a primary key constraint is created Oracle will create a unique index with the same name as the constraint. That statement is true unless a unique or non-unique index already exists for the column or a composite index that has that column as its leading column exists. Later in the recipe it was stated that the DBA could pre-create the index that will be used to help enforce the primary key constraint, but the Note section might cause a little confusion.
* Recipe 19-1, the join between V$SQL_MONITOR and V$SQL is incomplete and will result in repeated rows if there are multiple child cursors for a SQL_ID, which seems to happen frequently starting with Oracle Database 11.1.0.6 due to adaptive cursor sharing, and 11.2.0.1 due to cardinality feedback. Additionally, V$SQL_MONITOR will only be populated if the CONTROL_MANAGEMENT_PACK_ACCESS initialization parameter is set to DIAGNOSTIC+TUNING to enable the extra cost licenses (Tuning Pack, for example).
* Recipe 19-3 states ""the V$SESSION_LONGOPS view gives you a rough idea of how long a currently running query has left to finish."" Technically, this statement is both correct and incorrect. The view provides a rough idea, based on the execution plan estimates, of how much time is left for a specific stage (step/line) in the execution plan. Entries in the V$SESSION_LONGOPS view will appear and disappear as the different stages in the execution plan execute. Most index type accesses will likely complete in less than six seconds per access, and probably will not appear in this view.
* Recipe 19-4, the query may produce misleading results as the query is not time-scoped. The query does not consider that the database may have been up for several years - a query that on average consumes one second of CPU time, but was executed 100 million times since the library cache was last purged will likely be flagged as a problem, while a query that on average consumes 1,000 seconds of CPU time but has only executed 1,000 times in the last 24 hours probably will not appear in the SQL results.
* Recipe 19-7 states that a PLAN_TABLE must exist, and that if it does not exist the utlxplan.sql script should be run to create a PLAN_TABLE in the user's schema. As of Oracle Database 10.1.0.1 user schemas should no longer have a PLAN_TABLE in their schema - a global temporary table owned by the SYS user is used instead.
* Chapter 19 demonstrates the use of EXPLAIN PLAN, AUTOTRACE, and the EXPLAIN option of TKPROF, but the chapter does not mention that using those methods for displaying the execution plan could show the wrong execution plan.
* Recipes 19-10 and 19-12 suggest that a goal of tuning is reducing the calculated COST value that appears in the execution plan, and this was accomplished in the recipes by adding an index or using an index hint. This is not a good approach to tuning; it is much better to rely on actual response time rather than the calculated cost estimates.
* Recipe 20-1, the SQL statements are not time-scoped, and even if the database has only been open for a short period of time, the SQL statement could yield incorrect results because the ""CPU used by this session"" statistic is not updated in real-time, only when a SQL statement completes, or a fetch completes.
* Page 500 suggests inspecting V$SESSION to determine the type of block contention that causes buffer busy waits. It would have been nice to see the authors provide a demonstration of this technique because from what I am able to determine, the chances of a success are extremely small using V$SESSION (I assume that the authors might be suggesting to look at either the combination of P1, P2, and P3 or the combination of ROW_WAIT_OBJ#, ROW_WAIT_FILE#, and ROW_WAIT_BLOCK#).
* Page 500 states that the ""SQL*Net message from client"" wait event indicates possible network or middle-tier bottlenecks. Client-side ""think time"" is probably the most significant contributor to this wait event, and I think that it would be very difficult to demonstrate that this wait event indicates network bottlenecks.
* Recipe 20-8 suggests an approach to identify those indexes that are safe to drop by enabling monitoring of the indexes. One of the problems with this approach is that the index may still be used by the cost-based optimizer even when monitoring reveals that the index is never used.
* Very few cross-recipe (forward and backward) references were provided, which makes the sections of the book appear to be disconnected and stand-alone.

The book attempts to cover a lot of ground. While it probably requires the authors between one and eight hours per page to research, write, proof-read, test, and format a typical page in an Apress book, the authors probably could have controlled the scope of the book a little better and spent a little more time to test and expand some of the sections of the book - the sections that discuss analytic functions, for example. I did not spend a lot of time reading through the chapters ""Working with XML Data"", ""Partitioning"", or ""LOBS"", so I did not comment on those sections of the book. The majority of the book is exceptional - far better than any book that is strictly a SQL reference type book, and I would not hesitate to recommend the book to others who are trying to figure out: ""What do I do with SQL.""",3
Mr. Robert V. Darling,5.0 out of 5 stars,Oracle SQL Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach (Expert's Voice in Oracle),The right recipe,"I have read through this book just about from end to end and found it invaluable.

As an 'old hand' large scale mainframe system developer that came back into development just a few years back after pursuing a successful career in another field - this book really gave me considerable insight into Oracle.

The 'How it Works' explanations of the examples should be part of every technical book - and so dispell the mystery that often surrounds technical subject material.

I am currently also working through Steve Feuerstein's PL/SLQ definitive reference and the two really do complement each other for somebody who is coming to the subject with a wealth of legacy database system expertise who is looking to find out how to best make use of what is available today.

I would love to see other books constructed in the same format - for example, for the various programming languages such as Java - books that give examples of the everyday sort of things that you have to do.

Consistency is pre-requisite to Clarity and the book is consistent in its approach throughout.

Charles Hooper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pro Oracle SQL (Expert's Voice in Oracle),"Hard-Hitting, Beyond the Basics Advice for Breaking the Black Box Approach to Database Programming, Leveraging the SQL Language","Hard-Hitting, Beyond the Basics Advice for Breaking the Black Box Approach to Database Programming, Leveraging the SQL Language on Oracle Database, and Improving Overall Performance of the SQL that You Write

I pre-ordered this book in October 2010 while searching for a way to learn some of the more advanced features of Oracle Database's SQL; I have been searching for a follow up book to the ""Mastering Oracle SQL and SQL*Plus"" book that I read a couple of years ago, and I think that I finally found that follow up book. Written as the Oracle Database 11.2 sequel to the book ""Mastering Oracle SQL and SQL*Plus"" (and that book's much updated revision titled ""Beginning Oracle SQL""), this book is not written as a simple reference for the Oracle specific SQL dialect. This is not a book that you will want to use when trying to learn the basics of creating a simple SQL statement with a four table join. However, if you are able to create that simple SQL statement with a four table join in less than 30 minutes with the help of an entity-relationship diagram (ERD), and without using a DISTINCT clause, this book's contents will prove to be a valuable resource not only to expand your depth of knowledge of the SQL language, but also to extract the extra value that becomes visible when Oracle Database is viewed as much more than a black box dumping ground for data.

The authors of this book are all OakTable Network members and have between 15 and 29 years of experiencing working with Oracle products. This long term exposure to Oracle Database is quite clearly an advantage when discussing many of the subtopics that are simply missed by other Oracle specific SQL language references. While there was no discussion of the SQL language from Oracle Database 2.0, the authors are clearly comfortable with the features in Oracle Database 11.2 as well as the features that are available in Oracle Database 8i, 9i,10g, and 11g R1.

The book's contents are well organized. While each chapter identifies the author who wrote the chapter (possibly indicating that the authors did not work together on each individual chapter), the book flows well with plenty of forward and backward references between chapters, as well as including references to other resources (Metalink, books, and blogs). Chapter one of the book is a bit different from the rest of the chapters in the book, and appears to be written as a transition area for readers to become familiar with SQL*Plus and Oracle Database. Chapter one will be valuable to readers attempting to adjust from using graphical query tools (TOAD, SQL Developer, Excel, or any number of other graphical tools) to using SQL*Plus. Additionally, that chapter helps readers who are familiar with other SQL dialects (such as that used by SQL Server) take advantage of Oracle Database's special characteristics, and introduces readers to multi-table INSERTs and MERGE operations. Understanding the information presented in execution plans is an emphasis in the remaining chapters of the book; this book's explanation of execution plan content ranks among the best, if not the best, that I have seen to date. While there is not a single cartoon drawing in the book, and it does not appear that any sections of this book were borrowed from other books, there are several very well placed diagrams in the book's chapters. The book makes a significant effort to control the scope of the material presented. In most cases, that effort resulted in a very easy to understand, yet thorough discussions of complex topics while building bridges to help the reader transition into Oracle performance specific books, such as the book ""Troubleshooting Oracle Performance"". In a couple of areas, adding an additional half-dozen words might have saved the reader a little confusion, but those are rare occurrences in this book. Be certain to install Oracle Database's sample schema, and download the script library for this book from the Apress website (some of the scripts, especially those in chapter 16, are quite useful and may not be printed directly in the book).

Foundation knowledge, and miscellaneous comments while reading the book:
* Pages 3-8: Provides a quick demonstration of how to connect to the database using SQL*Plus, which is helpful for people who have primarily used other query tools, or other database platforms. Also demonstrates the basics of executing SQL statements, setting up the SQL*Plus environment, and executing scripts.
* The book briefly touches on why it is important to use consistent formatting and bind variables in order to reduce the number of hard parses, and why writing SQL to limit logical IO is also important.
* Page 40: Automatic query transformation often takes place, for instance, converting an IN subquery into a standard join.
* Chapter 2 tries to break open the black box approach to writing SQL statements.
* The book makes effective use of analogies.
* Page 59: The book demonstrates that the array fetch size has an impact on the number of consistent gets performed when executing a query.
* Pages 64-65: Includes a test case that shows why an index would be used in one case to retrieve 1% of the table rows, while in another case a full table scan was more appropriate to retrieve 1% of the rows.
* Page 66: Nice summary of what controls the number of blocks that are read in a single read call during a full table scan or a fast full index scan. There is one potentially confusing sentence, ""This could mean that a multiblock read might only read one block at a time."" The concepts were correctly stated, however it might be worthwhile to state that ""a multiblock read might be truncated to a single block read due to the blocks that are already in the buffer cache.""
* Pages 74-75: Describes how B*tree indexes grow from a single block in size, and what triggers the index height to increase.
* Long code sections in the early chapters with embedded comments - probably OK for the intended audience.
* Describes various type of operations found in execution plans including: TABLE ACCESS FULL, INDEX UNIQUE SCAN, INDEX RANGE SCAN, INDEX RANGE SCAN DESCENDING, INDEX FULL SCAN, INDEX FULL SCAN (MIN/MAX), INDEX FULL SCAN DESCENDING, INDEX SKIP SCAN, and INDEX FAST FULL SCAN
* Describes and lists when the various join methods (NESTED LOOPS, SORT-MERGE, HASH, CARTESIAN) are appropriate.
* Pages 120-127: Explains how NULL values behave in potentially unexpected ways in IN, NOT IN, UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, MINUS, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.
* The book demonstrates through several examples that there is more than one way to build a SQL statement to answer a specific question, but not all methods are equally efficient.

While the ""Pro Oracle SQL"" book is an overall excellent book, clearly demonstrating that there was a great deal of care put into the book, there are a couple of small problem areas in the book (note that the authors appear to have addressed most of these issues on the errata page for the book on the Apress website):
* While not significantly affecting the comprehension of the material presented in the book, there are a couple of typos in the book. For instance, on page 9 the book states ""In this book"" rather than ""In this chapter""; page 31 of the book uses the word ""effect"" rather than ""affect""; and page 221 of the book demonstrates that simple connecting words were sometimes lost, ""... would require multiple self-joins to [the] employees table."" None of these typos change the intended message of the paragraphs. However, the writing style in some of the chapters is significantly more fluid than in other chapters.
* Pages 51-52: When the optimizer did not select to automatically use the materialized view, the author used a REWRITE hint to force the optimizer to use that materialized view. It probably would have been a good idea to mention that the optimizer likely did not automatically use the materialized view because the calculated cost for that execution plan (1935) exceeded the cost for the execution plan that directly accessed the tables (485).
* Page 73: States, ""Block accesses made via an index scan are made using single-block reads."" Technically, index range scans may employ multi-block reads in certain cases (such as index pre-fetching), but stating that at this point in the book might lead to unnecessary confusion.
* Page 85: A missing word might lead to misunderstanding: ""However, in the cases where the number of subindexes needed would be smaller, the operation can be many times more efficient than a full scan as scanning [a] smaller [number of] index blocks can be more efficient than scanning [a] larger [number of] table blocks.""
* Page 94: Missing words in an explanation regarding how hash joins work might lead to misunderstanding: ""Based on table and index statistics, the table that is determined to return the fewest rows will be hashed in its entirety into memory. This hash table includes all the row data for that table..."" Based on testing, it appears that the hash table only includes the selected columns and the columns that are joined to other row sources. Additionally, the row source that is hashed into the hash table might not be from a table. Including this additional detail might be too much information for the scope of the book (reference).
* Page 102: There is a risk that the full outer join Oracle syntax equivalent implementation, when the approach is applied to other data, could yield different results from the ANSI full outer join if each row returned is not unique. One way to work around that limitation is to replace the UNION with a UNION ALL and add AND E2.ROWID IS NULL to the final WHERE clause.
* Page 163: States, ""The operation [in the execution plan] that is most indented is actually the first operation that will be executed. If there are multiple operations at the same level, the operations are executed in a top-down order."" The Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide for 11.2 from the Oracle documentation library states essentially the same fact, and is also incorrect. This guideline is correct in some cases, but incorrect in other cases as can be confirmed with a 10046 extended SQL trace. The first operation executed in an execution plan is actually the first operation from the top of the execution plan that has no child operations (reference reference2).
* Page 379: States, ""B-tree indexes are suitable for columns with lower selectivity. If the columns are not selective enough, the index range scan will be slower. Further, less selective columns will retrieve numerous rowids from the leaf blocks leading to excessive single block access to the table."" Based on the second and third quoted sentences, it appears that the author intended to state that ""B-tree indexes are GENERALLY NOT suitable for columns with lower selectivity.""
* Page 397: States, ""There is another use case for the invisible indexes. These indexes are useful to reduce the risk while dropping unused indexes... From Oracle Database version 11g onwards, you can mark the index as invisible, wait for few weeks, and then drop the index if no process is affected with less risk."" It is important that the book states ""less risk"" and not that there is no risk - it would have been helpful if the book discussed what risks remain (but again this might exceed the intended scope of the book). Just because an index is not used for a couple of weeks does not mean that the index will not be used during month-end closing, year-end processing, or some other infrequently occurring activity. Invisible indexes on foreign key columns may still be used to prevent table locking problems on the child table when the parent's primary key columns are updated. Additionally, the statistics from the invisible indexes may be used by the optimizer to more accurately determine cardinality estimates (reference reference2).
* Page 437: The third paragraph contains an apparent typo regarding the location of the online redo logs: ""Undo blocks retain the before condition of the data, while the redo information is stored in the online redo logs in the system global area (SGA).""
* Page 484: Specifies 10044 tracing when 10046 tracing was likely intended. The third paragraph states, ""I've also added code to enable 10044 tracing..."" Event 10044 appears to enable tracing of free list undo operations - I believe that the author intended to write, ""I've also added code to enable 10046 tracing...""
* Page 529: The outline_startup_trigger.sql script is not included in the script library for the book.
* Page 539: The create_tuning_task.sql and accept_sql_profile.sql scripts are not included in the script library for the book.

As indicated by the above, most of the problem areas are related to unintentional word substitutions. The majority of the other problem areas are cases where the authors had to draw the line of discussion at a selected level of detail in order to limit potential confusion and control the scope of the book. The remaining problem areas are minor in the overall context of the book, and might elicit a response from the authors along the lines of ""I thought that I modified that phrase in draft 20 of the chapter"". A fantastic Oracle SQL book that ventures well beyond simple syntax diagrams, and the book is an excellent value for the price.",8
Sergey Tatarinov,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pro Oracle SQL (Expert's Voice in Oracle),Addition to your knowledge,"This book is great. If you are DBA or developer , you will find a lot of things in this book you have ever skip for latter understanding. All core aspects of explain plans and execution plans covered perfectly. Also, ""thinking in sets"" gives you new look to the SQL core compare to the favorite ""thinking as 3GL language"". Highly recommended.",1
dag001,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pro Oracle SQL (Expert's Voice in Oracle),Expert Oracle Practices,The book seems to be very knowledgeable about expert practices - though I wanted something a little less advanced. I'd recommend it for advanced users but newbies should look elsewhere.,6
L. Morales,3.0 out of 5 stars,No Nonsense XML Web Development With PHP: Master PHP 5's Powerful New XML Functionality,This is a mixed review,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book.
The author explained a lot about xml. This is a book about XML, for sure. He talks about and gives good examples of xslt as well and covers DTD's in detail and why they are important. I learned more than I ever cared to about xslt which is certainly important, and it was user friendly and informative. Almost completely painless in fact. However, he glossed over schemas, which I found puzzling.

I didn't know that Mr. Myer uses Internet Explorer almost exclusively throughout the book, and when he finally does mention Firefox in relation to cross-browser javascript compatibility, he basically gives up trying to code it and devotes the rest of the chapter to using Sarissa, a third party open-source cross-browser javascript wrapper. I have no problem using Sarissa, but I didn't buy this book with the intention of downloading & learning yet another API. In chapter 6, ""Manipulating XML with Javascript/DHTML"", the the section titled, ""Making our test script cross-browser compatible"", he says ""...Sarissa makes it possible for you to use a single API to make your Javascript XML handling work in both types of browser. It's a huge time saver!""

A huge time saver? Really? So is paying someone else to code it for me, but that's not why I bought this book. I realize that the book is about using xml and PHP, but if you're going to mention client-side scripting, you should probably mention XMLHTTPRequest, which I couldn't find anywhere. I also wasn't really able to find any DHTML in the chapter, which is partially named DHTML. In this chapter, however, I was able to find real gems, stuff that the W3C either don't talk about much or I wasn't able to find on their site, such as ""elementNode.hasChildNodes"", which returns true if a node has children, false otherwise.

Overall, if you want to learn about XML, DTD, XPath and the various cool ways in which they interact, this book is a practical approach, so long as you remember that this is NOT an ajax book by any stretch. Discussing examples in terms of only one browser throughout the book, and introducing JS browser compatibilities midway through, and offering a third party API as a solution, was really asking alot from the reader I felt. But the book is definitely about XML and not useless. There's actually quite a bit of easy to read very technical stuff here that is presented really well and quite useful.",1
P. Payne,3.0 out of 5 stars,No Nonsense XML Web Development With PHP: Master PHP 5's Powerful New XML Functionality,Ok but not great,"This is my revised and rewritten review of this book.

The first review dated Feb 19 was just two stars, titled `Disjointed and Superficial', and read...

I bought Myer's book to help me move from XHTML to XML and to handle data with PHP which does not fit well in a relational database / SQL. I am not interested in writing a CMS, and therefore tried to skim or skip those parts. Unfortunately, some key points are buried in the CMS discussion. Subjects (ie: Namespace) seem to be mentioned or touched on in several places without doing a thorough job at any one point or multiple points. The subjects which are discussed, are not discussed in depth. And why is Ralph Waldo Emmerson given ink on page 59, and then included in the index??? I found myself working a little too hard to just get the important points.

I know Myer tried very hard to write a good book, and it is not a 'really bad' book. On a positive note: The editing error rate seems to be low as compared to a lot of first edition, first printing computer books. There is some good material in it, but this book does not work well for me. I have at least temporarily given up on this book a little short of the half way point. Since finding a really good XML book seems harder than it should be, I may come back to this one, and if so, I'll update this opinion.

Warning: [3 opinions given here appear to be by paid reviewers. ie: 9/14/05, 10/7/05, and 11/8/05. I now suspect some of the others are personal friends of the author. Hint: Check out the person writing the review before actually reading it. Look for how many opinions he/she writes and how many stars. I distrust all high opinions in the first few months of publication, all high opinions by people who have only written a couple of opinions, and all high opinions from people who only write high opinions. Bottom Line: Distrust all high opinions except those from people who have established some evidence of independence by posting negative as well as positive opinions about other books. Thanks for the lack of honesty Tommy &/or Sitepoint &/or big A. I would have given 3 stars if there were not so many false ones posted here. (my opinion, 2 cma).]

Now, having finished Myer's book (except for most of the CMS stuff), I have changed it to 3 stars and concluded ....

There are about an equal number of pros and cons. It is somewhat light and easy to read, and the editing error rate is good. It is kind of a quick survey of subjects which Myer thinks are important. I did like chapters 7 & 9 (Manipulating XML with PHP, & XML and Web Services).

On the con side: The Appendix listing of PHP functions / methods is not complete and no examples are given. Where he discusses ways to extract XML from a database, two different sources (tables) are used, so the results are not comparable. I wish he had spent more ink on handling XML with PHP and less on client side technologies which are not well supported yet. I found the example listings a little short and lacking some additional code which would have helped follow what was supposed to happen. More output/results listings would also have helped.

The book is not particularly complete, and could not be used as a reference, but it may be ok (not great) as an overview or introduction. A better intro book may be `Beginning XML, 3rd Edition' by David Hunter etc., although that is a much bigger book.

Lastly, do not trust any high star rating review unless the source has proven his/her impartiality by posting positive as well as not so positive reviews of other books. Too many opinions of this book do not pass that simple test. The basic problem is determining who to believe and which postings to suspect are covertly trying to sell books because they have a vested interest or undisclosed motive.",19
M. Boughter,4.0 out of 5 stars,No Nonsense XML Web Development With PHP: Master PHP 5's Powerful New XML Functionality,Is XML as useful as claimed?,"This book is helpful and easy to understand and follow, however, the more I read about XML the less useful it seems to be. If I knew then what I know now I probably wouldn't bother learning about XML because I work with web design and nothing else. I am familiar with PHP and MYSQL so I can't really find a purpose for XML at this time. The book is great but the technology is not as useful as I thought it would be.

I may change my mind in the future but for now XML is on the back burner and PHP/MYSQL is my current focus.

My point in this review is to let others know that if you already know PHP and MYSQL and only work on the web then you may find learning XML redundant or maybe even useless. I'm sure it would look great on a resume though.",2
E. Borota,5.0 out of 5 stars,Applied Number Theory,Beautiful in every way.,"Beautifully written, well motivated, rigorous and discusses number theory. The quality of the paper, printing and composition of the book is great as well. H. Niederreiter is a world-class researcher in random number generators / numerical distributions, and finite fields, and all of those areas are discussed. Each chapter begins with an amusing limerick. Overall, a perfect book. Rigorous, beautiful subject matter explained by a top authority, motivation and humor. One cannot ask for more.

Few books possess the quality this one does. It is an example of lovely exposition. Relative to that, I put it in the same category as ""Foundations of Constructive Analysis"" by Errett Bishop, ""The Art of Computer Programming"" by Don Knuth, ""Enumerative Combinatorics"" by Richard P. Stanley, ""Mathematical Logic"" by S.C. Kleene, ""Principles of Mathematical Analysis"" by Walter Rudin, and ""Analysis I and II"" / ""Analytic Function Theory, vol. I and II"" by Einar Hille. Possibly a few other books, notably ones by John E. Hopcroft, Al Aho, Robert W Floyd, and Jeffrey D. Ullman.

I hope this book becomes more well known, because it is an absolute gem!",1

PairOfDocs,1.0 out of 5 stars,Handbook of Blind Source Separation: Independent Component Analysis and Applications,Good Book but cannot read the equations on the Kindle Edition,"This appears to be a large and thorough review of Blind Source Separation techniques. The text to the book is fine. However, in the Kindle edition the equations appear in reversed colors (gray on black) and are nearly unreadable. I tried to view the book on both my Kindle DX and by using the Kindle-PC application on my desktop - same problem on both. I'm extremely disappointed with the Kindle edition of this book and wish I had gotten the print copy instead. I'm working on a graduate degree and this book could have been a big help. But without readable equations it is nearly useless.

I have other Kindle textbooks that are easy to read. Unfortunately, the equations in the book are nearly unreadable - they must be in some strange format that is hard to display.

Normally, I am a huge fan of the Kindle and hope to eventually get all of my books in electronic form for both the convenient portable size, searchability, and a reduction to the amount of physical space required to store large books.

Unfortunately, due to the unreadable equations, I cannot recommend the Kindle format for this particular book. The big, heavy, 800+ page book may be a better choice for this title.",3

Glenn,4.0 out of 5 stars,Collective Intelligence in Action,Survey Level Introduction for Engineers,"Collective Intelligence is a big topic so the title of this book is very ambitious. The author is too. He sets out to explain all things collective intelligence circa 2009.

Like any good text book, the material is presented in an iterative and incremental way. High level concepts are introduced first. Popular features such as tag clouds and recommendation engines are defined. How collective intelligence manifests in the GUI and screen flow of various popular web properties is illustrated. Various data structures and algorithms are classified. Simple examples of some of the underlying math is worked out. Open source libraries are recommended and coding examples presented. Topics are introduced simply at first and revisited in later chapters with ever increasing amounts of detail.

However, there's a lot of math in the topic of collective intelligence and this is not a math book. Neither does it take a ""heads up"" or ""for dummies"" approach. Instead, it aims somewhere in the middle which gives the book a bit of an identity crisis.

If you're a script jock or a web master whose level of technical competence doesn't extend too far past embedding a youtube video or paypal ""buy now"" button on your pages, then the most that you are going to get out of this book is just the high level introductory material.

The formally trained software engineer can treat this book as a great introductory survey level course on the subject that does attempt to peal back some of the layers of complexity. It is neither definitive nor canonical so you will be doing more research and studying before you deploy any sophisticated collective intelligence in your applications.",4

Charles Hooper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pro Exchange Server 2013 Administration (Expert's Voice in Exchange),Sufficient Detail to Perform Exchange Conversions and Administer Exchange 2013,"I started looking at replacing Exchange Server 2007 a bit over a year ago, and was quite surprised to see books on the market describing Exchange Server 2013 all the way back in December 2012. Exchange Server 2013 was released for general availability on December 3, 2012, so some of those books that I looked at the end of 2012 likely jumped the gun a bit, with reviews that more or less state as much.

This book was released in December 2013, just in time for Exchange Server 2013 SP 1, released February 24, 2014, to possibly cause a few of the book's statement of facts to no longer hold true. The text of the book appears to cover through Exchange Server cumulative roll up 2. A web search for information about Exchange Server 2013 SP 1 revealed that the author is maintaining a set of articles that address Exchange Server 2013 roll up 3 and service pack 1, so the book's contents are effectively being updated by the author. The Apress website has a fairly extensive downloadable script collection for this book.

In addition to buying this book, I also purchased the ""Mastering Microsoft Exchange Server 2013"" book. As a matter of comparison, this book seems to be a little better organized, with fewer hidden nuggets of information that will be missed by skim-reading the book. This book has a significantly higher number of grammar, spelling, and word substitution problems than the Mastering book, that if it were not for the content in the last 75 pages of the book, I would have deducted one or two stars from this book's rating. The grammar problems seem to be mostly concentrated in the first half of the book, while the spelling errors, mostly simple typos that should have been caught by a spelling checker or book editor, continued throughout the book. This book has a much more thorough troubleshooting section than the Mastering book, including a potential solution for iOS devices that cause a heavy load on the Exchange Server's CPUs. In addition to covering the built-in troubleshooting functionality such as reviewing the event logs, queue viewer, and the Microsoft autodiscover tool, this book also described:
* Using the IIS logs to troubleshoot Autodiscover (page 116)
* VSSADMIN tool to list the VSS writers on the server (page 258)
* Troubleshooting with the TELNET client (page 354)

I recorded five pages of typewritten notes from this book, compared to just three and a half pages from the Mastering book, which is a bit surprising considering that the Mastering book is about twice as long. Some of the interesting items from my notes:
* It is necessary to ""touch"" the address list from the Exchange 2013 server Pg 101: Get-AddressList | Set-AddressList

* It is possible to use the IIS logs to help troubleshoot Auodiscover. Pg 116

* Exchange uses an ESE (JET) database, like Active Directory, WINS and DHCP. Pg 131. The ESE database is JET Blue, while an Access database is JET Red.

* In Exchange 2013, Exchange no longer supports Single Instance Storage, where a large email attachment sent to several people would only be stored once in the database (as was the case in prior Exchange versions) - such an attachment is now stored once for each recipient. Pg 137

* Example of creating mailbox enabled users using a CSV file. Pg 195

* Pipe Exchange Management Shell output to ConvertTo-HTML to generate command output in HTML format, then use > to redirect that output to a file. Pg 201

* Exchange 2013 has a ""self-healing"" feature called Managed Availability, where Exchange is constantly monitoring its health and attempts to take appropriate action when the health monitoring indicates a problem. Pg 305 (Side note: this monitoring leaves behind a mess in the Journal mailboxes.)

* Example of creating a Powershell HTML formatted email that indicates what is in the SMTP queue. Pg 333

* Change the ActiveSync policy to Discretionary if iPhone and iPad users generate too much load on the Exchange Server, see page 341 for the script. While not mentioned in the book, this is a significant potential problem, as reported in various Internet forum posts. See Microsoft knowledgebase article 2563324 for a potential solution that does not affect the ActiveSync policy setting.

Errors and Concerns So Far (I might update this list later):
* The first quarter of the book seemed to use an unnecessary number of half page or three quarter page screen captures.

* An abnormal number of typos are in the book that probably should have been identified by a spelling and grammar checker, the author, or a book editor. The grammar problems are concentrated mostly in the first half of the book. Some examples:
--- Page 62 and page 65 instruct the reader to execute the same command.
--- On page 82 (and at least one other page) the author used the phrase ""green-field installation"" without defining that phrase.
--- On page 146 (and at least one other page) the author used the word ""beamer"" when describing resource mailboxes. Using the word ""projector"" might have reduced a bit of potential confusion.
--- On page 218 the book states that the default database quota setting to prohibit send and receive is 2.1GB. The actual default is 2.3GB.
--- On page 290, the book has a typo, ""Outlook 2007 Professioanl [sic] Plus""
--- On page 296, the book has an accidental word substitution, ""... and these passive clients are not used by any clients; they are used for redundancy purposes.""
--- On page 299, the book has a typo, ""Use the Browse butten [sic] to select...""
--- On page 314, the book has a word substitution that could cause a configuration problem, ""A more realistic approach is to use a 24GB requirement [of RAM memory] per active mailbox when a usage profile of 100 messages per day is anticipated.""
--- On page 314, GB is used to describe a processor characteristic, ""If a 4GB processor core server is used, you end up with a 10GB memory requirement for an Exchange CAS-only server.""
--- On page 322, the book has a typo, ""You will most likely see unexptected [sic] results...""

I am a hands-on IT manager, so I performed some brief testing of Exchange Server 2013 SP 1. Below are some of my notes from that testing:
* While a lot of books (including this one) likely state that there should be no firewall between the Exchange Server and the domain controllers, installing Exchange Server 2013 on a new Windows Server 2012 machine will fail if the local firewall on the Exchange Server server is disabled, likely failing with an error stating that the Remote Registry service may not be running. Not only will the install fail, but the installer may start the Windows firewall, thus blocking all connections to the server; in the first trial the Intel teaming 802.3ad network configuration was also corrupted, meaning that connections to the server still failed even after the Windows firewall was disabled. (Side note: on Windows Server 2012 it is also not possible to share out a printer unless the local firewall on the server is enabled.)

* This book (on page 50) is correct that a SMTP send connector had to be created for a mailbox on Exchange 2013 to send an email to a mailbox on a different Exchange Server in the same site, at least when that mailbox is located on Exchange Server 2007. The messages remained in a SMTP queue until the SMTP send connector was created. It appears that page 615 of the ""Mastering Microsoft Exchange Server 2013"" book may be incorrect, the following is a paraphrase of that other book: ""Exchange 2013 has built-in send connectors for Exchange Servers in the same site - these built-in connectors will not show in the user interface.""

* There is a bug in Exchange Server 2013 SP 1 that affects third-party transport agents, which likely impacts any virus scanners that are used on the server. See Microsoft knowledgebase article 2938053 for a patch.

* A third party virus scanner may also require CGI scripting support in IIS, and .Net 3.5 SP 1, so it might be beneficial to install those features while installing the other requirements for Exchange Server. The Windows Server 2012 installation media includes .Net 3.5 SP 1.

* The user interface seems to indicate that the built-in anti-malware is still active even though that feature was turned off during installation. A user-interface unchangeable checkbox contains a checkmark indicating that anti-malware is enabled. To disable the built-in anti-malware, if a third party virus scanner is used, execute the Disable-AntimalwareScanning.ps1 script, then restart the MSExchangeTransport service.

* The book states (on page 116 and probably a couple of other pages) that when the Exchange 2013 Client Access Server is installed, none of the virtual directories (Autodiscover, OWA, ECP, etc.) are configured with an Internal URL or an External URL. With a fresh install of Exchange Server 2013 SP 1 I found that all of the internal virtual directories appeared to be configured, but none of the external virtual directories were configured. If the Internal URLs were also pre-set during a non-SP1 install of Exchange Server 2013, then the book is incorrect on this item.

* On or around page 98, the book states that a message will appear in Outlook when that user's mailbox move completes, if the user is running Outlook during the move operation. The book also stated that Outlook 2013 does not need to restart when the mailbox move completes (Edit: correction, the book stated that if the mailbox was already on an _Exchange Server 2013_ server and the mailbox is moved to another 2013 server, the user does not need to restart Outlook). Based on my testing with Exchange Server 2013 SP1, after a mailbox is moved from Exchange 2007 to Exchange 2013, an Outlook 2007 or 2010 client will be prompted to restart Outlook when Outlook is started for the first time after the mailbox move completes (so the message still appears even if Outlook was not running during the move). Outlook 2013, which was running on a client computer at the time of the mailbox move, displayed a message stating that Outlook had to be restarted due to a change made by the Exchange administrator. After restarting Outlook 2013, the following message appeared: ""Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window. The set of folders cannot be opened. Microsoft Exchange is not available. Either there are network problems or the Exchange server is down for maintenance."" (and re-appeared every time Outlook was restarted). Examining the Outlook profile indicated that the old Exchange 2007 server was still specified, rather than being updated as expected. Deleting and recreating the Outlook profile on that computer fixed the problem.

* Moving email accounts from Exchange Server 2007 to Exchange Server 2013 may cause a new replacement SMTP email address to be created that conforms with the standard Email Address Policy. For example, if the person's name is Robert Jones and the Email Address Policy is configured to use the first letter of the first name and the full last name, the person's SMTP address on the old Exchange Server 2007 would begin with RJones followed by the domain name. If at some point in the past the person's display name was changed from Robert Jones to Bob Jones, the person's SMTP address would be changed to begin with BJones when the account is moved to Exchange Server 2013 (the former SMTP address will also be listed for the user, with smtp in lowercase letters, but would not used for incoming and outgoing emails). The problem is worse for special email accounts were an entry was only specified in the first name field on the old server - in those cases the new generated SMTP address for the email account would become a single letter after the move to Exchange Server 2013.

* The GUI user interface for Exchange Server 2013 SP 1 now allows changing the internal and external URLs for the various virtual directories by clicking Servers at the left, and Virtual Directories at the right. Both books stated that the internal URLs could not be changed through the GUI interface, so this difference might be a change for SP 1.

* Good luck trying to use self-signed certificates with Exchange Server 2013 - doing so just might be possible.

---

Overall, this is a helpful book, but the book does not have all of the answers. I generally prefer to always have a second opinion (or corroborating evidence) on facts found in this and other books, so picking up a second companion Exchange Server 2013 book might be very beneficial.",14
SuzBej,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pro Exchange Server 2013 Administration (Expert's Voice in Exchange),This is the best technical manual I have every purchased,This is the best technical manual I have ever purchased.

Dixie River,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pro SQL Server 2008 Reporting Services (Books for Professionals by Professionals),Don't waste your money,"I have the 2005 version of this book I purchased several years ago but ended up not being able to look at it. I opened it up a couple of weeks ago and realized I might as well start on 2008 since that's the platform I predominantly use and the 2005 didn't synch up well with the 2008 interface.

So I ordered this book. First it's the same book with an attempt to go in and edit where necessary where there were changes in 2008. So with that I'm kind of miffed I paid $39.99 for the same book I already have with minor changes.

To make matters worse, this must have been edited during the beta because I'm through chapter 3 right now and the start versions of the reports I've yet to find one that works by just following what's in the book.

Things such as right click to open up properties of a row group is incorrect, you must also select group properties. They tell you to go to the layout tab but it's called the Design tab in 08. These couple of things are minor but it tells me this book was hastily done without much attention to detail and in my opinion doesn't warrant it's cost. Also, how about an upgrade price for persons who purchased the first one?

The group on's don't work like mentioned in the book in most cases following the procedures in the order presented in the book.

Bottom line, for me to make a purchase such as this, I do it so I don't have to hassle with tinkering. To me this is a book in the category of do what I mean versus what I say. Again, for my purpose of spending $40 on a book, it totally defeats the purpose of the purchase if I have to fill in blanks to get things to work.

If I want to waste the time doing that I'll go on line and just use the documenation.

The download also contains a start version and an working version. It's starting to become clear that the RDL definitions from previous versions will work but trying to follow the instructions of making the start.rdl's work clearly don't work.

Take image.rdl versus's Image Start.rdl. Image.RDL is in a Tablix but Image Start.RDL is not so the fields in it aren't bound.

I had to play around for 30 minutes of manipulating to figure out a way to get it to work. Again, complete waste of money if you look for books that you appear to be as close to error free so you can learn and then use as a reference.

Wait for a book that written from scratch on the RTM of BI 2008 tools.

G. A. Schoenagel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Invariant Variational Principles,Invaluable Complement to Mathematics and Physics Textbooks,"Dwight Neuenschwander, in his timely book, Emmy Noether's Wonderful Theorem (2011) acknowledges
Professor John David Logan. After perusal of this exceptional monograph, it is easy to understand why.
This slim book (169 pages total) of Eight Chapters has a flavor all its own. I am unable to locate reviews
in the usual journals, though I'm sure they must exist. (Perhaps,my search was not thorough enough).
Thus, I delight in offering a perspective on this lovely tome. Thorough preparation of Advanced Calculus
(say, Taylor) will be ample prerequisite. Chapter One: foundation of Calculus of Variations and Euler-
Lagrange Equations. Examples, remarks, and simpler proofs sprinkle the discourse. The fourteen problems
ending this chapter are all straightforward exercises. After which, we enter the promised land of invariance:
""Invariance properties of single integrals under transformations which depend on r-parameters."" (Page 27).
This second chapter introduces Noether and requisite Theorem. Galilean Invariance and particle mechanics
provide (via a lovely ten pages) segue to the third chapter. (And, end of chapter-two problems straightforward).
A brief third --yet, lucid--chapter introduces Killing's Equations, applied to solution of the damped harmonic oscillator.
Next up, abstract and challenging : Invariance of Multiple Integrals. Six problems at end, happily,too, hints provided.
Comparison to Gelfand and Fomin's Calculus of Variations (Chapter Seven,1963) is fruitful at this juncture,also.
Tensors set the stage, next, for the discussion of Theory of Physical Fields. Here, we have a highlight of this text.
""...Invariance considerations in field theory arise naturally from the postulates of special relativity."" (Page 76).
The previous four chapters are provided physical motivation: Lorentz Group, Electromagnetic Field (here, Heaviside-
Lorentz Units utilized). Any ( or should I say, every) physicist should be familiar with Logan's crisp exposition.
In fact, comparison with Akheizer 's The Calculus of Variations (1962, Chapter Two) at this point proves illuminating.
Once again, the thirteen exercises which conclude the chapter are--for the most part--straightforward to solve.
The Final three chapters are considerable more challenging, though no less interesting.
We are introduced to the Vibrating rod as a physical example, plus the KdV Equation, exposing higher-order derivatives.
We are introduced to Conformal Invariance. One of the problems asks us to inspect the Klein-Gordon Equation under
special Conformal transformations, ""...thus, Lorentz Transformations are Conformal transformations with conformal
factor unity..."" (Page 139). Finally, an introduction to parameter-invaraince: ""....their role in geometry and relativistic
mechanics is a significant one...""( Page 151). A statement which is substantiated throughout the remainder of text.
And, so, ends a rather unique foray under the rubric of Invariance and Variational Principles.
With its well-written prose, its clarity of exposition and minimum of prerequisites demanded,
I can think of few monographs which are as delightful to peruse ( Complementing the texts of Akheizer and Gelfand).
A short list of references provides signpost to more detailed ( and historical) material.
An excellent expository monograph.
Highly Recommended to those with interests along these routes.",1
Michael_P_,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Biometrics in the New World: The Cloud, Mobile Technology and Pervasive Identity",Much below expectations,"I was very much looking forward for this book.

The introduction claims that the book is not your regular treatease about biometrics. But unfortunately, it is. Lots of defocused basic information totally lacking thought leadership and direction, all written by a non-technical author. Maybe it's good for a legal council just starting a job in the biometric industry, but way too simplistic for business or technical people. Very few real-life examples, and no technical depth. Many ideas on the privacy represent the thinking prevalent several years ago, while they recently morphed into something different.

If you want to get an explanation about b-trees, index keys and database indices this book is for you.

Christian R. Unger,2.0 out of 5 stars,Burdens of Proof: Cryptographic Culture and Evidence Law in the Age of Electronic Documents (MIT Press),"a well researched, but cluttered, boring mess that doesn't offer solution, merely a state of affairs","This book is terribly written. It offers a good background of the evolution of the field of ascertaining the authenticity of digital documents. That said, it outlines only problems without offering solutions. This would not be so bad if it was well written, but instead it is verbose, mostly constructed of quotes with some syntactic errors (although considering the heavy reliance on quotes, Blanchette does do quite well on that front).

Overall this will offer few insights to people familiar with some aspect of cryptography, though the different key types defined was something of interest to me and I had not come across it before. Realistically though, none of these new glimpses go very deep. Still, this is written by an academic, and the citations are literally (though not counting the index) a quarter of the book (60 odd pages of references to 192 of actual text).

The biggest failure here is that the book never offers a solution, rather it gives the state of affairs, and includes three interesting (although frustrating) case studies. What would have helped here, would have been to discuss maybe some options on how these could have been implemented better, or at least discussing all that is wrong with the result other than leaving it up to the reader to draw their own conclusions. For instance: One case study mentioned using scanned physical signatures as part of a digital ""seal"" to be affixed to documents to indicate who processed/verified them, which was then treated as a ""digital signature"". To me this is clearly a bad thing. It's like making day old bread ""fresh"" by putting it in a toaster. You may not notice the bread was stale, but it still is not fresh. Clearly though the people that implemented this thought this was a good idea, so discussing this in greater depth form both their perspective, and taking this apart would be good ammunition for the target audience of readers who may come across this themselves.

In a similar vein, the book discusses information leakage by monitoring the CPU of a host doing cryptographic work and using that to crack the encryption. Although this was interesting, it isn't what most people would have to worry about, rather it'd be about keeping their private key safe. Social engineering doesn't get mentioned and there is a distinct focus on the outlandish (albeit possible) in favor of where security generally really does fall apart. There is one good discussion of bit rot (document formats aging out) meaning that document's formats need to be updated and then re-signed, which inherently means the signature is worthless and the chain of evidence is no longer in the hands of infallible math but people who might change things (precisely what's supposed to be protected against), but that is the rarity where a real issue is discussed. And irrespectively, no solution is really offered.

And finally, the book is dreadfully boring. There are maybe twenty pages that are not an utter chore to read, but on the whole it's like reading a law text book or a collection of judgements in a case. The language is inaccessible, and the structure is Kafka-esque with sentences that drone on without (unlike Kafka) ever reaching a point. Largely this is a failing arising out of the heavy use of quotes, and although it is good to know that smart people said this, the piecemeal chunking together of their message is frustrating to read, mind numbing and in the end boring. Paraphrasing would definitely have helped here.

Who is this book for: people explicitly working on document management and digital signing. Should you read it? Yes as an introduction, and if you need this introduction for a research paper or work then this is going to be a decent source of information and further readings. But who do I think this book was really (originally) targeted at? I think this is the literature review for post graduate research, jazzed up a little to be more readable (albeit not much). That would explain why it doesn't present a conclusion of how things could be done better: because that's the meat of a research paper to be peer reviewed, and would also explain why it is so heavily quoted.

So final take: rich in information that is poorly presented. Great starting point for someone who needs to read it, and needs to delve straight into document related use of digital signing. But as it is utterly lacking any depth in the broader field of how certificates are used it makes it boring for people that don't need to know (such as myself, I merely wanted to know).",3
John Smith,3.0 out of 5 stars,Programming in Prolog,Dissatisfied,"Pros:
- Even someone with no programming or math knowledge could pick up the book, read it, and learn Prolog
- Uses ISO-Prolog
- Large section of helpful example programs

Big Cons:
(I'll give citations, only from the first 100 pages to keep things short, lest anyone think I am lying about the problems with the book)
- Frequent syntax errors *in program statements* - in Prolog, every comma and period is absolutely essential, when they are missing it entirely changes the meaning of the statement - the book misses them pretty routinely (p 81, twice)
- Frequent logic errors - in Prolog, the order of facts and rules is extremely important. The book commonly mixes things up, presenting you with programs that will not work (p 56 - note here that they are trying to give an example of what will/won't work, and they get it backwards)
- Frequent editing/formatting errors - charts, diagrams etc are fairly often on the wrong page or in the wrong location, etc. (p 48)
- Poor organization - looking through the table of contents, you would think the book is extremely well organized, but as you read it, you'll find new and important ideas thrown into random sections - if you forget something, and need to find it later, you'll probably need to re-skim the entire book. Things are almost never presented in convenient bullets/numbering, almost always in paragraph form, again, making essential ideas tedious to find.
- Confusing - I have degrees in math and computer science, and have been programming for 15 years, and I still found parts of the book hard to follow - note that it had nothing to do with Prolog itself, which is actually very straightforward, but rather with the explanations given, which sometimes seem meandering and poorly worded.
- A really short and crummy index makes things hard to find. For example, look up ""atoms"", a concept first mentioned on page 26, and routinely mentioned afterwards, a concept absolutely essential to understanding Prolog - the index shows that the first (and only) time it appears is on page 123.

Average Cons:
- Authors use an ""arrow system"" to trace Prolog decision making, I think a table system (which could easily show previous, current, and future steps, and details of each iteration) would have been better while presenting more information in a clearer fashion.
- Code re-use - normally a good thing, frustrating in this book. You might have a rule (like a function) called ""mother(X)..."" early on in the book, not use it for 100 pages, and then it appears again. If you want to try the program out yourself, you'll need to know the exact definition of ""mother(X)..."". There's no way to find what page the function was on in the index or TOC, so you find yourself spending 30 minutes leafing through the book to find it. 99% of these are a single line of code, so there's really no need to reuse them, it's hardly saving any space.
- Overly complex examples - sometimes the authors illustrate an idea with 20 lines of code, when 4 would have been sufficient. It makes for a lot of extra reading and deciphering.

Small Cons:
- (This could be a pro or con - since I don't know too many people who *start* their programming experience with Prolog, I assume the reader has some experience with programming, and so list this as a con) Book is far too detailed for someone with moderate programming or math experience. This helps some people, but makes it a tedious read for others. Every concept is thoroughly explained. If you're a programmer, this gets a little old during things like variables and recursion. If you know any math, verbose explanations of predicate logic will become tiresome. In fairness, it was no doubt the authors' intention to make a ""complete"" introduction to Prolog, and so it is hard to criticize this.
- (Another pro/con, depending on the reader) British examples - the authors are British (or at least one of them is), and use British references in their code all the time (9th century princes of Wales, p 34; horses who won races in Britain in 1927, p 53) - if you're British this might break up the monotony and make things a little more interesting, if you're not, it just gets a little old, I'd rather see every example just use ""cat"",""dog"",""mouse"".

Other:
- NOT a good reference book (and it wasn't meant to be), if you know Prolog already and need a reference book, look elsewhere. This is for people who do not know Prolog.

Conclusion:
- I wish I bought a different book. BUT despite everything, I did adequately learn Prolog from this book, so will reluctantly give it 3 stars.",45
M. Marquardt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming in Prolog,Highly Recommended,"Programming in Prolog is a clear, precise introduction to Prolog from the ground up.

While is does start with the basics, it is an incredibly thorough text, covering all minutia of the language. The text is clear, easy to understand, and to the point, moving quickly through topics without sacrificing understanding.

I used this book as a supplementary text in an upper-division college course. After reading only the first four chapters, I knew things about the language that the instructor did not.
I highly recommend this book to any programmer of any skill level that is interested in learning the Prolog programming language.

Additionally,
The following two books were recommended in the preface of Programming in Prolog. The first as a quicker (though not as complete) overview for the experienced programmer, and the second as a language reference.

Prolog: The Standard: Reference Manual",2
White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming in Prolog,Excellent core text on Prolog,"This is the ""KnR"" of Prolog programming. It has the same diversity of style that some people who might want a ""how to program Prolog in 24 hours"" approach won't appreciate. It covers the basis of the language however in a way that ties together, as all good programming reference books do, the fundamental reasoning that went into the language and how to use it effectively in the way it was meant to be. Great to read on Kindle app.",1

Perhaps back in 2005 when this book became public, the exam was similar to the book. Now it is not. The book only covers a 1/2 of the material.

Ned R.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"IT Project Management: On Track from Start to Finish, Second Edition (Certification Press)",incoherent thoughts,"Okay, I read this book end-to-end. Disappointing though. The contents are not close to what you find in the Project+ exam. The heading, subheading and paragraphs are not coherent and they do not tie together. It is hard to find out, in few paragraphs, what author is trying to tell. Chapter summaries are disorganized and sometime do not cover what is in the chapter. Some of the figures do not make sense (see figure 6-5 on page 189...do you really need to create a figure to tell Arguments take a project off schedule and increase costs).",3
Dr. Lee D. Carlson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Logic For Learning,Good introduction...ALKEMY needs more investigation,"This book gives an introduction to computational logic and machine learning in the context of higher-order logic, and also serves as a rudimentary introduction to functional logic programming languages. My interest in it was stirred by its emphasis on comprehensibility in learning, its attempt to discuss inductive logic programming and the construction of inductive decision trees in a higher-order logic context, and to see whether or not I could use the ALKEMY language for practical applications.
In chapter 1, the author takes the position that higher-order logic meets the needs of knowledge representation in that it can represent complex individuals, is able to formulate the hypothesis language precisely, and allows the computation of values of a function in the background theory on an individual. He also justifies the use of types in the book, claiming that such a use will result in a ""substantial payoff"". The author identifies seven different learning issues that he will study in the book. One of these concerns the representation of individuals. Another concerns the specification of a signature for the target function whose definition is to be induced. The third learning issue deals with the training data, each piece of data giving the value of the target function for a particular individual. The fourth issue deals with the need for a background theory, which is a collection of definitions of the functions that act on the individuals. The fifth issue concerns the hypothesis language, which specifies the functions in the background theory. The need for evaluating the predictive power of the constructed hypothesis is the sixth learning issue.The last issue concerns the requirement of comprehensibility of the hypotheses returned by the learning system. The hypotheses must provide an insight and explanation of the data, rather than merely a ""black-box"" with possibly high predictive power.
Chapter 2 gives an overview of the syntax and semantics of higher-order logic. The author clarifies in detail what is meant by ""defined inductively"", and proves a principle of induction on the structure of types. The importance of the collection of parameter-free ""closed"" types is brought out, and the author gives examples of various types that have been used in logic programming. Type substitutions, terms, subterms, and term substitutions are all defined in great detail, and many examples of each are given. Term substitution can be tricky and does not merely involve the replacing of a free occurrence of a variable by a term. He also shows, in the context of term substitution, that one does not need to do run-time type checking in logic programming. The model and proof theory of this theory of types is developed at the end of the chapter.
In chapter 3, the author how to represent knowledge in logic theories. For machine learning applications, a particular set of terms, called ""basic terms"" are used to represent individuals. Basic terms are defined in terms of default and normal terms with a suitable equivalance relation put on the normal terms. In higher order logic, sets are represented essentially as characteristic functions, i.e. as predicates. The concept of a default term arises in this method of representation, and is defined inductively in terms of default data constructors. Default terms are then used to define (inductively) ""normal terms"". A notion of equivalence of normal terms is defined, and a strict total order is put on the normal terms in order to allow one to select a single representative from an equivalence class. The ""basic"" terms are then defined. The author shows that the normal equivalence relation is the identity on basic terms, and this allows him to define a ""basic form"". He then shows how to obtain the basic form of a normal term. Several different metrics and kernels are defined on the basic terms.
The author addresses the construction of predicates in chapter 4, this being done incrementally via the composition of transformations. The author then defines a larger class of predicates, called the ""standard predicates"", along with a subclass, the ""regular predicates"". The ""background theory"" is the theory consisting of the definitions of the transformations. After placing a relation of strict total order on the standard predicates, the regular predicates are defined by induction on the number of transformations in a predicate and in terms of this ordering. Every standard predicate is shown to be equivalent to a regular predicate and an algorithm is given for constructing this regular predicate, the resulting regular predicate being called a ""regularization"" of the standard predicate. Then predicate rewrite systems (PRS), are studied, and related to machine learning as a generation of a search space of standard predicates.To determine when one predicate logically implies the other, the author defines an implication ""preorder"" on the space of predicates, which then allows the characterization of a PRS as ""monotone"", and a notion of ""regularization"" of a PRS.
The goal of the next chapter is to develop a computational formalism by viewing programs as collections of definitions or ""equational theories"". A computational model for programs is developed which is decidable, and which contains the familiar notions of equality, connectives and quantifiers, etc. The author introduces his notion of ""programming with abstractions"", which he claims allows the functional programming paradigm to be done in a logic programming style.
The last chapter is an overview of the (publically available) ALKEMY system for (binary) decision-tree learning, The author gives a detailed description of the decision-tree algorithm used by ALKEMY, which has as input a set of examples, a predicate rewrite system, and a parameter. Examples are composed of a basic term and its class, and the algorithm constructs a decision tree by labeling each leaf node of the tree but its majority class, and then performing error-complexity post-pruning on the tree. The author gives several examples of the use of ALKEMY, such as the East-West challenge game, Bongard pattern recognition, the Musk problem, mutagenesis, and a molecule recognition problem from chemistry.",11
J. Kidding,5.0 out of 5 stars,Probability and Information Theory With Applications To Radar (Radar Library),A readable classic from the early days,"Sometimes a paper or a book that creates a big stir remains the best, most readable, most illuminating introduction to the topic for many decades, even while a hundred other writers attempt to cover the same ground. Shannon's ""A Mathematical Theory of Communication"" is certainly one such. If you haven't read it at least twice, do it now. A third reading wouldn't hurt. Woodward's ""Probability and Information Theory with Applications to Radar"" is another, at least for me. It was published in 1953, five years after Shannon. It represents an intelligent and articulate man's attempt to understand the new topic of information theory in the context of radar signal analysis, the area in which he had worked during the war. Alan Turing didn't save western civilization all by himself, whatever Hollywood thinks. Woodward takes the topic in a completely different direction than the standard modern treatment of information theory. This could only have happened while the subject was brand new.

The first four chapters are a review of fundamentals; probability theory, signal analysis, information theory, and detection theory. You may be tempted to skim these, but resist. Woodward's comments and examples, like the sections on ""information-destroying processes"" and ""guesswork"", are worth it. And the whole book is only 125 pages! There follows a transitional chapter on radar fundamentals. The last two chapters, ""the mathematical analysis of radar information"" and ""the transmitted radar signal"" are the reason for reading this book and should be read closely. You'll be rewarded with gems like his trash-talking of the uncertainty principle,

""Whenever time and frequency are mentioned in one breath, we expect to find reciprocal relations and 'uncertainty principles,' and certainly we might anticipate some such relation in radar if we attempt to measure range and velocity simultaneously... But this is quite fallacious.""

He's right, because a radar waveform is not a fundamental particle. I won't spoil it for you, you'll just have to read chapter 7 for yourself.",1

Emmanuel B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Java Persistence with Hibernate,Still the best reference on hibernate !,"The must-read english reference on Hibernate.
Although it's mainly about Hibernate 3.2 (and the actual version of hibernate beeing 4.1), the book is still the most complete reference on hibernate so far.

It will help you understand the foundamental knowledge you need to harness the technology.

The examples are clear and working; there are a very little amount of typos but they are easy to figure out. Moreover you will find an errata on hibernate web site.

Who is this book for ?
This book is for newbies as well as for experience developers who will find it to be a good reference manuel on Hibernate.

It is not an How-To book.

You will need to forget about your current project requirement for a litlle while ( one week for me) and enter deeply in the book, trying the examples.

After a week on this book, and a second week trying to apply it to my project, I really experienced an ""I Know Kunfu"" moment !

I really recommend this book !",3
Yelekeri,2.0 out of 5 stars,Java Persistence with Hibernate,can someone write the book so bad,"After reading the first 2 chapters you would feel that you are going to learn lots of things from this book. And the excitement ends right there. From the 3rd chapter on, you probably would never complete the whole chapter. You keep skipping everything but still don't know why you skipped.

I felt like somebody lost is a desert desperately looking for something. All thru reading the book, I was looking for more information on the web, although an 850 pages of content is right in my hands.

Of all the technical books I read, this probably is the one I couldn't complete and no desire to read. May be I would use it as a reference once I understand completely about Hibernate. But wait, how to look for the information in this book, you have read it all over again from the beginning.",2
juanitodread,5.0 out of 5 stars,Java Persistence with Hibernate,it's a wonderful book to learn hibernate,"It's the best book about hibernate, you can learn how to hibernate works, how to configure it and how to apply the best performance for your applications.",2
Riccardo Audano,4.0 out of 5 stars,Java Persistence with Hibernate,"Deep as a Bible, Heavy as a Bible, Boring as a Bible","Technically speaking you cannot get much better than this. Java Persistence with Hibernate is accurate, complete, detailed, and full of practical examples. I know this expression is overused but this is really the definite reference, the Bible of Hibernate. Basically any rasonable question you might have about how to use this wonderful persistence tool is in this book.
My only gripe is that while this book makes a great reference or a great aid to the experienced developer to bring his hibernate skills to the best level, it fails miserably when used to learn Hibernate from scratch. It's a pity because with a little more effort this could have been the perfect Hibernate book. In particular, 90 % of the example code is from the 'Caveat Emptor' hibernate reference application. Perfectly nice to the veteran developer, but a beginner needs to see the code in action immediately, and building and analyzing 'Caveat Emptor' or translate the original code into his own 'experiments' will probably be way out of his reach. Finally, the writing style is lofty, self-conceited and abysmally boring, and fails to point out what is important from the (almost always) irrelevant details. This being said, Hibernate Foundations are all in this book, which makes a real treasure trove for a senior developer who has already fought a few battles with Hibernate. A good Hibernate intro book has still to be written, so my only advice to the newbie is try some online tutorials, maybe browse the hibernate official website, find something more 'human-friendly' and 'New-Testament-like' , get to play with Hibernate a little, to the point where you can write a very simple, even rudimentary application, and then you will be ready to start wrestling with this bible.",25
Quality Man,3.0 out of 5 stars,Java Persistence with Hibernate,I Dread Opening This Book,"It seems that many of the 3-star and less reviews here sum up my thoughts so I'll try not to repeat much of that. The worst part of this book is the horrible explanations and partial examples. Even when you find the section you are interested in you then have to wade through three different flavors of solutions: Hibernate with XML, Hibernate with annotations, and JPA. I should be pleased that I have more information but the problem is that these authors don't create clear boundaries among each technology. JPA should have been in a separate book, btw.

Hibernate has been the source of many, many problems on our project. These are often the mysterious bugs that leave us scratching our heads, and often the fixes to these problems are difficult as well. Yes, if our staff had a PhD in Hibernate we wouldn't run into many of these problems, but isn't it also a problem that a technology is so difficult to learn? It reminds me of EJB 1.0-2.0. Both make a lot of empty promises but end up causing frustration and lost time. A fun game we often play at work is ""How can we do what we want in Hibernate?"" In other words, we want to do things, but Hibernate makes achieving the task like solving a puzzle.

I hate Hibernate. I hate this beast of a book. And I hate books written by the creators of their own technology. The authors are arrogant and have a poor understanding of how to teach. I even had to read another book (Beginning Hibernate) in order to handle this book despite JPwH claiming to be useful for beginners. Despite by complaints, I give this book 3 stars because clearly a lot of work has gone into it plus it has helped out now and then, but boy do these guys know how to make things painful. In the end, I'd like to rip out Hibernate and switch to something like Ibatis SQLMaps, perhaps...

*** 2009 UPDATE *** We decided against Hibernate on our new project. I have also read the free 70+ page intro document on Ibatis SQLMaps. I'm now thoroughly convinced that SQLMaps is the direction our project should head. Much easier and less mysteries.",13
Sam,3.0 out of 5 stars,Java Persistence with Hibernate,Not as good as the first edition,"This book is still very informative, but it has grown to over 800 pages. It is no longer 'short and sweet'.

Alex,2.0 out of 5 stars,Java Persistence with Hibernate,Very badly written,"I've struggled through about 600 of the 1000 pages of this unnecessarily large book now and have come to the conclusion that there must be something else out there that is better written, more concise, and better structured. I'm not sure what it is, but my advice is to avoid this book. It sucks. The authors clearly are not native English speakers because the sentence structure is very awkward throughout the book. It makes reading very tiresome. They haven't put much thought into the structure either. There's no basic introduction or grounding for what Hibernate is or does. The more important chapters are buried at the back of the book. There's a huge lack of consistency and barely no examples to illustrate how to use Hibernate. They try to tackle too much all at once with Hibernate, JPA, and EJB. It's so overwhelming and it needn't be.

I got my hands on a copy of ""Hibernate In Action"", and surprisingly it is much more readable that this book. What a shame since JPwH is a *revised version* of HiA! The authors have revised it into uselessness.",4
Patrick Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Java Persistence with Hibernate,excellent,"Hibernate and JPA are rather large, complex technologies. You owe it to yourself to read a book like this for a thorough understanding. The I'll-pick-it-up-from-the-online-docs probably isn't going to be enough for this topic. This book provides outstanding coverage. It's well written, and since it comes from Hibernate's creators, provides lots of insight about *why* things were done in certain way.

I do have a relatively minor complaint about the organization of the book. I'd like to see the content about advanced mapping topics moved *after* at least a basic discussion of what ""conversations"" looks like, how persistence contexts behave, etc. I like to read books in order, and think the fundamentals should be addressed before all the nitty-gritty advanced details.",5

Can you believe that? They shine you on down the road to reference documentation. Complete turn off for a beginner. It is like the author is telling me, ""I don't have time to explain the basics to you and show you a simple working example. Go figure it out yourself and then come back here."" This may be a great reference for experienced Hibernate developers, but if you are a beginner, my advice to you is ""Back slowly away from this book. Just put it down gently and back far, far away.""

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Java Persistence with Hibernate,An utter waste,"The book is one of the most painful experiences I've had in recent time. I'm doing a Ph.D. right now. I know about pain.

Every chapter and section gives every minute detail of the APIs discussed, all the time. It's tough to describe how bad this makes it --- it feels like they're reading the code line by line and discussing every design decision made, in journal format. Paragraphs of side notes and gotchas are integrated right in the text, right in the normal text stream --- making it incredibly painful to filter out the important parts from the irrelevant. It's impossible to tell which parts are irrelevant until you're reading halfway into them, wasting the reader's time, patience, and memory. Then when you try to skip around, half the details you do need are just listed 'as discussed earlier.'

The examples cover little more than using single methods at a time. With the text being unreadable, it also lacks any coherent examples of even a basic application, putting anything they discuss together.

Fundamentally the text assumes that you're going to read and memorize every part of it before doing anything -- for over 800 pages, it's mindblowingly bad.

As a reference, the lack of organization guarantees you'll be digging through dozens of pages to get even basic answers. There is no reference material per se, it's all just reading through what you hope are relevant sections of the book. The index is only 16 pages, and completely worthless in helping you navigate.

3 stars for containing everything you need in there, somewhere. -1 star for being so sadistic about it. -1 star for being worthless as a reference.",39
Charles Hooper,2.0 out of 5 stars,Oracle Database 11gR2 Performance Tuning Cookbook,"Oracle Database Performance Tuning Test Cases without Many ""Why"", ""When"", and ""How Much"" Filler Details","I ordered the ""Oracle Database 11gR2 Performance Cookbook"" book shortly after it became available for purchase. I was very curious to see how the book compared with the similarly titled ""Oracle Database 11g Performance Tuning Recipes"" book, as well as some of the other Oracle Database performance books that are on the market. Packt is a fairly new book publisher, and this book marks the first Packt book in my collection.

The author of this book does not appear to be widely known in the international Oracle Database community, although it does appear that the author is an active reviewer of SQL Server and programming books on an Italian programming focused website. The author's LinkedIn page indicates that he obtained OCA and OCP certification in 2002 and 2003, respectively, has a variety of programming experience, and currently is an IT Manager.

One important characteristic of this book that is missing from some of the other Oracle Database performance focused books on the market is the extensive use of test case scripts throughout most of the book that allow the reader to reproduce the performance changes mentioned in the book, in the reader's Oracle Database environments. The test case scripts, related screen captures, and author's explanations of the results are both a blessing and a curse for this book. It appears that the author used a single Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud hosted database instance with only one set of instance parameters and system statistics for the various test case results and the author's descriptions of the expected outcome when the inputs in the test case script are provided. Had the author re-executed the test case scripts in another Oracle Database environment, the author probably would have written quite differently the explanations that follow the test case scripts. It is not uncommon for 80% of some of the book pages to be consumed by one or two SQL*Plus screen captures; combined with the slightly larger font sizes, double-spacing between paragraphs, and apparent one and a half spacing between lines in code sections, the technical content in the book is a bit more limited than the page count might suggest.

So, how well did the book's contents meet the level of expectations provided by the book's front cover and the publisher's description of the book? One of the bullet pointed descriptions of the book reads, ""Avoid common myths and pitfalls that slow down the database."" Unfortunately, the book reintroduces several myths and inaccurate conclusions about Oracle Database that have diminished in frequency during the last 10+ years. Some of the information in the book is of good quality. However, the significant number of inaccurate, vague, misleading, and/or over-generalized facts in this book suggests that the author of this book may have not received sufficient guidance from Packt and the four technical reviewers of the book. The book publisher's site currently lists no errata for the book, even though I personally submitted 21 errata items to the publisher's errata reporting site.

The author's native language is obviously not English, so it is probably to be expected that some of the sentences in the book are incomprehensible. Yet, there are also sentences in the book that use completely different phrasing, close to that of a person who double-majored in English and computer science with a focus on Oracle Database. The consistent usage of the term ""fields"" in some sections of the book, with the consistent usage of the term ""columns"" in other sections of the book is but one example of the style shift that is present in the book. Some of the sentences found in the book are oddly familiar, and although I was not able to identify the original sources of all of the oddly familiar sentences, I did manage to locate a few. What constitutes plagiarism in an Oracle Database book, and how much change is required to the original material to avoid the plagiarism label? Would slightly reformatting a section of text to replace dashes with colons be sufficient to avoid the label? Would changing the order of some sentences and eliminating other sentences be sufficient to avoid the label? Would performing simple word substitutions here and there, or shortening sentences be sufficient to avoid the label? I am not suggesting that there is rampant plagiarism in the book, but one does need to question when that plateau is reached in a book about Oracle Database.

While in some respects this book is more useful to the reader than the ""Oracle Database 11g Performance Tuning Recipes"" book due to the inclusion of test cases, both books seem to omit the reasoning behind why and when someone might consider performing the 80 or so tasks/recipes mentioned in the books. Vague, inaccurate, over-generalized, and out of date descriptions of Oracle Database behavior are limiting factors of both books. This review is quite long, and likely will not appear in full on Amazon - see my blog for the full review.

Comments, Corrections, and Problems:
* The book states, ""The first rule in writing applications which connect to an Oracle Database is to always use bind variables, which means not to include parameters in SQL statements as literals."" The statement should be clarified that this is a general recommendation. There are times when literals should be used rather than bind variables, for instance if there are very popular and unpopular values in a column, it might be wise to prevent the sharing of execution plans when a very popular or very unpopular value is used in the WHERE clause. A correction/clarification is provided on page 51 (page 8).

* Steps for creating a database with the Oracle Database Configuration Assistant seem to be out of place in a performance tuning book (pages 17-19)

* Uses the term ""fields"" where the term ""columns"" should be used (page 21).

* The book demonstrates the use of ANALYZE TABLE ... COMPUTE STATISTICS, and DBMS_UTILITY.ANALYZE_SCHEMA to collect object statistics. The book states that ANALYZE is retained for backward compatibility, but the book provides no warning that using ANALYZE to collect statistics could be problematic since the release of Oracle Database 8.1 (reference page 21).

* The book uses the word ""elaborate"" rather than ""create"" or ""generate"" (pages 24, 26, 27, 31, 37)

* The book demonstrates the use of AWR without first mentioning the licensing requirements of that feature (pages 30-31).

* Word substitution error: ""... and we experiment a lack of performance in another period, we can elaborate two reports..."" (page 31)

* The book demonstrates the use of ADDM without first mentioning the licensing requirements of that feature. The book also states, ""ADDM is enabled by default in Oracle Database 11g; it depends on two configuration parameters..."" Unlike with Oracle Database 10.1 and 10.2, ADDM is not enabled by default in the Standard Edition of Oracle Database 11.1 or 11.2, nor can it be legally enabled on the Standard Edition. While ADDM is enabled by default in the Enterprise Edition 11.1 and 11.2, it cannot be legally used without a Diagnostic Pack license (pages 32-35).

* The book suggests the system-wide use of the deprecated SIMILAR value for the CURSOR_SHARING parameter as one of two solutions to address a hard parsing problem in a test case script (page 38).

* The book states, ""Now the Soft Parse is 97.84 percent."" The output shown in the book actually indicates a Soft Parse percent of 99.20. The instance efficiency numbers in the output are identical to those found on page 40, so this might be an indication of a copy-paste error (page 39).

* The book states, ""If the PreparedStatement is not closed, it can be executed multiple times - changing the value assigned to bind variables - and only a `light' soft-parse will occur, with no syntax and semantic check."" If the SQL statement is held open - there will NOT be a ""light"" soft-parse (session cached cursors are not discussed in this section of the book, which would allow a ""light"" soft-parse if the cursor is NOT held open) (page 52).

* The elapsed time comparison between the directly executed SELECT statement, and the REFCURSOR that is returned by the SH.SALES_BY_PRODUCT procedure is not valid for a couple of reasons: 1) The script is executed by the internal user rather than a normal user, which can lead to unexpected performance differences; 2) The SELECT statement method displays its rows to the screen, so it is subject to delays caused by formatting the output for the SQL*Plus window (SET AUTOTRACE TRACEONLY STATISTICS may be used to reduce the impact of the formatting delays, but that change had little effect); 3) The REFCURSOR method, because it involves PL/SQL, will be subject to a context switch while the normal SELECT will not be subject to the context switch - the associated delay is operating system dependent and the timing should suggest that something is wrong with the test result; 4) While the normal SELECT statement test actually fetches the rows, the REFCURSOR method does not, as can be seen within an enabled 10046 trace (the normal SELECT will show a FETCH line that is preceded by WAIT lines, while the REFCURSOR method will not show a FETCH line in the trace file) (pages 54-55).

* The output of the Java version of the SQL*Plus test script found on pages 54-55 conflicts with the author's intended result. Directly executing the SQL statement required 1.438 seconds, while using the REFCURSOR in the Java code required 1.722 seconds. The performance difference may be more significant than shown, because the direct execution of the SQL statement test was performed first, and the timing results include the time to flush the shared pool and the buffer cache (the first call will almost certainly take longer than the second call) (pages 56-58).

* The book uses a test case script to demonstrate the negative effects of using a ""COUNTER"" table rather than using a sequence to provide the same counter value. The test case script uses a trigger on the table to populate the counter column in the table, and the test case script does show that performance improves with the use of the Oracle sequence. The test case script, however, should have also included a test that completely eliminates the trigger on the table, populating the TRAVELID column by including TRAVEL_SEQ.NEXTVAL directly in the SQL statement that populates the table. My timing results show that the counter trigger-table method completes in 0.45 seconds, the trigger-sequence method completes in 0.14 seconds, and the select-sequence method completes in 0.03 seconds (reference pages 60-62).

* Accidental word substitution, ""... and if the high watermark is reached, it caches other X numbers in the same manner."" ""other"" should be ""another"" (page 65).

* The author incorrectly read the AUTOTRACE generated execution plan. The book states ""We can see that in the execution plan, there is full table access to the SALES table examining 918K rows and reading 8075 KB."" An AUTOTRACE generated execution plan shows an estimated execution plan that may differ from the actual execution plan in some situations, such as cases where bind variables are involved. Additionally, an AUTOTRACE generated execution plan shows the predicted number of rows that will be returned (not examined), and the predicted volume of data that will be returned (not read) based on the existing statistics for the objects (page 67).

* The book states, ""However, from the execution plan, the number of rows processed is 72, and each row is 648 bytes long."" Once again it is important to stress that the execution plan is a predicted execution plan generated by AUTOTRACE. The estimated 72 rows returned by the operation in the execution plan does agree with the ""72 rows processed"" displayed in the actual statistics for the execution, but that will not always be the case for an AUTOTRACE generated execution plan (it happens to be the case because statistics were collected for the materialized view with a 100% sample rate). The statement that each row is 648 bytes long appears to be the result of misreading the previous execution plan, which estimated that 72 rows consuming 648 bytes total would be returned from operation 0 in the execution plan. The AUTOTRACE generated execution plan for the materialized view predicts that 72 rows consuming 1872 bytes will be returned from operation 0 in the execution plan, which shows a predicted row length of 1872/72 = 26 bytes per row (pages 67-68).

* The book states, ""In the latter case [after flushing the buffer cache], we have 4047 consistent gets and 240 physical reads..."" There are a couple of issues with this test case, found in the source code library file 2602_02_Materialized Views.sql. First, the script in the source code library uses ""ANALYZE TABLE SH.MV_SALES_BY_PRODUCT COMPUTE STATISTICS"" to collect the statistics on the materialized view, while the book shows the use of ""EXEC DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS"" to collect the statistics - the collected statistics from the ANALYZE table command could very easily be different from the collected statistics from the DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS command. The screen capture shown after flushing the buffer cache and re-executing the select from the materialized view does show 4,047 consistent gets and 240 physical block reads, as stated in the book, but it also shows 20,544 recursive calls where 0 recursive calls were shown prior to flushing the buffer cache - this recursive call count figure indicates that something else happened beyond the author flushing the buffer cache. My test results with just flushing the buffer cache show 8 consistent gets, 6 physical reads, and 0 recursive calls. The author also apparently flushed the shared pool, which triggered the recursive calls and the majority of the consistent gets and physical block reads (15,296, 2,978, and 177 respectively). The author probably should mention that the test case and advice will not work in a Standard Edition database, and should also state that the decision whether or not the materialized view is used is a cost-based optimizer decision (page 68).

* The book lists ""QUERY REWRITE"" as a required privilege to create materialized views. The Oracle Database 11.2 (and 10.1) documentation state that the QUERY REWRITE privilege is deprecated, and thus not needed (reference page 69).

* The book states, ""The same parameters [QUERY_REWRITE_ENABLED, and QUERY_REWRITE_INTEGRITY] have to be enabled to use another functionality, function-based indexes."" QUERY_REWRITE_ENABLED must be set to TRUE in Oracle Database 9.2 to use function-based indexes, but that requirement disappeared in Oracle Database 10.1 (page 70).

* The book states, ""We encounter row chaining when the size of the row data is larger than the size of the database block used to store it."" While this statement is correct, the book omits a secondary cause of chained rows - Oracle database supports a maximum of 255 columns in a row piece, so tables with more than 255 columns will necessarily have chained rows (page 84).

* The book casually demonstrates setting up a 16KB block size tablespace in a database that has a default 8KB block size. The book provides a list of several advantages for including smaller or larger than default block sizes in a single database including, ""Faster scans: tables and indexes that require full scans can see faster performance when placed in a large block size."" This justification is incorrect for several reasons including the fact that the DB_FILE_MULTIBLOCK_READ_COUNT parameter is scaled up for tablespaces that use a smaller than database default block size, and scales the parameter down for tablespaces that use a larger than database default block size. All of the justifications found on page 88 appear to be copied verbatim from a commercial website page. The book does not discuss the bugs and unexpected optimizer cost changes that might result from using multiple block sizes in a single database (reference reference2 pages 84-88).

* Step 5 contains two typos: using angle brackets (less than and greater than signs) rather than single quotes, and a spurious 3 after the semicolon (page 89).

* Step 7 and 9 contain typos: using angle brackets (less than and greater than signs) rather than single quotes (page 90).

* Steps 4 and 5 contain typos: using angle brackets (less than and greater than signs) rather than single quotes (page 97).

* Step 14 contains a corrupted SQL statement: ""CREATE.5* FROM HR.BIG_ROWS WHERE 1=0;"". Steps 15, 16, and 19 contain typos: using angle brackets (less than and greater than signs) rather than single quotes. The author should have mentioned at least one of the possible problems with this approach, which might include triggers on the table, foreign keys that point to the table, and the potential statistics problems caused by the use of the ANALYZE TABLE command (page 92).

* The book states about the DBMS_SPACE.CREATE_TABLE_COST example, ""In this procedure we have set the tablespace to use the average row size and the row count..."" The purpose of this function is to estimate space usage, not to make changes to a tablespace (page 95).

* Step 1 contains an extraneous "".5"" in the command.

* Pages 96-112 are present in the book, but omitted from this review.

* Steps 11 and 13 use angle brackets (less than and greater than signs) rather than single quotes (pages 116-117)

* The book states, ""We can also create a function-based descending index."" This is a strange statement - all descending indexes in Oracle Database are function-based indexes (page 119).

* The book states, ""... this test allows us to dispel a myth. Oracle uses the indexes even if the leading columns are not referenced in the WHERE predicate of the query. We can see that in such a case, the operation will be an INDEX FAST FULL SCAN."" In this case, the author is incorrectly attempting to generalize a special case into a general rule. Firstly, there is no myth to dispel - Oracle's query optimizer has had the ability to use INDEX SKIP SCAN operations when the leading column of an index is not specified in the WHERE clause, since the release of Oracle Database 9.0.1 a decade ago - but that access path is usually only advisable when there are few distinct values in the leading column of the index. The author's test case is a special case because all of the columns selected from the table are present in the index structure (page 119).

* The book states, ""If we use a regular index to access the data, Oracle is unable to do the sort in a mixed way, in a query like this."" The author then shows a SQL statement with the first column in the ORDER BY clause sorted in descending order and the second column in the ORDER BY clause sorted in ascending order. At this point in the book, the author has not yet stated that Oracle Database is able to read index entries in an ascending or descending order through a normal (ascending sorted) b*tree index, so this sentence in the book is confusing - almost to say that Oracle Database is not able to sort one column in ascending sequence and a second column in descending sequence - that concept is obviously false. It would have been more accurate for the book to state that, ""Oracle Database is unable to _avoid_ a sort operation when accessing the rows through a concatenated index if both of the columns in the index are sorted in ascending sequence, the ORDER BY clause of the SQL statement specifies that one and only one column contained in the index should be ordered in descending sequence, and the second column in the concatenated index is included in the WHERE clause."" (page 120)

* A self-contradicting sentence, ""In the first case, we have a full table scan, because we cannot retrieve all of the data from the index, so we have to do a TABLE ACCESS BY ROWID operation for each row, which satisfies the predicate."" Full table scan probably does not belong in that sentence (page 121).

* The book states, ""In the next screenshot, we can see that Oracle knows (from the table statistics) that only 43 rows satisfy the where condition."" It is important to stress that the autotrace generated execution plan only shows the estimated number of rows that will be returned by an operation - the author's query, in fact, retrieves a single row. The index that the author specified in the index hint was created on the columns CUST_LAST_NAME and CUST_YEAR_OF_BIRTH (in descending order), yet the author's query only included the CUST_FIRST_NAME column in the WHERE clause - it is ridiculous to force the optimizer to use this index with a hint (page 121).

* The index's clustering factor was not mentioned in the discussion of what determines the point at which it is more efficient to access a table through an index access path, rather than a full table scan - only the average row length was described as a consideration and the percentage of the rows that need to be retrieved. It could very well be the case that with a very poor clustering factor, that it is more efficient to retrieve less than 1% of the table's rows through a full table scan, rather than an index lookup (page 122).

* The book should define ""intra-block fragmentation"" which is the benefit that the book lists as resulting from rebuilding indexes (page 123).

* The two session example of one session rebuilding an index while a second session executes a SELECT and INSERT seems to be pointless. The second session does not use the index that the first session attempts to rebuild, instead a full table scan is performed on the BIG_CUSTOMERS table, followed by an index unique scan of the CUSTOMERS_PK index. An index named IX1_BIG_CUSTOMERS was created in the script, yet the script attempts to rebuild a non-existent index named IX1_MYCUSTOMERS. The test case only shows an example of efficiency gains due to blocks being buffered in the buffer cache. The book should have mentioned that an online rebuild and parallel rebuild are only possible in the Enterprise Edition of Oracle Database (pages 123-125).

* Step 10 uses angle brackets (less than and greater than signs) rather than single quotes (page 126).

* The book states, ""We have used the PARALLEL option too, to speed up the rebuild process."" While specifying PARALLEL during an index rebuild may speed up the rebuild, it is important to note that this results in an index with a parallel degree that should be manually reset to the original value, once the rebuild completed (page 127).

* The book states, ""However, when we have a table on which there are many INSERTs and DELETEs, we could schedule an index rebuild, because when deleting an index entry, the space is not freed in the index leaf, but just marked as deleted. If we have massive DELETE and INSERT operations, we could have a skewed index structure, which could slow performance due to intra-block fragmentation."" The book should have defined what is meant by ""skewed index structure"" - does the book mean, for instance, that one portion of the index could have a BLEVEL of 2 while another portion of the index could have a BLEVEL of 3 - if that is the case, the book's statement is incorrect. If the book's definition of ""skewed index structure"" is that some leaf blocks of the index will be more densely packed than other leaf blocks in the same index structure, then that should be considered normal behavior for Oracle indexes - an occasional coalesce might be used to combine index entries in logically adjacent leaf blocks, but scheduling index rebuilds is neither required, nor recommended. Depending on the order of the inserted values in relation to the order of the entries in the index leaf blocks, an index leaf block split operation could evenly divide the existing index entries between two leaf blocks (a 50-50 split, resulting in both index blocks being 50% utilized, if the inserted value is not the highest value that would be inserted into the leaf block), or all of the existing entries will remain in the existing leaf block and the new entry will be placed by itself into a new leaf block (a 90-10 split). A deleted index entry will remain in the block at least until that transaction is committed, but any post-transaction insert into the block will clear out all deleted index entries in the block. Deleting all table rows with index entries at the low end of the index (the values were populated by a sequence, for example, and are deleted in the same sequential order) could leave many blocks in the index structure with nothing but deleted index entries, but that situation should only result in a performance problem if SQL statements attempt to determine the minimum value for the indexed column, or to some extent, fast full index scans and full index scans (reference reference2 page 127).

* The book states, ""If the value for DEL_LF_ROWS/LF_ROWS is greater than 2, or LF_ROWS is lower than LF_BLKS, or HEIGHT is 4 then the index should be rebuilt."" Some of the advice found on the Internet suggests that if DEL_LF_ROWS is 20% of LF_ROWS, then the index should be rebuilt - did the author of this book intend to write ""If the value for DEL_LF_ROWS/LF_ROWS is greater than 0.2""? Why should the result of DEL_LF_ROWS/LF_ROWS be a consideration of whether or not an index should be rebuilt - is it supposed to measure the amount of wasted/unused space in the index leaf blocks? The next INSERT/UPDATE DML operation in a given leaf block will clear out the index rows that are flagged as deleted, but then does that imply that the space is not wasted (or is the space wasted)? What if there are many index blocks that are roughly 50% utilized due to a large number of 50-50 leaf block splits, is that space not wasted (or is the space wasted)? Since the formula DEL_LF_ROWS/LF_ROWS really does not describe the percent of used space in the index, it is probably best to just ignore the result of that formula. DEL_LF_ROWS/LF_ROWS can never be greater than 1 because the statistic found in the LF_ROWS column includes the DEL_LF_ROWS statistic. The second criteria suggests comparing LF_ROWS to LF_BLKS, such that if on average there is less than one index entry per leaf block, that the index should be rebuilt - there can never be less than one index entry per leaf block, because the leaf block will be detached from the index structure when all rows are removed from that leaf block. The final criteria suggests rebuilding the index when the height is exactly 4 - does that mean that an index with a height of 5, 6, 7, etc. does not need to be rebuilt? What if after rebuilding the index it still has a height of 4 - will it help to rebuild a second time? (page 127)

* The book states, ""When we rebuild an index, we can add the COMPUTE STATISTICS option to that statement."" Since the release of Oracle Database 10.1, statistics are automatically collected when indexes are created and/or rebuilt, so the COMPUTE STATISTICS clause is unnecessary (page 127).

* Steps 6 and 9 uses angle brackets (less than and greater than signs) rather than single quotes (page 128-129).

* Steps 8 and 15 uses angle brackets (less than and greater than signs) rather than single quotes (page 131-132).

* The book should mention that bitmap indexes are not available in the Standard Edition of Oracle Database (page 136).

* Step 3 uses angle brackets (less than and greater than signs) rather than single quotes (page 137).

* The author created a composite bitmap index with three columns to demonstrate the use of bitmap indexes. Composite bitmap indexes are rare - one of the strengths in using bitmap indexes is the ability to create multiple single column bitmap indexes, and as needed the optimizer will select to bitmap join two or more bitmap indexes in an attempt to significantly reduce the number of rows visited in the table (page 138).

* The book states, ""This time the execution plan uses the newly created bitmap index, ... using the INDEX RANGE SCAN or INDEX FAST FULL SCAN operation, depending on whether we are filtering on the first key column of the index - CUST_GENDER - or not. This result is obtained thanks to the structure of bitmap indexes."" With the index definition found in the book, the operations that should be present in the execution plan are BITMAP INDEX RANGE SCAN and BITMAP INDEX FAST FULL SCAN, while you might expect to find INDEX RANGE SCAN or INDEX FAST FULL SCAN operations associated with normal b*tree indexes. However, it is a cost-based decision for the optimizer to use or not use an index, so there is no guarantee that index will be used as indicated in the book if the leading column in the index is either specified or not specified. Additionally, it is not the structure of bitmap indexes that permits INDEX RANGE SCAN or INDEX FAST FULL SCAN operation, depending on whether we are filtering on the first key column of the index - creating a normal b*tree index in the script rather than a composite bitmap index could (will) actually allow the optimizer to take advantage of INDEX RANGE SCAN or INDEX FAST FULL SCAN operations (page 139).

* The book states, ""Bitmap indexes offer very fast performance when we have a low cardinality field indexed on a table containing many rows."" This statement could have several different interpretations, but I believe that the author's intended meaning is ""Bitmap indexes offer significantly faster performance than b*tree indexes when columns with few distinct values are indexed in tables containing a significant number of rows."" This fixed statement still requires additional clarification - if the bitmap index does not help to further reduce the number of table rows that are accessed through the index, the end result may be performance that is roughly the same as that of an equivalent b*tree index. One way to accomplish the task of further reducing the number of table rows accessed is through the utilization of multiple bitmap indexes with bitmap combine operations to significantly reduce the number of rowids that are used to fetch table rows (page 139).

* The book states, ""When rows are frequently inserted, deleted, and updated, there is a performance bottleneck if we use a bitmap index. When the index is updated, all the bitmap segments are locked."" This statement requires a bit of clarification. I do not believe that the author is stating that updating an entry in a bitmap index will lock all of the bitmap indexes in the database (a segment could be a table, table partition, index, etc.). Instead, I think that the author is intending to state that updating an entry in a bitmap index will lock all of the index entries in that index, effectively preventing any other session from inserting, updating (the column covered by the index), or deleting rows in the table. For very small bitmap indexes, this statement could very well be true. However, for larger bitmap indexes, built for tables with many rows, the number of index rows that will be locked during an update is determined by the number of rows covered by the index block(s) that update changed, possibly 20,000 to 50,000 rows per index block. (page 139 reference slide 46, reference2 page 2, reference3 comments section).

* The book states, ""This [bitmap join index] is a bitmap index which represents the join between two tables, and can be used instead of a materialized view in certain conditions."" The book did not offer any suggestions or describe any conditions that permit a bitmap join index to take the place of a materialized view. The statement in the book needs additional clarification (reference reference2 page 140).

* The book states about index organized tables, ""If the row size exceeds the size indicated by this parameter [PCTTHR",17

MO,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enterprise JavaBeans (3rd Edition),Outstanding Coverage of a Large Subject,"I started out knowing very little about EJB's when I picked up this book. I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed!

The first three chapters give a 10,000 foot view about the role of EJB's in J2EE. Bean lifecycles are covered, container interaction, deploytment processes, etc. is all covered in a general and friendly manner. A little bit of code is presented to illustrate key points and help you start thinking about how to write code.

The chapters following really drill down into the guts of entity, session (state and stateless), and message driven EJBs. Simple code examples are presented and taken apart, with detailed explanation about why certain things are the way they are, and how things work. Outstanding theory here! You get down into the nitty gritty about deployment descriptors, state diagrams, the works.

There are also nice reference Appendices providing state transition diagrams, API references, etc.

What impressed me most about this book is the author's careful distinction between EJB 1.1 and EJB2.0 specifications, including code samples of each, and the raw level of detail about how beans work.

The bad part about this book is it assumes you know a lot of other fundamental technologies such as XML, JNDI, and JMS. I highly recommend you have references available on these technologies during reading if you're trying to learn the big picture at the same time. People who are really into code examples and not theory may also be a little disappointed by the simplicity of the examples given.

All in all a great buy!",13

Very rarely have I seen a book of this level of detail and quality at the same time. The author presents the topics in very clear tone, so it is easy to follow. The author does repeat same concepts sometimes but I found it to be helpful to remember. There are tons of examples spread through out many chapters. The JBoss workbook provided in the second part of the book is by itself worth the price of this book. Clear instructions and explanations are provided as part of this workbook. I tested all examples in the book in JBoss 4.x and with a couple of exceptions noted here, they run fine. My only disappointment with this book relates to the chapters on web services - the explanation was not good enough to follow nor was I able to get the examples to run in JBoss. However, this is not a book on web services, so I guess it is ok. I highly recommend this book to any one who wants to learn EJB's especially by testing the many examples given in this book.

I dont understand one thing, and thats my ding for this book, and that it took the author 4 chapters to explain Entity Beans, to be re-implemented (Make your life and our lives easier - look at Hibernate) out in next release of EJB 3.0 specifications. And do a rush job on explaining J2EE Services ( Sessions as Endpoints ). To me, it should have been reversed.

Also, as indicated by the author, what a piece of crap the Timer Service is. Its like as if we needed another reason to crash the server.

Chapt. 16 Transactions was very interesting and I was intrigued by it. I would have dinged this book to 3 star rating, but his coverage on JMS ( Hurray to the Unified API ) and Transactions earned him the 4 star rating.

Also, it would have been nice to see versions of this book along with workbooks for other servers such as Weblogic or Websphere. That way, one can choose which version to pick up. As you know, just because you know how to do it in one server, means nothing to a stupid hiring firm, if you have not used the same in their server.",3
Alex P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enterprise JavaBeans (3rd Edition),Very good text,"This book is a great EJB starter. I picked it up for a new project and had no problems working through how EJBs worked and how they needed to be coded. Mind you, the type-os and mistakes were corrected on his website and the examples only worked when I downloaded them. Some theory could have been explained a little more in depth because some parts left more questions than answers (in my mind, maybe not so for others). Otherwise it is easy to understand, very well laid out and for someone starting out with EJB (especially with BEA WebLogic) it is an excellent text. I don't normally write reviews but this book made it possible for me to get an EJB project started, coded and completed. Not many books in my library can fit that description.",3
Sisu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enterprise JavaBeans (3rd Edition),"Very readable, well done","I'm one of those guys under pressure to transition from working in Visual Basic to the whole J2EE ball of wax (company policy now), and it's been a challenge to find Java books that teach *both* OOP principles and the syntax/implementation details of Java technologies. A consultant at work recommended the 3rd edition as a great EJB book for newbies and experts alike, and I concur. This book was really a pleasure to read, and compared to other EJB works, they did a superb job fitting just enough of the information that really matters into about 500 pages. The use of diagrams was also very well done, the authors seemed to sense when a reader might be getting to the point where a picture could clarify what was going on. Well done!",4
John M. Harby,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enterprise JavaBeans (3rd Edition),Saving grace,"I don't want to go into detail, the other reviewers do a very good job of this. However, as someone who has been working with EJB almost since its inception, Haefel's books have been a saving grace since there is so little other documentation. You can actually check out Sun's EJB-interest mailing list and see Haefel participating in discussions with the architects from EJB vendors (like Sriram Srinivasan of Weblogic) and
Sun designers of the spec itself like Vlada Matena. Basically it is apparent that this guy has really done his homework. If I were required to make critical suggestions:
1.) Keep the EJB versions in separate books - it is difficult to use this as a working 1.1 reference with 1.0 code all over. Please get a 1.2 version out asap!
2.) Due to your experiences from the beginning, have another book that attacks the more advanced issues such as clustering architecture, etc.",5
Riccardo Audano,3.0 out of 5 stars,Enterprise JavaBeans (3rd Edition),upside-down,"Ok, let me start by saying that the author of this book is indeed well prepared and able to go into detail in his explanations. If you are really interested in programming with EJB this is one of the books you should check, despite its many flaws.. The first three chapter make
a fully successful attempt to protect the mysteries of J2EE from
profane eyes by putting a deep sleep spell on the reader.
If you survive it you will probably find yourself wondering about the order in which the story is told...
First a hurried example involving a session bean collaborating with an entity bean, then one chapter on the client side (which of course you need to understand how the heck you could have tested the beans just developed), then entity beans get presented again but this time in more detail.. only you get to know first the CMP flavour (which is the more complicated) and the BMP flavour after, totally against what common sense would advice. Then you go into session beans, which , being simpler than entities should have been presented before..and how about a chapter 16 on deployment descriptors? They are the configuration files you need to deploy ANY EJB and you explain them at the end of the book? The impression is this author would be much better if he stopped thinking by compartments
and trying to make things appear much more difficult and deep than what they actually are. Also, the workbooks with the exercises for this text are a joke. You will be presented with
canned code and a few ant scripts to execute, compile, build
deploy and run the code. Very kewl but if you know what you are doing you can do it yourself and if you don't .. well clicking on a few batch files or executing ant scipts won't teach you much I can assure you..",12

It is not that it is overly technical, or badly written, just that it is so bland and uninspiring. Part of the problem is that I am starting to realise that EJB is not going to solve all the problems I hoped it would (well container managed persistence did sound too good to be true!). Nevertheless, I do not feel that this is the book we have all been waiting for and advise caution.",2

If you are looking for any depth or meaningful examples in terms of why you use a session bean versus an entity bean, this is not the book for you. In terms of covering the low-level mechanics of using EJBs, this book is adequate. The scenario used to demonstrate the use of EJBs is so simplistic as to be of no value whatsoever.
To summarize, this book lacked any insight or depth and was little better than vendor documentation.",8

Everybody I talk to here thinks the book is terrible (contradicting what a previous reader from purdue thought). The code is very useless and could be implemented in much better ways. They don't even explain what they are doing in their code! I also found the explaination of induction and big O notation to be patheticly short since that is a big part of the course. A book like this should focus more heavily on this and analyzing different loops to make a determination of their running times in functions. The main point of any book in cs is to provide real programming projects and take the reader through the development of them. This book glosses over very important topics like the ones I mentioned and seems to make it a goal of trying to confuse the reader. In short, there are much better books on this subject.",4
stochasticmind,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Analysis and Probability: Wavelets, Signals, Fractals (Graduate Texts in Mathematics)",not a textbook,"I believe this book is only useful as lecture notes and not a textbook for those who do not have access to the actual classes.
It is not written in the proper and systematic way. The author for example uses the ""."" notation for a variable without stating what it means. He introduces # notation as cardinality of a set without telling you right there that # stands for cardinality (it is in the list of symbols but it is not referred to where it must) Chapters are likewise disorganized and sections do not build up understanding.
The author wants to be creative and introduce ideas from multiple directions. This is an advantage for a workshop or class environment but don't waste your time and money if you are interested in fractals, or probability or wavelets or signal processing or harmonic analysis.... instead buy the standard focused texts. There is no royal road to mathematics but there are good textbooks and this is not one of them. I did not give it one star because if you already know all of these subjects, perhaps this book is good essay in how they relate to each other. The author should have simply put these notes on his webpage for free rather than create a textbook out of them. It is now days a custom to make a textbook out of poorly developed notes; it is unfortunate.",3

This is an excellent reference in GIS literature that introduces hundereds of terms in a reasonable size and good price. The author went to the very corners of GIS-data-base structure. For any GIS-term you can find an illustration and explanation. The text is clearly written by an ArcInfo User that is some how ""heavy"". However,as an ArcGIS/ArcView user it was useful for me. The book title is somehow misleading at the first glance, but when you go inside, you can see no other title can fit this topic. BUY IT, if you want to know the GIS terminology to the extreme details, including backgrounds, comparative explanations and so on. DON'T BUY IT, if you want to do GIS modelling buy reading this book, as the text is mostly concentrates on data base.",14
Perry Marshall,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Information Theory, Evolution, and the Origin of Life",A Rock-Solid Mathematical and Conceptual Foundation for Genetics,"About 7 years ago I waded into the huge subject of evolution and origin of life. As an electrical engineer I was quickly appalled at the confusion, the endless opining, indulgent name-calling, and quantity of intellectual slop that passed for science in biology.

This was one of the first books I found that brought the level of rigor to biology that people in the hard sciences (Physics, Engineering, Computer Science) are accustomed to. If most discussions about biology seem ""squishy"" to you, that's because they are. This book is a refreshing departure.

Others here have complained that Yockey is dogmatic. He is, and he's earned the right to be. Most of what Yockey says is as right and as black and white as 1's and 0's. Claude Shannon's 1948 model for digital communication laid the foundation for our modern digital age and Shannon's work is flawless. In this book Yockey shows that the genome is *isomorphic* (structurally identical) with Shannon's model for digital communication.

Yockey says, ""Information, transcription, translation, code, redundancy, synonymous, messenger, editing, and proofreading are all appropriate terms in biology. They take their meaning from information theory (Shannon, 1948) and are not synonyms, metaphors, or analogies.""

This isomorphism is crucial to establishing any rigorous mathematical framework for modeling evolution in software. It's a required assumption for studying evolution as a computational process; for establishing a sound mathematical framework for the history of evolution (which still for the most part does not exist), and for clarifying the difference between assumptions and truth in evolutionary theories.

Yockey rightly points out that the laws of the genetic code are not derivable from physical laws and that even the simplest genome contains more information than all the laws of physics put together. This is why he says, ""I have no doubt that if the historic process leading to the origin of life were knowable it would be a process of physics and chemistry. Thus the process of the origin of life is possible but unknowable.""

For this reason he takes the position that the existence of the genetic code must be taken an axiom, a required but unprovable assumption. He shows the vast chasm exists between life and non life. Any attempt to argue otherwise muddles definitions and conflates the laws of physics with the freely chosen rules of codes. As a communications engineer, I understand that two could not be more different. Yockey puts it this way:

""The existence of a genome and the genetic code divides living organisms from nonliving matter. There is nothing in the physico-chemical world that remotely resembles reactions being determined by a sequence and codes between sequences.""

The book does contain a few statements I disagree with. Crick's central dogma, which Yockey espouses, has since been shown to be wrong; cells do modify their own genomes based on inputs from the environment. The genome is a read/write storage system, not read-only. And evolution is not a random walk; it is driven by transposition, horizontal gene transfer, symbiogenesis, epigenetics and whole genome duplication, all of which are non-random. Authors like Lynn Margulis, Barbara McClintock and James Shapiro elaborate on these points in detail. However, the mechanisms of evolution are not the focus of this book so this is only a minor issue.

Engineers have very high expectations of theoretical models. As well they should; if they don't, bridges and buildings fall down and people die. Yockey brings the standards that are normally found in engineering to biology. Some biologists will be offended at this; that can only be expected when someone ushers in knowledge from outside their field that highlights the shortcomings of their assumptions.

In any case this book is a tremendous contribution to the field because it opens the door for a systems view of biology, in contrast to the traditional straitjacket of insisting that ""it's all just complex physics and chemistry."" It's not all just physics and chemistry because genomes literally and not figuratively process information. Living things are information driven and systems oriented. Little progress can be made without a solid foundation in digital communication. Yockey's work lays that foundation.",10

The book is heavy on examples but there is not a lot of text that tells you HOW to catalog. However, the AACR2 book, the information from the professor and various online resources like MARC21 and OCLC web sites filled that gap.

As with any programming book, you get what you put in, so read and code. Some topics may seem too easy and there is a temptation to just skip them, resist the temptation and follow the structure.

Russ Gifford,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pro Access 2010 Development (Expert's Voice in Office),GREAT BOOK!,"This could be a text book for people looking to create nimble applications for small businesses. Except is doesn't read like a text book, which is a plus. While I have seen many of the pieces within this book in other books, I've never found ALL of them in ONE book - until now.

OK - have not gotten completely through it - and if you are experienced at creating and deploying Access databases / applications, it might be too simple. (I'd be surprised if that were so, but check out the look inside feature to see.)But starting simple is a good thing - it is perfect for people tackling this subject for the first time.

I still found some gems every few pages even in the basics of the beginning chapters!

But after skimming the first two or three chapters, I jumped in quickly when the subheading caught my attention! The author does a great job of integrating the VBA stuff into the book at every opportunity as well - another big plus!

I am enjoying this book - and learning from it. If I am every in the position to TEACH an Access Development class, trust me, this is the book I will use! And if you want to learn detailed tricks that Access can provide you as a developer's platform - this is the book for you!",1
M,5.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks) 1st (first) edition Text Only,best intro to R I've found,"I'm a long time Matlab user, but have been using R for a couple months now. Still on the fence on their relative merits (they're different, let me say), but it's been interesting. I had the help of friends, but this book got me going. I bought probably 10 books, and this is far and away the best place to start. Nice combination of keeping it simple and still giving you a sense of the logic of the software. What it doesn't have is details about specific things (graphics, for example), but it gets you close enough that you can usually figure the rest out for yourself. Great book, well written, good coverage of topics -- at least for my use (analysis of international macroeconomic data).",56
Kelly Maurice,5.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks) 1st (first) edition Text Only,A High Quality Book On R Programming!,"This is an excellent book. I read it from cover to cover. I did not try out the examples however. I found the writing to be very good and the book, although a cookbook, actually provides a great way to get an in depth overview of R. The R packages facilitate the use of the book examples by providing test data in the packages. The book is organized well, especially the file I/O and data structures, as well as the statistics sections.

I have worked with statistics at various levels over the years and taken courses but I wanted to brush up on concepts and applications, and this book was really good for that. I think it is also a decent book for learning programming although one would start using the 1-based paradigm instead of 0-based for indexing and that is kind of nonstandard and used only for math software. But a beginner could learn quite a bit by just playing around with the examples.

The explanations of the statistics concepts was particularly good. The author is very precise with his language and even repetitive (which I appreciated) about the rigorous interpretation of results.

The R software thankfully provides a well designed, open source alternative to Matlab and this cookbook (with its references) is an ideal place to start learning for practical use at work or on projects. I thoroughly recommend it. I found very few typos which for me is one of many quality indicators. The author also writes in an entertaining style making the book fun to read - which is a challenge considering the subject matter could be considered dry (by some).",1

It can not only save you plenty of time, but also help you to gain new insights as you learn from comprehensive but short and clear discussions of so many different topics. They are all explained in a such a way that you can directly access anyone of them without having to read the rest of the book. Some highlights:
- The chapter 2 on ""Some Basics"" is simple but mandatory for any beginner.
- Chapter 5 on ""Data Structures"" is one of the best along with Chapter 12 on ""Useful Tricks"". Chapter 5 covers data structures in a clearer and better way than many other books on R.
- Chapter 6 on ""Data Transformations"" shows the beauty and power of R in short but very good examples.
- Statistics with R is covered in Chapter 8 on ""Probability"" and chapter 9 on ""General Statistics"", whereas Chapter 11 covers ""Linear Regression and ANOVA"". Here again the very clear prose and simple examples show these applications of R in a much better way than books on R and ""advanced analytics"" like ""R for Everyone"" (a book that is a big disappointment).
- There is a good coverage of graphics in Chapter 10, whereas the author still found space to treat time series analysis in Chapter 14 with more brilliant examples.
What is missing? A coverage of RStudio, a great and free development environment for R. There is also a lack of any examples covering statistical learning data analysis other than linear regression which actually belongs more to standard statistical analysis.

Sometimes one wants to know how to code something specific and sometimes one wants to know how how to set up a class of problems. This book covers both of these in clear and concise language.

I bought one copy for the office and one for my house. This guy has the ability to write simply and with the mind set of people who are busy and want to get results right away. Of course we'd all love to be leisurely scholars and plow through theory and practice but most of us just need to get things done. A good example is the way he treats ARIMA. He warns you about using auto.arima but does not hide it from you because it is ""dangerous."" The book is full of tips, well organized and is oriented towards beginners, though it gets into depth. So many of the R books I've read absolutely pound you with up front details, some of which relate to obscure concerns, rather than starting with a task. For example, on page 199 he writes ""Problem -- you want to count the relative frequency of certain observations in your sample"" Next is ""Solution"" -- and he explains just the minimum needed to do that job. Some of the tips are just simple time savers, such as the function head(dataframe) to show a few of the dataframe rows at the start and tail(dataframe) to show a few at the end. Finally ....

It's very good for someone who is looking for a quick solution, but as in all cookbooks it's not exhaustive-how could it be
in such a short place. This is why I think that a second edition will be welcome, so that it covers more ground.

The writing style is absolutely first rate, I agree with the other reviewer who says you'd wish the author would write a lot more books. He really has a knack of making it look easy.

This book provides a very useful roadmap to a core of R capabilities. It's organized into a series of related 'recipes' which provide clear explanations of the problem being solved, R code for solving the problem, and an explanation of what the R code is doing. I recommend it highly!",1
GrandMoff Burton,4.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks) 1st (first) edition Text Only,"Great examples, good for learning and reference","I love the organization of this book. You need a quick example of code with a clear description? This is the book to get. Great for learning from scratch, and reference. For more complete treatments of R, it should be paired with another book, but this is a must buy for people who want to become proficient in the software",1
pogo sketch,4.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks) 1st (first) edition Text Only,really a good hands on book,The R cookbook provides a structured and pragmatic approach for many analytical challenges.

Eleuthero,5.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks) 1st (first) edition Text Only,Quick and Dirty Hacks are 90% of Usage,"I thought Paul Teetor did a great job here. Although he claims it's not a book to learn R, in conjunction with a basic R book like ""The Art of R Programming"" by Matloff, this book is all you need to learn the hundreds of idioms that make up the daily practice of using any language. However, Mr. Teetor undersells himself by not claiming that it's a book for learning R because I have found it BETTER than Matloff's book as a ""go to"" book whenever I've forgotten something.

Matloff's book, while good, is desultory in a certain sense because it hops around its topics too much and uses tools yet to be covered much later in the book in current examples. The R Cookbook has a beautiful systemization to it. For example, you don't have to wait 'til the middle of the book to see how to see how to read into all the basic R data structures. I/O, usually under-covered in all programming books, has a vital early appearance in Teetor's book.

His order of coverage is fabulous and he doesn't bamboozle readers with ""real world"" examples in each chapter that cover advanced features that are promised to be explained ""later"". If you need to know something that's in his code, you get your explanation NOW, not LATER.",1
Governor,4.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks) 1st (first) edition Text Only,A cookbook for takeaway not cordon blue,"As others have said, this has lots of useful stuff in it. But dont use it as a statistics guide. The section on testing for mean reversion in time series is really just about how to use the ADF test. There is a good deal more to mean reversion than this. Likewise I noticed an assertion that a high adjusted R-squared is unambiguously a good thing. Time series people should know better. Having had the book for just a day I am pretty certain I'll find other minor bloopers to complain about.

Otherwise, a very useful contribution",5
Our House,5.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks) 1st (first) edition Text Only,"Good book, Kindle Annoyances hurt use as reference","The book is 5-star as described by earlier reviewers. The kindle version has annoyances.

Like many, I'd like to replace thick, heavy reference books with electronic docs. My hardware is an ipad, but kindle works nicely on many devices. But for REFERENCE use, this volume's got a problem: The Table of Contents! Here's a fragment:

4.12. Reading Files with a Complex Structure
Problem
Solution
Discussion
See Also
4.13. Reading from MySQL Databases
Problem
Solution
Discussion
See Also

The same, identical subheads are REPEATED under virtually EVERY SECTION HEADING. With a reference, one wishes to quickly scan the list of topics covered. In kindle form, one can see at most 6 or 7 topics per page. Plus ""Problem, Solution, Discussion and See Also"" REPEATED 6 or 7 times per page! Really?

When viewing the book's ""Look Inside"" on the Amazon website, ""Problem, Solution, Discussion and See Also"" are not spewed throughout the Table of Contents. Presumably that is the image of the print version. So one can see about 40 topics per page while flipping thru the Contents in the print volume. And 6 topics on the kindle? I just want to know how can I get my kindle copy to be so useful and eliminate the annoying, useless repetition. Am I missing some trick here?

An orderly, repetitive structure is valuable in computer language cookbook topic treatments. Reproducing this standard structure 6 times a page in the Contents, crowding out useful information....is a painful annoyance. With a reference, one expects to repeatedly scan the topics. I can't believe the author permitted this. But I'm not dropping a star because this problem is with whoever created the kindle version, not with the book.",11
John M. Ford,4.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks) 1st (first) edition Text Only,O'Reilly R Reference,"The R statistical analysis tool has much to recommend it to students, researchers, and commercial data analysts. It contains a powerful set of analysis and graphics commands and a constantly-growing number of add-on packages produced by its large user community. R and most of its add-ons are also available for free under an open source license. It is a realistic and readily available rival to major commercial tools such as SAS and SPSS.

As with everything, there is a downside. R is accessed through a command line interface, has an overwhelming number of commands, and its syntax is difficult to learn and remember. R users, especially novices, will find this cookbook of tremendous help. It contains many brief sections, each of which lists example R code for a specific analysis task.

Tasks supported range from downloading and installing R through more complex data analysis. The sections I found most useful were:

- Finding Relevant Functions and Packages
- Performing Matrix Operations
- Editing a Data Frame
- Generating Reproducible Random Numbers
- Plotting Multiple Data Sets
- Predicting a Binary-Valued Variable (Logistic Regression)

Paul Teetor has produced a well-organized and useful reference book. The sections are straightforward and the example R code is no more complex than necessary. The explanations in each sections are instructive, yet concise. Numerous cross-links between sections allow readers to understand related tasks when writing more complex code. There are even a few sections on common R error messages and useful programming tricks. I recommend this book to anyone working with R who already has some background in data analysis with one or more other software tools.

Note: The book comes with an offer from the published to purchase upgrades as new versions are released. This seems like a good idea, but I have no experience with this from O'Reilly.",7
Dennis,3.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks) 1st (first) edition Text Only,It's OK but does not beat googling,"My all time favorite cookbooks is the Data Mining Cookbook by Olivia Par Rudd and another favorite book is the Little SAS Book. These preferences reveal my SAS (and SPSS) background. The comparison with Rudd's book is a little unfair because Rudd's is a cookbook for a vertical subject which the R Cookbook is not intended to be. The Little SAS Book, however, would have been a good little volume to model the R Cookbook after --especially as many R users reading these types of books are newcomers from SAS.

Had I read the R Cookbook book twenty years ago, I would have loved it. As I have it in the Kindle version, however, its competition is the forums in Google and I found myself more eager to try the forums first.

For beginners in R like me, however, buying it does add a degree of security in the undertaking so I do not regret buying it.",3
I. Vining,4.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks) 1st (first) edition Text Only,A bit basic but okay,So far the book is fairly basic and does not cover R as well as I would like. If you are doing more serious statistical work in R I would suggest a different book.,1

bill luecke,2.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks) 1st (first) edition Text Only,Mostly ideas you could have gottten from the man pages,"I'm not a statistician, but I've used R for analyzing data for about four years now. I had hoped that this book would be a real ""cook book"" that would unlock some secrets that would make more more effective. I expected that I would have the book lying open next to my keyboard. But I think it will just sit on my bookshelf, unused.

Most of the book just summarizes what you could learn from reading the on-line help. I expected detailed worked examples. The structure of the books follows a 'You want to do this, here's how to do it"" format. But the ""you want to do this"" sections are more like ""You want to use xyplot, here's the function call."" But I can read about that from the command line. Not helpful.

Perhaps the book would be useful for someone just starting out, but there are plenty of on-line PDF versions of ""Intro to R"" books that you can print out for free.

I feel like a spent $30 for nothing.",36
